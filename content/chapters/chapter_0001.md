"Waah. Waah."

Vincent woke up with a frown. In the silent mountains where even the birds had gone to sleep, the sound of a newborn baby's crying could be heard.

"Waah. Waah."

Even as he shook his disheveled hair and rubbed his sleepy eyes, the baby's pitiful wailing continued.

"Dear God, what have I done so wrong?"

Getting down from his bed, Vincent looked back at his wife who was deep in slumber. He hoped she was having happy dreams. If she heard this sound, she would surely be tormented.

Vincent and his wife had been married for seven years but had no children. They had spent expensive money to visit physicians, but all they got was that the cause was unknown.

"There's something called compatibility between couples. It's just one of those things. Neither you nor Olina seem to have any particular problems, so try more often. Heh heh!"

Vincent had burst into hearty laughter at first. It was true that their relationship had improved thanks to the physician's prescription.

But as they entered their fifth year of marriage, he had to admit it.

He could not have children.

His wife Olina had never once shown any resentment. But whenever she looked at other families' children with a lonely expression, Vincent couldn't help but curse his own lower body.

"What kind of bastard's doing this, adding salt to someone's wounds!"

Due to the nature of being a hunter, most lived in houses built in the mountains. They had to check traps every hour, and when tracking wild animals for days on end, they needed a base camp in the mountains.

There would be no one looking for a hunter's house at this hour. Unable to rule out the possibility of bandits, Vincent grabbed his single-edged axe and went outside.

"Who's there! Who's making noise in the dead of night!"

Vincent shouted so loud that the mountain echoed. No one answered, and only his shout returned as an echo.

It might be a merchant dealing in specialty goods, but no matter how much he looked around, he couldn't see even a common torch.

Vincent grew more tense and gripped his axe handle tightly. Then he slowly moved forward, following the sound of the baby's crying.

The sound was coming from the stable.

The possibility of bandits was high. He had heard in the slash-and-burn farming village that those who plundered the wealth of people living alone in the mountains were becoming rampant.

"Damn bastard! I'll cut you to pieces!"

In the worst case, blood would have to be spilled.

With such determination, Vincent threw open the stable door. At the same time, he examined the interior with a mountain man's excellent senses.

Whinnying.

Hearing the peaceful snorting of horses, his mind calmed somewhat. Animals don't lie.

The stable where two horses slept was narrow and cozy. Therefore, there was nowhere to hide. But surprisingly, there were no signs of anyone having entered.

"But how is there crying?"

Vincent carefully moved and examined the area covered with straw. A newborn baby about two months old was crying.

Feeling an inexplicable holiness, he hid the axe behind his back. Then, thinking this too was impious, he threw it into a corner altogether and crawled toward the baby.

"Waah. Waah."

When he opened the swaddling clothes with his rough hands, there was a baby as pretty as the moon. An innocent baby who knew nothing, who had just encountered the world's air.

Vincent's pupils trembled. Then, as if struck by lightning, he shook his body and, unable to control his emotions, burst out of the stable.

"Who is it! Who's playing tricks! Abandoning a child, you damn bastard! Come out quickly!"

Echoes rang out as if several people were speaking.

"Come out! Really not coming out? How can you abandon a child! You're really a bad person! You know?"

He pressed again, but no one answered.

"You really abandoned it! There are no more chances! Just try appearing in front of me later! I'll turn your face into mush!"

Vincent shouted with the loudest voice of his life. He didn't want to leave any regrets when he looked back on today in the distant future.

Vincent went back into the stable. Perhaps tired from crying, the child had fallen asleep peacefully. With trembling hands, he embraced the baby and gently placed his ear against the small chest.

The heart was beating.

"Honey, what's wrong?"

His wife Olina came into the stable, breathing heavily. Vincent's voice had been so loud that she was completely awakened from sleep.

Vincent stared blankly at his wife as if speechless, then showed her the child sleeping in his arms.

"What is that child?"

"Well... it seems to be our child."

* * *

Early summer when greenery was abundant.

Vincent hummed as he hurried along the path where cold stream water flowed. A large roe deer hung over his shoulder, but despite his large frame, his movements were light.

As his house drew near, his steps quickened even more. The faces of his precious family members were already dancing before his eyes.

"Shirone, daddy's home!"

"Daddy!"

A twelve-year-old boy burst into a bright smile and ran to the entrance. Unlike the rough, rock-like Vincent, Shirone had grown into a beautiful boy as if specially cherished by God.

His hair flowed like golden silk, his blue eyes, and his straight nose despite not being fully grown made him look like a doll. Whenever he saw such a son, Vincent's chest swelled with pride and his shoulders straightened.

Embracing Shirone, he buried his face in his son's nape and took a deep breath. His son's scent cleanly swept away the fatigue of his arduous mountain journey.

"Yes, my son. My treasure. Have you been well?"

"Yes. I helped mom with cooking and read many books."

Cooking and books.

Vincent felt awkward at the discord between the two words. But he didn't show it and burst into hearty laughter.

"Do you like books that much?"

"No, well... there's nothing else to do."

Seeing his son hide his emotions like someone who had done something wrong, Vincent felt sorry and apologetic.

In fact, he knew too. That this miraculous child given by heaven was unusually intelligent.

Olina knew a little writing, but she was still a mountain man's wife. Nevertheless, Shirone had fumbled through letters with what he learned and now reached the level of reading books alone.

That made his heart ache even more.

A hunter's child cannot study.

An herbalist's child becomes an herbalist, a hunter's child becomes a hunterâ€”that was the only way to make a living.

No matter how humble the occupation, there are secrets and techniques that cannot be passed on by word alone. All that poor Vincent could pass on to his son was hunting skills.

But Vincent couldn't bring himself to say it. Twelve years old was too young to learn about the world's unfairness.

"No, you did well. Whatever you do, you must learn to succeed. When daddy goes to the city this time, I'll buy you books."

"It's okay. You've bought me many already. And actually, they didn't have much content anyway."

Vincent couldn't help but laugh at his son's bluff. He couldn't afford expensive practical books, so he bought books discarded by nobles at antique shops for cheap prices. Probably not books at a level the child could digest.

Vincent's heart was both moved and torn by his son, who worried about his parents' finances first.

"Right! By the way, how about it? Want to go cut trees with daddy? Learning is important, but a man must have physical strength. Today, daddy will teach you how to chop trees."

"Wow! Then you'll give me an axe too?"

"Heh heh! Of course! Today, let's cut down all the trees in the mountain with daddy!"

Vincent presented Shirone with an axe as if he had been waiting for this. It was expensive compared to their household finances, but much more useful than books. An axe could help earn money.

Honestly, he hoped his son would become a mountain man. But Shirone was small for his age and didn't seem capable of doing rough work. So he thought to build up his physical strength from now on.

'His face has noble bearing and his mind is exceptionally good. Could he have been a noble's child?'

Vincent hastily erased the doubt in his mind. Whenever he had such thoughts, he felt overwhelmed as if he had received a gift beyond his station, but was soon tormented by guilt.

'Shirone is my child. Not a child brought from the stable, but my child with my blood flowing through him.'

With such resolve, Vincent took Shirone's hand and left the house.

His logging area was one kilometer away from the cabin.

Since there were many mountain men in the vicinity, fights could break out if work was done outside designated areas. Sometimes it even led to bloodshed.

"Now. I'll show you how it's done, so watch carefully and follow along."

Vincent spat on his palms, then began chopping the tree with satisfaction. Not long after the thudding sounds began, the straight tree fell with a crack.

The number of axe strikes was a measure of a woodcutter's skill. Since Vincent wasn't a woodcutter, he felled it in ten strikes, but even that was considerable skill.

"Like this, you chop the same spot several times, then tilt the tree and it will fall under its own weight. Can you do it?"

"Yes, I'll try."

Vincent selected a tree that Shirone might be able to handle. Standing before the tree, Shirone spat on his hands just like his father had. Despite seeing it only once, his axe positioning, stance, and even the habit of rubbing his palms were identical.

Vincent smiled contentedly, thinking he was indeed clever.

But when he actually tried to swing the axe, his posture was somehow clumsy.

This wasn't something that could be done with just the head. Strength and stamina had to support it. The axe was considerably heavy, and strong muscle power was essential to swing it hard enough to cut through the air.

The reason Vincent had come out to cut trees was also because Shirone's build was small compared to his peers.

If he couldn't become a scholar by fate, he at least had to build strength. No woman would want to marry a man who couldn't earn money.

"Ugh! Ugh!"

Shirone gritted his teeth and swung the axe. But each time he swung, the impact points were all different.

Unable to watch anymore, Vincent gave him advice.

"You can't use all your strength. Instead of using a little less force, try to improve your accuracy."

Shirone quickly absorbed Vincent's advice. But this time, his strength was too weak and there was hardly any sign of it breaking.

Was our son really this weak?

Vincent became a little dejected.

"Phew, this is hard."

"It's okay, Shirone. No, I'm sorry. To be honest, I know this kind of work doesn't suit you. But a hunter's child, you see, inevitably..."

Vincent choked up with emotion. How must a parent feel when having to convey harsh reality to their child?

"You're really a clever child. Much smarter than Baron, the herbalist's son, and even Stella, the fruit vendor's daughter. You don't need to feel discouraged because you're weak. My greed has made you..."

With a heavy heart, tears welled up in Vincent's eyes. But Shirone paid no attention to such things and tugged at his father's collar, asking:

"More than that, daddy, how can I chop trees well?"

Vincent felt a bit embarrassed.

But the awkwardness was brief, and when Shirone showed interest in tree chopping, he felt elated.

"You, do you really want to learn this?"

"Yes, please teach me. It's fun."

His son's words gave him courage again. Vincent pulled himself together and took Shirone to examine the groove in the tree closely.

"Now, look at this groove here. Strength will come naturally when you become an adult. But actually, this isn't work that requires great strength. What's important is technique. I told you to hit the same spot earlier, but if you twist the angle just a little, it will receive much greater force."

"Ah, I see."

Vincent narrowed his eyes and stared intently at the groove his son had made. He was quite surprised. It was hard to think of him as a beginnerâ€”he had hit exactly the same spot with such precision.

At this rate, it would actually be difficult to fell the tree unless he was quite strong.
