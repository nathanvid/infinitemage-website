"I'll try again."

Even after Vincent stepped back, Shirone remained motionless for a long time, observing the groove in the tree.

He was currently feeling a light tremor.

Keeping a single piece of advice in one's head is knowledge. But accepting it with one's entire body is sensation.

Strike the same spot, but twist it just a little.

This simple knowledge, passed down through the mouths of countless people, was being absorbed by Shirone as an enlightenment far greater than Vincent had expected.

"Dad."

"Yeah?"

"Should I try breaking this in one go?"

"Hahaha! You haven't even cut halfway through, how could it break?"

"If I'm lucky, it might work."

Luck alone doesn't break trees. Experienced woodcutters persistently target the grain's weak points and fell trees with just a few axe strikes, but there was no way Shirone could do that.

"Alright! Let's trust our son's luck!"

Vincent readily played along with his son's whim. He was just grateful that Shirone was showing interest in wood cutting.

"If I break this, please grant me one wish."

"Huh? A wish?"

Suddenly, anxious thoughts crept in. What if he wanted to learn to read? Or what if he wanted to be sent to school like other wealthy children?

"Next time you go to the city to sell goods, please take me with you."

Honestly, it took ten years off his life, but Vincent didn't show it and laughed heartily.

"Hehe, if that's all, fine. I'll grant it gladly!"

Having received permission, Shirone pulled the axe back behind his shoulder and looked at the tree. Before long, the smile that had been lingering on his lips disappeared, and Vincent felt a chill. His son, who stared at the tree without even blinking, seemed to be searching for something invisible to the eye.

Shirone suddenly swung the axe. It appeared to strike the groove precisely, but mixed within a range imperceptible to human recognition was an extremely subtle twist.

CRACK!

At the sound like thunder striking, Vincent's eyes widened. Cracks spread like an earthquake from where the axe had entered, and the tree broke with a snap, unable to bear its own weight.

"Yahoo! Success!"

Vincent couldn't believe it. It was the legendary 'Thunder Strike' passed down among woodcutters. Neither Vincent nor any woodcutter he knew had ever seen or experienced this mythical technique—they had only heard of it.

But this was because woodcutters' work focused on making a living. In reality, certain professions encounter the Thunder Strike phenomenon quite frequently—namely, swordsmen.

Swordsmen who wield swords with their lives at stake train in systematic and profoundly deep techniques incomparable to woodcutters.

Thunder Strike was included among these techniques. But even for such swordsmen, it certainly wasn't a technique that could be performed easily.

"Yahoo! Success!"

Shirone, who could now go sightseeing in the city as promised, raised both arms and hopped around.

Vincent, watching this scene, was confused.

He couldn't decide whether he should raise this child as a woodcutter or whether he shouldn't raise him as a woodcutter.

* * *

Vincent held the reins of a two-horse carriage with a cargo cart attached as he passed through the gates of Creas city. Shirone, riding in the cargo compartment, looked around in all directions with sparkling eyes.

Leather would go to weapon shops, meat to grocery stores, and organs to apothecaries or magic item shops. He had to visit several shops, and with bargaining included, it would easily take four hours or more.

When they arrived at a shop, Shirone jumped down from the cart with a hop. Vincent shouldered a bag of meat and said:

"You need to be back before sunset."

"Don't worry. I've memorized all the roads."

"Never go into secluded places and only use the main roads. If anyone comes and asks why you're alone, point to the nearest shop and say you're waiting for your dad."

"Got it. Nothing happened when I came last time either."

Vincent's heart ached as if he were abandoning his son. But depending on how the bargaining went, his family's living expenses were at stake, so there was no choice.

Shirone reassured his worried father and left the shopping district. Vincent had expected the boy to visit performance venues or toy shops that children usually frequented, but Shirone had no interest in such things.

The place Shirone arrived at was the city's largest library. Looking up at the massive and magnificent building made his heart race.

Could all knowledge since the beginning of time be accumulated in this building?

There was no way to verify. The library, being the highest-grade cultural space, was impossible for anyone but nobility to enter.

When two female students emerged from the library carrying books in their arms, Shirone hastily stepped aside.

Vincent was a kind father, but whenever he talked about nobility, he would always threaten like a goblin.

Never talk back to them. Their words are always right. If you make eye contact, bow your head.

Shirone didn't care how great the nobility were. He simply wanted to read books.

'Why can't I enter?'

Shirone decided to follow the female students. Not only was there nowhere else he wanted to see besides the library, but he was curious about what made nobility different from commoners.

After walking for about 20 minutes, the scenery changed dramatically.

Shirone forgot his original purpose and was overwhelmed by the massive structures rising in all directions. Among them, the most impressive was undoubtedly a school that boasted an enormous campus, visible even beyond the iron bars.

The building's name was written on the arch of the main gate.

Alpheas Magic School.

If there was one word in the world that Shirone couldn't understand, it was magic.

It appeared without fail in countless stories, but he had never seen a book that described its principles. It was a kind of dismissal. It was also the arrogance that those who weren't mages didn't need to know.

A guard spotted Shirone and shouted:

"Hey! What are you doing, boy?"

And seeing Shirone's attire as unmistakably that of a lowborn, he waved his hand back and forth as if shooing away a fly.

"Get lost! This isn't a place for trash like you."

"Ah, I'm sorry."

Shirone fled in terror. When the fierce-looking guard even glared at him, his knees went weak.

But when the guard was no longer visible, he stopped walking again. Surprisingly, he was still beneath the walls of the magic school.

Just how vast was this school?

While thinking such thoughts, he heard an old man's voice from beyond the wall.

"Now then, let's discuss the topic of what magic is."

"Ahhh, no! Show us magic. Show us just one more!"

"Fire! Show us fire coming out, Headmaster!"

Shirone looked up at the large tree standing beyond the wall. It seemed the headmaster of the magic school was conducting an outdoor lesson under the tree's shade.

The children's voices were all younger than Shirone's. Since nobility received education from the moment they were born, it wasn't strange for young children to attend magic school.

"Hehehe, if I set fires at school, I'll get in trouble. Instead, if you answer a question correctly, I'll show you interesting magic."

"Awesome! What's the question? Ask it quickly!"

Shirone pressed his ear to the wall.

"What is the most necessary talent for learning magic?"

A long silence followed.

Everyone must have become speechless. Even to Shirone's thinking, it was a question requiring quite a subjective answer.

But these children were prodigies who had been admitted early for their recognized magical talent. Rather than giving up, they each offered their own answers.

"Effort. Magic can't be fully learned even with a lifetime of study, so effort is important."

"I think it's knowledge. I've read over 100 magic books myself."

Other plausible answers like concentration and memory followed.

But the headmaster's voice still couldn't be heard. He was probably smiling kindly while looking at the children.

"Money. You need to buy so much stuff to learn magic."

The children burst into laughter.

The headmaster's laughter was mixed in as well.

At this point, Shirone became curious too. If it wasn't effort, knowledge, or money, what was the most necessary talent for learning magic?

Having heard all the children's answers, the headmaster finally spoke.

"The most necessary talent for learning magic is insight."

A second silence arrived.

"What's insight?"

The headmaster made a troubled groaning sound, but soon continued his explanation in a kind voice.

"Insight is more accurate than knowledge and faster than effort."

"Wow! Then it's totally magic, isn't it?"

"Hehe! That could be so. No, that's right. All magic that exists in the world originates from insight. Let me give you an example. Do you know what 1 plus 1 equals?"

"Of course it's 2."

The children answered in unison. Their tone suggested how could such a thing even be asked.

"I see. Then can you explain why 1 plus 1 equals 2?"

"Huh? Well, of course..."

The children who had confidently started to speak closed their mouths. They couldn't grasp where to start explaining or what and how to explain it.

Laughter entered Alpheas's voice.

"That strange feeling you're experiencing right now is exactly insight. Long ago, there was a time when people didn't know that 1 plus 1 equals 2. They proved it through knowledge and effort. But you understand perfectly that 1 plus 1 equals 2 without going through such a process, don't you?"

Shirone gradually became absorbed in the story. The children beyond the wall must have been listening with their mouths agape as well.

"Magic is a phenomenon that has always existed. Just as the answer was 2 even when people didn't know that 1 plus 1 equals 2. Someone revealed that fact through effort and knowledge, but you don't need to do that. Thus, insight is the fastest means for understanding the rules of something."

"Then we don't need to study or make effort?"

"Does that make sense? But honestly speaking... that's actually true."

Common sense is knowledge believed by the majority. But sometimes things become common sense because they're convenient to accept. Shirone could guess Alpheas's heart having to tell this cruel reality.

"Then we don't need to attend school?"

"Hehehe! Insight isn't something that can be obtained so easily. The reason 1 plus 1 equals 2 is because scholars proved it over long years. Of course, there are people who realize the correct answer without going through the verification process. We call such people geniuses."

"My mom called me a genius!"

"That's not wrong either. Every human is born with talent, and if they polish that talent, anyone can become a genius."

Anyone can become a genius. Those words entered Shirone's heart and lodged there.

But was that really true? Would an opportunity to cross over this high wall ever come to him?

"Yes. You there, standing behind the wall. I'd like to hear what you think."

Shirone hastily stepped back from the wall.

Should he run away? No, should he answer? But did a commoner have the right to answer?

"Don't do that and come over here. I want to see your face."

Shirone approached the wall, hearing the sound of his heart beating. Though still young and unknowing of the world's ways, one thing was certain. If he didn't cross this wall now, he would regret it for life.

Shirone climbed over the wall. Alpheas, headmaster of Alpheas Magic School, was smiling.

His first impression was of a white-haired grandfather. But in reality, he was a certified 4th-rank mage recognized by the Kingdom, a person of high virtue whose name was known even in other countries.

Alpheas, sitting on a flat rock, waved his hand.

"Come here. Have you come to be this old man's conversation partner?"

Gaining confidence from Alpheas's kindness, Shirone jumped over the wall. As expected, children of similar age to Shirone or younger were sitting in a circle.
