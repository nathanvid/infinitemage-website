A child frowned upon seeing Shirone's appearance.

"Headmaster, he's not a noble. He looks like a commoner."

"Commoners aren't allowed in here. Hey, you get out quickly!"

Alpheas hadn't expected the boy not to be a noble either, so he scratched his eyebrows with a troubled expression. However, true to his nature as a mage who pursued knowledge, he gestured for Shirone to come over without discriminating based on social status.

"It's fine, come this way. So, what words from this old man captured your heart?"

Shirone stood there hesitating. He wanted to approach Alpheas, but the children's glares blocked his way.

They seemed to be saying: Don't dare invade their territory, you lowly commoner.

"Please show me magic."

"Hehe, have you never seen magic before?"

"I've read about it in books, but I've never seen it directly."

One child pointed at him and shouted.

"Liar! What books would a commoner read?"

Alpheas stared penetratingly into Shirone's eyes as if to discern the truth. It didn't seem to be a lie. But children of that age were also capable of deceiving adults with innocent faces as naturally as eating.

"Alright, what kind of magic would you like to see?"

"Anything is fine. Whatever it is, please show me. I beg you."

Shirone realized his situation and politely bowed his head. Alpheas chuckled heartily and waved his hand. If it was just magic to play around with the kids, it wasn't particularly difficult.

"This old man's only pleasure is showing magic to our little darlings. Good! Then this time I'll show you wind magic."

"Wow! Wind, it's wind!"

While the children clapped, Shirone was gripped by tension and clenched his fists tightly. Since he knew nothing about magic, it was only natural.

The moment Alpheas waved his hand, Shirone's eyes widened at the unexpected sensation of floating. The world sank down below as his field of vision opened up dramatically. He could see all the buildings of the magic school at once.

"Ahhhhh!"

Shirone screamed without realizing it. Meanwhile, the children were enjoying the magic, even performing aerial somersaults as they found Alpheas's magic entertaining.

Shortly after, Shirone plummeted at tremendous speed. Seeing the ground rushing toward him, he squeezed his eyes shut and curled up his body.

But the devastating impact never came. When he cautiously opened his eyes, he was floating gently near the ground.

The children pointed at Shirone and burst into laughter. Alpheas was also watching with a wrinkled smile.

"How was that? This is what we call magic."

All Shirone could hear was the sound of his heartbeat pounding in his chest. The magic he experienced for the first time in his life transcended the vague fantasies he had dreamed of as a boy.

"What is magic?"

"Hmm, let me see. Magic is..."

As Alpheas chose his words with a playful expression, the impatient Shirone added a comment.

"It's okay if I don't understand. Please tell me exactly what you think."

The children's faces hardened. Alpheas was a famous mage known throughout the Kingdom. That's why even noble children behaved like gentle lambs around him. But Shirone had spoken presumptuously, which was outrageous to the children.

Alpheas thought it was bold, but he wasn't displeased since he could sense desperation behind it. The boy's beautiful appearance, unbefitting of a commoner, also helped dispel the sense of incongruity.

"Hehe! No need to be so tense. It's actually not a difficult topic. But if you want, I'll raise the difficulty a little. Magic is the act of breaking common sense. Conversely, it's the mental process of exploring the truth of phenomena."

Shirone blinked and remained deep in thought for quite a while.

"You can say you don't know if you don't understand."

"It's different from common sense, but that's actually the truth?"

Alpheas pushed out his lower lip. It was a habit that only appeared when he was truly surprised.

Understanding the true meaning from brief words was only possible when one perfectly comprehended something.

Moreover, that was precisely the insight that Alpheas had emphasized.

"Where did you learn such things?"

"Uh, um, from books."

"Are there books with such content?"

"Not the content itself, but I thought of it while reading books. The idea that common sense isn't necessarily right. I also thought that to reach the truth, one must ultimately fight against common sense."

Alpheas nodded.

It was a reasonable statement.

'No, it's not just reasonable—it's truth. Does he really understand what he's saying? Anyone can recite what they've heard from someone else. But if that's not the case...'

Could he be twelve years old now?

Once an idea reaches the ranks of common sense, destroying it becomes extremely difficult. Realizing the essence—the primary goal pursued by magic—at such a young age showed considerable talent.

'Truly clever. No, he has insight. Is he really a commoner? What a shame.'

Shirone sensed he couldn't stay here long and asked his second question.

"How can one learn magic? Does it require special power?"

"I don't know what you mean by special power, but it does require considerable mental strength."

It was a surprisingly mundane answer. Shirone thought Alpheas might be hiding the truth.

"Is that really all there is? If I think about creating wind, can I fly in the sky like just now?"

"That's quite a difficult question. But to exaggerate, yes. Of course, thinking alone won't make it possible. A mage's mind must be perfectly synchronized with the world. Something like an extremely sensitive mental state, you could say."

The children, witnessing their headmaster seriously conversing with someone for the first time, didn't dare interrupt.

"How can one feel this extremely sensitive mental state?"

Alpheas grasped Shirone's intention and subtly smiled. It wasn't simple curiosity. This child was investigating. He truly intended to learn magic right here and now.

'Unfortunately, he's a commoner. He'll never have the chance to learn magic in his lifetime. It's better to give him the harsh reality now rather than let him taste lifelong frustration.'

Alpheas relaxed his expression as if to lighten the mood.

"When a mage concentrates, their mind becomes sensitive enough to perceive everything around them. Mages call this entering the Spirit Zone. I'll show you a demonstration, so watch what this child does. Shuamin, would you try entering the Spirit Zone?"

"Yes, Headmaster."

A girl named Shuamin answered confidently. Since all the children had been called geniuses before entering the school, it was natural they wanted to show off their skills.

When Shuamin closed her eyes and concentrated, the children automatically created a quiet atmosphere. As if such an attitude further revealed their superiority.

"I've entered the Spirit Zone."

"Then let's begin."

Alpheas took out coins and shook them. Then he caught the coins and extended his fist.

"Now, how many coins are in here?"

"Six."

When he opened his palm, six silver coins lay there. Ignoring Shirone's surprised expression, Alpheas repeated the same action.

"Now, try again."

"Three."

This was also correct.

Several more attempts followed, but the results were the same. Alpheas put away the coins with a satisfied expression and spoke.

"That's enough, Shuamin. You did very well."

Shuamin exhaled deeply. Though she had only guessed numbers correctly, cold sweat beaded on her forehead.

"This is what we call an extremely sensitive mental state. The moment a mage enters the Spirit Zone, they can perceive the external world with superhuman senses. Excellent mages can even count the number of leaves on distant trees. Of course, what Shuamin demonstrated is also impressive."

Shirone somehow felt he understood. He too had succeeded with Thunder Strike by using insight to realize an impossible point that human senses couldn't detect.

Thinking about it, Shuamin hadn't counted the coins. She had concentrated all her senses to feel the entire situation unfolding within Alpheas's hand.

'An extremely sensitive mental state. Spirit Zone.'

Shirone mulled over Alpheas's words. In the process, a natural question arose. Could he do it? Or maybe, perhaps he could?

"Anyone can do it."

Alpheas spoke, having read Shirone's inner thoughts.

Anyone could enter the Spirit Zone. But not just anyone could do it.

Innate talent.

Magic was such a world.

"Try practicing in a quiet place. First, feel yourself. Then erase that feeling. If you can do that, a world different from anything you've known will unfold. Do you understand what I mean?"

"I understand."

Shirone comprehended.

"If one cannot feel oneself, erasing oneself would also be impossible."

Alpheas was amazed once again. This wasn't insight that a twelve-year-old could appreciate.

Then there were two possibilities: he truly had talent, or some mischievous acquaintance had sent this child to play a prank.

"Would you like to try? Right here."

Having no reason to refuse, Shirone closed his eyes. He felt that somehow it would work if he applied his experience with Thunder Strike. But once he actually concentrated, it was different from finding a tree's weak point.

He couldn't visualize anything. Even if he recalled his appearance, most of it was merely composed of visual information. The fact that he knew almost nothing about himself was shocking.

'What exactly is it? The existence called me?'

Shirone delved endlessly into his thoughts. Finally, he reached the thought about himself who was thinking.

'Brain. Humans are brains.'

No matter what he recalled, no clear definition of himself emerged. Humans are merely the workings of the brain. If thinking is the only true self, then the moment thought is erased, the self also disappears.

Shirone began gradually erasing the brain's functions. It was something anyone could do, but not something just anyone could accomplish.

His mind seemed to be sucked into an abyss. It felt like seeing the form of concentration for the first time. As the nervous system connected to the five senses melted away, he could no longer distinguish what was smell and what was touch.

And finally, Shirone disappeared from his own brain.

Shirone's eyes snapped open.

The scene before him was peaceful. Children were yawning and girls were pulling each other's hair playfully. Shirone didn't realize that ten minutes had passed.

"How was it? Did you hear something?"

Alpheas didn't expect much. While he acknowledged the concentration that lasted ten minutes, the Spirit Zone wasn't something one could enter through effort alone. If standing with eyes closed was all it took, anyone could become a mage.

"Yes, I heard it."

At the unexpected answer, Alpheas raised an eyebrow.

"Oh? So, what did you hear?"

"Sounds. I heard all sounds."

"Hehe, is that so."

Alpheas nodded. Probably Shirone hadn't entered the Spirit Zone. Even ordinary people would hear all sorts of sounds if they concentrated for ten minutes. But what happened in the Spirit Zone was on a completely different dimension.

First, one experiences synesthesia. Sounds have smells, light has taste, and images are felt through the skin.

'As expected, it's too much to expect immediately? What a shame. He's a child with talent.'

If he had been a noble, if he had received training from childhood, wouldn't he have achieved similar accomplishments to the children here?

But that alone couldn't change Alpheas's mind. The world was full of talented people like stars. Even he couldn't guarantee that the children here would become mages.

"Well done. If you practice diligently in the future, you'll be able to hear even more sounds."

Alpheas patted Shirone and walked away with the children. Shirone knew of his disappointment. But not confirming whether he had left the school was consideration enough.

Shirone climbed over the wall. Then he ran like mad. Only after he stopped running and sat down did he notice his heart was pounding against his ribcage.

"It really worked."
