Shirone had heard every sound. Of course, there were senses beyond that, but he couldn't bring himself to confess them to Alpheas.

The moment his vague ideal became tangible, all his thoughts faced reality and sent a warning that this path was dangerous.

Perhaps he hadn't truly entered the Spirit Zone. He still couldn't define what it was.

It felt as if his body was breaking apart into particles and spreading outward. As his senses opened, all kinds of information came flooding in. He had trembled at the vastness of a world completely different from what he had perceived through his five senses. At the same time, one truth pierced through his mind.

I am infinite.

"Huk, huk."

Shirone shed tears of overwhelming emotion. He squeezed his eyes shut and ran. He didn't even realize he was running. His awakened brain secreted massive amounts of adrenaline, causing him to fall into a temporary blackout state.

Suddenly, a dull impact struck his face.

"Ow!"

Shirone grabbed his nose and fell on his backside. When he came to his senses, he was in an alley. It was the shady place Vincent had absolutely told him never to enter.

"What the hell, how annoying!"

The young man who had been knocked over by Shirone's back got angry as he fell. In front of them, rough-looking men glared at Shirone.

As the young man got up, he grabbed Shirone by the collar. He was a man with narrow, slit eyes and lips twisted in a vile manner.

"What? Are you crazy?"

"I'm, I'm sorry!"

"Sorry and that's it? Tell me honestly. The Wolf gang sent you, didn't they? You just tried to take me down, didn't you?"

"No! It's not like that!"

The thugs looked at Shirone's terrified eyes and smiled cruelly. This little kid who looked adorable even when fallen didn't have the courage to hurt a person, let alone wield a knife.

In the back alleys, they called this type "herbivores." And herbivores were good sources of funding for carnivores. He was trembling in fear, so now they just had to strip him clean.

'Ho? Look at this?'

Looking at his face, despite his shabby clothes, he had an air of nobility about him. This kind of child was premium merchandise that could fetch a gold coin if sold to the southern district.

"What are you guys doing? Did something interesting happen?"

"Miss Amy!"

All the thugs turned around shouting in unison.

At the mouth of the alley stood a pretty girl about Shirone's age. Her reddish bangs flowed down to cover one eye, and she wore a dress with a collar as high as her long neck.

"Hehe. What brings you here? Bored again?"

Despite his casual tone, the young man rubbed his hands together obsequiously. Anyone who knew her identity would act the same way.

Carmis Amy.

The youngest daughter of the Carmis family, first-rank nobility. Born with everything, she felt fed up with life, and these days her only pleasure was lurking around back alleys looking for interesting things.

First-rank nobility was just below royalty in the hierarchy, so it was natural for back-alley thugs to tremble. Moreover, Amy was generous with her spending, earning even the respect of the street punks.

"This bastard here was trying to kill someone. So we were about to teach him a lesson."

Shirone frantically shook his head.

"N-no. I bumped into him without realizing it."

"He's lying. You expect us to believe that?"

When a burly man struck his abdomen, Shirone couldn't even scream and rolled on the ground. His breath stopped and his stomach felt like it was tearing apart. It was his first experience with violence in his life.

"You should pay compensation, you bastard! Where's your mother? Bring the mother who gave birth to a conscienceless bastard like you and is probably just stuffing her face!"

Shirone was shocked. How could they say such things when they had mothers too? They really were bad people.

"Oh? This bastard's eyes are changing? Are you upset?"

When Shirone's expression hardened, the thugs all rushed in and began trampling him. Even then, Shirone didn't understand why they weren't touching his face.

"Stop it. You'll kill the kid at this rate."

At Amy's command, the thugs backed off.

Shirone looked at her with terrified eyes. She seemed free from pain, as if there was an invisible glass wall between them, and he envied her.

"Hey! Are you okay?"

"I, I didn't do anything wrong."

"Who said you did? I asked if you were okay."

"I don't know if I'm okay or not."

Shirone wanted to go home. Maybe this girl would let him go. Women didn't like hurting people, did they? He could only hope for her permission.

Amy turned to the thugs and said,

"So what now? Nothing more interesting?"

Shirone looked at Amy with eyes full of betrayal and fear. But she just smiled mischievously like a prankster. One of the thugs scratched his head and said,

"We were planning to shake him down a bit then sell him to a male brothel."

Shirone's face turned as pale as watery soup. Seeing the terrified boy's face, Amy felt a little sorry for him.

But she had no intention of playing the same games as back-alley trash. She planned to scare him a little then send him home.

"For a male prostitute, there can't be any defects. How about we strip him to check?"

Amy made a bold suggestion. Nobles matured earlier than commoners, so at twelve years old, she was well-versed in theory.

Her curiosity was equally strong, and she had been thinking she'd like to see for herself at least once.

'Besides... he's handsome, isn't he? Honestly.'

The rough, naked bodies of adults were something she'd refuse even if paid. Fortunately, Shirone was around her age and looked appealing. While commoner women might prefer burly, sturdy men, nobles preferred faces like Shirone's.

"Strip once. Who knows? If you do as you're told diligently, maybe we'll send you home."

Shirone was dazed under countless stares. He couldn't understand why he had to be treated this way.

"Hey, the lady told you to strip! Want to get beaten again?"

A thug barked, but Shirone showed no reaction.

Amy felt slightly uneasy. While noble twelve-year-olds were considered grown-up, commoners were still children. His mind might have snapped from fear that exceeded his limits.

But Shirone hadn't gone insane. Rather, he was more focused than ever. Falling into panic, he had unknowingly entered the Spirit Zone.

His second experience with the Spirit Zone was different from the first. All kinds of information swirled around him. He could almost hear the sound of the thugs blinking their eyes.

In the ultra-sensory mental world, Shirone followed the only path available, letting his consciousness flow along it. At the destination of that path lay memories of Alpheas casting magic.

Shirone's insight gathered all the surface information from when Alpheas cast magic - his emotions, senses, mentality, actions, attitude, posture, and more.

As the external form took shape, he could roughly predict the inner truth, and some concept rolled into his mind with a click.

"You bastard! Why aren't you pulling down your pants? The lady wants to see!"

The Spirit Zone, which required intense concentration, was vulnerable to physical shock. Shirone too almost fell out of the Spirit Zone when the thug grabbed his collar and shook him.

As an eerie energy rose in Shirone's eyes, Amy reached out and shouted,

"Wait a moment!"

But the situation was already beyond control.

Shirone's mind, precariously balanced on the boundary between reality and the Spirit Zone, recognized the crisis, and instinctively some will twisted the phenomenon.

Whoosh!

High-density wind erupted, lifting everything in the alley. Not only the thugs but even Amy were blown away.

As if a typhoon had swept through, not a wooden box, not a stone, not even a speck of dust remained.

"Aaaaah! Help!"

Hearing the screams from the sky, Shirone snapped out of the zone. When he came to his senses, he saw the desolately empty alley.

Soon after, the people who had been lifted higher than the building rooftops began falling with terrible shrieks.

Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!

Heavy sounds that promised impact just from hearing them pounded the ground. Gravity was a much more powerful force than common sense suggested, and the limbs of the thugs who fell arms and legs first were broken and twisted.

"Aaaaargh."

"My, my arm. My leg...!"

Their legs were grotesquely bent, and the bones of their forearms protruded through the skin by a span. It looked like discarded wooden dolls carelessly scattered about.

Shirone, who hadn't expected that a moment's emotion could produce such devastating results, was speechless.

At that moment, there was one person who landed on the ground in perfect condition - Amy.

Nobles trained their bodies systematically from childhood. Especially for first-rank nobility, this went without saying.

Amy, who came down holding her fluttering skirt, looked at Shirone with an astonished expression.

"You... what exactly are you?"

The scene Shirone had created clearly showed why mages were fearsome beings. Even she, who prided herself on natural athletic ability, couldn't resist the sudden whirlwind.

"Answer me! Where did you learn magic? How could a commoner...!"

Amy stopped speaking and turned around. People were gathering after hearing the screams. If rumors spread that she had been associating with thugs, there would be chaos in her family.

"Tch!"

Amy placed one foot against a building. Kicking off the wall and leaping up, she pushed off the wall surface with both feet again and disappeared over the roof of the opposite building.

"Huh? Huh?"

Shirone, who had been following her zigzag movement, didn't know what to do when she disappeared. If people saw this scene, he would be blamed for everything. Cities were cruel places for the powerless, and no one would take his side.

Shirone ran to the opposite alley. He moved his legs frantically, seeking the only person he could trust and rely on - his father.

* * *

The Carmis family.

A powerhouse of the kingdom that had maintained first-rank status for 200 years.

While the main house was here in Creas, the talents produced by the family were making outstanding achievements not just in the kingdom but across the continent.

Amy opened the door with a tired expression. Her father, Carmis Shacola, who had retired from politics and returned to the main house, was reading a newspaper.

"I'm back."

"Where have you been? Skipping education again?"

Though Shacola was past sixty, he was young enough to have no white hair. Tall with a lean physique and an intellectual face. His eyes held the pride of being the kingdom's highest nobility.

"I've learned everything there is to learn. It's boring too."

"So you went and played with ruffians? No matter how much of a genius you are, if you just play around carelessly, you'll be overtaken. Even raw gems must be polished to become jewels. If you let your guard down, someday you'll get hit from behind."

"Ugh! That nagging again."

Shacola chuckled. While her reckless nature was exactly like her mother's, her talent inherited his blood directly. Once she realized what she possessed, the tilted axis would naturally find its place.

That was the fate of a genius, after all.

Amy was about to enter her room when she stopped abruptly. Thanks to her father's nagging, the day's events she didn't want to think about came to mind.

'What exactly was that kid?'

Whether by his appearance or his terrified demeanor, he was definitely a commoner. The possibility of a non-noble learning magic formally was less likely than an illiterate person mastering imperial theory.

Then what was the magic he had cast in the alley?

Accidental manifestation? Awakening of talent? No matter how much she thought about it, that was the only explanation that came to mind. Her father's words stung anew.

-If you let your guard down, someday you'll get hit from behind.

Amy chewed her lips thoughtfully. While it was true that the world was boring, she had absolutely no intention of falling behind others.

"Dad."

Shacola put down his newspaper and adjusted his glasses. It was unexpected for his daughter, whom he thought was going through puberty, to speak to him first.

"Yes. Do you have something to say?"

"Well... it's not that I particularly want to do it. There's just a field I'm interested in."

"Oh?"

Shacola's eyes lit up with interest. She had been a child who could grasp a hundred things when taught one since childhood, so she would do well at whatever she pursued.

"Tell me. Dad will actively support you."

"No, it's not that I want to do it, I'm really just interested."

"I see. Then I'll actively support that interest of yours."

Amy smacked her lips. She actually knew the truth. With the power and wealth of first-rank nobility, there was nothing in the world they couldn't obtain.

Sometimes wanting to see parents struggle for their daughter's sake was nothing more than a teenage girl's whim.

"Magic."

"Hm? What did you say?"

"If you know anyone at a magic school, please introduce me."
