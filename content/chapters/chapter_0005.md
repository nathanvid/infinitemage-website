Shirone kept silent about what had happened in the city. When he thought about it, it wasn't a simple matter. Once he started talking, he would have to tell them everything that happened at the magic school.

Shirone had an inkling of how extraordinary that day's experience had been. Whether it was a blessing or a curse, he didn't know, but one thing was certain—having crossed that line, there was no going back to how things were before.

One of the criteria for being a genius is knowing that you are one. Shirone had also realized from a young age that he was different from others. While he didn't feel particularly superior, his desire to test the limits of his abilities was stronger than anyone else's.

He simply didn't show it.

To Shirone, his parents were the most precious people in the world. Even though they were poor, they had never once forced him down the wrong path, and he didn't want to burden their hearts.

The great awakening experienced by the 12-year-old boy thus entered a dormant phase, waiting for the right opportunity.

Life continued as usual. He helped his mother with work and went to the mountain in the afternoon to cut wood.

However, most of his time on the mountain was spent in meditation rather than chopping wood. After about a month, his speed of entering the Spirit Zone had improved dramatically.

Of course, some things weren't as easy as he'd hoped. No matter how accustomed he became to the Spirit Zone, the magic he had cast in the alley never activated again.

Before long, Shirone realized why.

It had been magic cast involuntarily and unconsciously. Once he became conscious of success, imitation became impossible. It was the same principle as when you become conscious of sheet music you played thoughtlessly—your hands freeze up.

To restore that sensation, he would have to carefully retrace the intermediate steps that he had skipped through insight, but it was impossible for him to examine the process without having learned magic.

Shirone quickly abandoned what he couldn't obtain and instead relentlessly delved into the Spirit Zone.

Simply casting magic would limit him to being a magic researcher at best. He concluded that mental endurance that wouldn't waver under any circumstances was important.

After finishing five hours of meditation, Shirone picked up his axe and attempted Thunder Strike. Unlike before, once he began to be conscious of Thunder Strike, his success rate dropped. However, wood chopping was different from magic—he could review the process as much as he wanted.

Shirone swung his axe while correcting errors one by one.

After hundreds of swings, Thunder Strike succeeded.

Crack-crack-crack!

The tree fell satisfyingly.

But he felt no particular excitement. He had simply discovered and corrected one error.

"Tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow."

He would continue building these fundamentals. For the opportunity that would someday come.

The light in Shirone's eyes as he carried the wood home was shining more intensely than ever.

**An Opportunity Worth More Than Life (1)**

Fallen leaves danced endlessly on the wind.

Standing by the window, Shirone wore a marten fur scarf and gazed at the late autumn mountain scenery.

Four years had passed, and Shirone had now grown into a 16-year-old young man. Though he still showed traces of youth, his face was so remarkably beautiful that anyone, regardless of age or gender, would turn to look.

"I'm going out, Mom."

"Take it easy and come back. We have enough firewood now."

"Winter's coming soon. We need to prepare in advance."

After gathering his equipment and leaving the cabin, the cold air took his breath away. Since seasons arrived earlier on the mountain than in the city, snow was already piled up on the peak.

"I'll need to walk briskly to get back before sunset."

Having trained his mind with the Spirit Zone for four years, Shirone no longer feared ordinary dangers as he once had. Thanks to this, his shyness had also disappeared, and he often mingled with the mountain children.

However, he had no friends with whom he was completely open.

The mountain children were different from Shirone—their personalities were rough and straightforward. Even the girls were like that.

In such a group, Shirone was an ugly duckling.

The children admired Shirone's intellectual beauty while sometimes showing outright hostility toward him.

A year ago, a woman named Hauran from the slash-and-burn village had made advances toward Shirone. Six years his senior, she had called him over saying she had something to tell him and tried to make physical advances.

But when Shirone firmly refused, she suddenly changed her tune, saying that weak men like him weren't her type and threatened that if he ever bothered her again, she would turn his household upside down.

Shirone let out a chuckle as he recalled that incident.

He remembered how he had agonized for days in his young heart, truly worried that she might come looking for him.

'I wonder how everyone is doing?'

Arriving at the logging area, Shirone found a suitable tree and lightly struck it with his axe, carefully examining the groove that formed.

But his eyes weren't really seeing anything. Years of experience had taught him that a tree's weak points couldn't be found with the eyes.

When you repeat the same action or thought, there are cases where you naturally come to understand its principle—this is called routine. A typical example would be naturally understanding the complex concepts of arithmetic operations.

For four years, Shirone had tried chopping wood in various ways, and through that process, he had perfected the sensation of Thunder Strike.

Sensing something, Shirone picked up his axe again and struck the tree's groove with moderate force. Thunder sounded as the tree fell. Success with just two axe strikes. It was lucky, but Shirone succeeded with Thunder Strike one time out of ten anyway.

Sitting on the fallen tree, Shirone entered the Spirit Zone. The current form of his Spirit Zone was roughly a sphere with a 40-meter diameter. This was a level that would place him in the upper class even at a magic school filled with talented individuals.

Shirone felt the world beneath his feet. As if he had become one with the earth, he could feel the rustling of the undergrowth. He could hear earthworms wriggling in the soil and tree roots absorbing moisture.

Nature never stops changing. When savoring that dynamic world, five hours passed in an instant.

"Huh? It's already gotten dark."

Having finished his meditation, Shirone chopped the fallen tree into logs and loaded them onto his A-frame carrier.

Arriving at the cabin, Shirone noticed an expensive carriage that he couldn't normally see parked there. Looking at the stable, he saw two white horses licking their feed.

"I'm back."

He opened the door and greeted them, but no welcoming voice could be heard. The atmosphere was strange. His mother's face was dark, and in the living room sat an unfamiliar old man at the table, having a conversation with his father.

"Huh? Dad, you're back?"

"Did you come back, Shirone?"

For having entered the city at dawn, he had returned quite early. Moreover, at any other time he would have run over and showered him with kisses, but now he was solemnly keeping his position.

"Pay your respects, Shirone. This is the deputy butler of the Ozent family."

"How do you do. I'm Temuran."

"It's my first time meeting you. My name is Shirone."

Shirone bowed politely. Even Shirone, who lived in this mountain valley, knew of the Ozent family. They were second-rank nobles with their main house in Creas, a martial family that had produced numerous warriors.

"I came here to meet you."

Temuran carried the distinctive scent of nobility. That didn't mean he was a noble himself.

The Kingdom's class structure was simple with nobles and commoners, but apart from political distinctions, various classes existed.

Among these, the commoner classes could be said to be determined by the nobles.

A blacksmith who makes swords for nobles receives respect. Merchants who set up shops in noble districts also wield tremendous authority.

What about mountain people then? They had no connection to nobles whatsoever and didn't even live in the city.

Therefore, mountain people were called lowborn and looked down upon.

In contrast, Temuran had a job assisting nobles directly, so he could be considered the highest among commoners.

Shirone didn't understand why such a person would come all the way to this mountain valley looking for him.

"Let me have a look first."

Temuran examined Shirone's body, feeling his appearance, bone structure, and eyes. It was the attitude of grading livestock.

"I hear you can read."

"Yes. I've been reading books little by little since I was young."

Without providing any explanation, Temuran fell into thought. Then Shirone's patience reached its limit.

"I'd like to know what this is about. Could you please tell me?"

Temuran's eyes turned sharp.

"Your reputation is quite good. A mountain person's child who can read, and moreover, they say your filial piety runs that deep?"

Temuran had the ability to make praise sound like mockery. It was as if he was saying, "How deep could your filial piety possibly be?"

Shirone hated people who disparaged other families most of all. Just as he was about to retort, unable to bear it, unbelievable words spilled from Temuran's mouth.

"How would you like to work for the Ozent family?"

Lightning struck inside Shirone's head. Working for a second-rank noble family was tantamount to rising from the lowest to the highest class.

"What kind of work would I be doing?"

"The main house is undertaking a library relocation project. It's not work that can be entrusted to just anyone. Among the ten thousand books, there are some that must not be leaked. Laborers will do the heavy work, but only you and I will handle the classification work together. It will take about two years."

A library!

Shirone's heart nearly burst. He knew that the more attractive a proposal was, the more likely it was to hide poison, but right now he felt like he would drink any poisoned cup.

Temuran told him what poison Shirone would have to drink. It was the butler's pride in not deceiving lowborn people.

"The only people who know about this are you and your family. For any reason whatsoever, if books are leaked or rumors of leakage spread, you and your family are dead."

Shirone realized why his parents' expressions had been dark. Even if he promised not to reveal anything, who knew what might happen over two years? It was like entrusting their lives to someone else.

Yet the reason he couldn't refuse the proposal was probably...

"Since it's work that risks your life, I'll pay you enough money. It will be much more than what your father earns from hunting. Thanks to having such a fine son, the family will prosper."

Vincent stood up abruptly with a reddened face.

"We didn't listen to your story for money! I just want our Shirone... Shirone to..."

Vincent was choked up with grief. He had been a pathetic father who had given his son nothing. And now the opportunity he had brought required risking his son's life.

"...be able to fulfill his dreams."

Temuran snorted as if it was absurd.

"What are you thinking right now? Are you planning to flatter your way to success? If so, wake up from that dream. Let me be clear—I'm hiring you. It was you who asked me to use your son. There would be no reason to do so if not for money."

"I said he could read!"

"Of course he can read. But the point isn't that he should read—it's that perfect surveillance is impossible. That's why I said I'd cut off his head if there's a leak. It's the minimum safety measure."

Vincent ground his teeth. When he had gone to the city to sell goods, he heard that a noble family's butler was looking for commoners who could read. Thinking it was a heaven-sent opportunity, he had rushed to Temuran without hesitation, begging him to hire Shirone.

But to come out with this kind of attitude.

What he feared most was the hurt his son would receive. Surely he wouldn't think that his father had sold him out of greed for money?

If that were the case, it would be horrific just to imagine.

"Get out. I don't need a single penny. If I had known it would be like this, I wouldn't have begged in the first place. So get out of this house right now!"

"Dad, I'll do it."

"Shirone!"

Temuran looked back at Shirone with a surprised expression. It was work that required risking one's life. For a 16-year-old boy—and a lowborn one at that—it would be an enormous burden to bear, yet Shirone showed not the slightest sign of fear.

"Are you really okay with this? I'm not trying to scare you. But let me be clear—if even the smallest rumor spreads, your head will be cut off."

"Yes, I'll do it. I will absolutely not cause any leaks, and even if rumors spread for any reason, I won't hold any resentment. Please let me do it."

If he said that much, Temuran could trust him. All conditions were perfect. He was lowborn who could be killed at any time, had deep filial piety, and possessed intelligence as well.

Feeling that his efforts had paid off, Temuran turned his body.

"I'll come to pick you up in a week. If you change your mind during that time, you can refuse anytime. However, keep in mind that once you enter the mansion, you won't be able to leave until the work is finished."

As if he wanted no one's farewell, Temuran opened the door alone and left. But the family wasn't in the mood to politely see him off either.
