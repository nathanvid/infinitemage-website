Vincent grabbed Shirone's shoulders and shouted.

"Shirone! Why did you accept it? This is really dangerous! No, it's my fault! Your father is ignorant, that's why! So let's refuse!"

"It's okay, Dad. I just need to make sure nothing gets leaked."

"It's not that simple. How can there be secrets in what people do? No matter how I think about it, this was crazy! I'll take responsibility and refuse!"

Shirone smiled gently and slowly shook his head. I really did meet wonderful parents.

"Father, thank you."

Vincent's face went blank. It was the first time Shirone had addressed him with such formal respect as "Father." But what was even more surprising was that Shirone was shedding tears.

"Shi... Shirone..."

Shirone spread his arms wide. Then, with a smile as radiant as his joy, he said:

"Father has given me the greatest gift in the world."

"Huk!"

Vincent forgot all about dignity and burst into tears. Had he ever seen his son cry in all his life? No, had he ever seen such an expression filled with pure joy?

"Don't worry, Shirone! No matter what happens, your father will protect you! You don't need to worry about anything, just work hard! I'll definitely protect you!"

"Dad, I'll work hard."

"Yes, my son! My treasure!"

Vincent pulled Shirone into an embrace and kissed his cheek. At this touching embrace between father and son, Olina wiped away tears of happiness.

One week later.

The servants from the Ozent household came to fetch Shirone. Though they said organizing ten thousand books would easily take over two years, Shirone's belongings from his simple mountain life amounted to just a single backpack.

Temuran had promised twenty gold per month as the condition for taking Shirone. Since the family's monthly living expenses were four gold, it was an enormous sum.

When he returned, would this house have changed to be a little more luxurious? Though he knew his parents weren't that type, Shirone deliberately entertained pleasant thoughts to shake off his regret.

From the moment he boarded the carriage, the contract would take effect.

The servants efficiently processed the contract, and the flustered Vincent had to put Shirone in the carriage without having enough time for a proper farewell.

Waiting in the carriage, Shirone was calm. Though he hadn't shown it to his parents, from now on it would be important to cool his head with rationality rather than emotion.

Closing his eyes and entering his zone, he sensed through synesthesia his parents wiping away tears as they waited for departure. Shirone moved his thoughts as if caressing their hearts.

A warm feeling of comfort seeped into Vincent and Olina's hearts. Though it wasn't something that could be called magic, it was certain that Shirone's sincere heart had reached them.

When the carriage jolted, Shirone was ejected from his Spirit Zone. But his eyes remained closed.

Entering the Ozent household was a double-edged sword that could be both the opportunity of a lifetime and the worst crisis.

Could he survive two years among people with such powerful authority?

Entrusting himself to an unknowable future, Shirone fell back into his Spirit Zone.

* * *

The Ozent household was a renowned military family that had produced a general-level, nationally certified 3rd-rank swordsman. Moreover, the family head, Ozent Bishop, was a nationally certified 4th-rank swordsman serving as the military commander of Creas city.

Arriving at the Ozent household, Shirone was overwhelmed by the vast landscape that spread beyond the main gate.

A massive road cut straight through the entire grounds. The road passed through the overwhelmingly large mansion, went through an arch, and extended to the back gate before stretching on to distant places invisible to the eye.

'This is the great straight road of the Ozent household I've only heard about.'

This straight road that boldly bisected the grounds was a symbol that spoke to the bold temperament of the Ozent family.

A servant in his early twenties looked at Shirone and sneered.

"Hehe, scared already? No need to be surprised yet. The family members are even more monstrous."

"Watch your mouth. Want to lose your head?"

An older butler gave a warning. But since there was no particular malicious intent, he stopped the interrogation and led Shirone through the main gate.

The great straight road wasn't for servants. Shirone followed the garden path alongside the road, going around the mansion.

The servants' quarters were in a four-story circular building. Going up to the office, Assistant Butler Temuran was working.

"You're here? I'll explain the work, so follow me."

"Yes, I'll work hard."

Without even acknowledging the greeting, Temuran headed toward the library.

The library's iron door opened with a creaking sound, revealing a space filled with books. The second floor, third floor, and fourth floor contained nothing but books.

Breathing in the scent of old paper, Shirone clenched his fists. This was definitely worth risking his life for.

"You'll be moving these books to the new library. Your job is book classification. I'll give you a list every week, so you find and gather those books. Work hours are 9 AM to 6 PM. After that is your free time. You cannot leave the grounds, and you must not enter the mansion without special orders. The servant rules will be explained by the other servants. Do you understand?"

"Yes. When should I start?"

"Tomorrow. Today, unpack and rest. Meanwhile, familiarize yourself with the servant rules."

From the next day, Shirone began working at the library. Once he actually started the work, he realized why this job could only be done alone.

The documents Temuran handed him contained hundreds of titles, but the classification criteria were subjective.

For example, it was ambiguous whether a book called "History of Swordsmanship" should be classified as a history book or a swordsmanship manual.

Though Temuran had established a basic system, dividing ten thousand books often required subjective judgment.

Shirone decided to establish priorities. Since history was comprehensive and swordsmanship was specialized, "History of Swordsmanship" would be classified as a swordsmanship manual. It took a full two weeks just to establish such criteria.

But even this work was beneficial for Shirone.

What he realized in the process of creating the classification system was that all knowledge is interconnected. Music and mathematics, chemistry and spirit, art and science were not different.

After the classification system was established, the work gained momentum. Once he could meet the target quantity within the allotted time, he finally turned his attention to studying.

Knowledge was the greatest criterion dividing nobles from commoners. The knowledge he would gain here would be tremendously helpful in the future.

Shirone decided to use his time efficiently. Ten thousand books lay before him. Even with two years, it would be impossible to read every book.

'Where should I start? Should I just read randomly?'

A good idea occurred to him and Shirone slapped his knee. Since all knowledge is interconnected, if he delved deep into one discipline, he could supplement other knowledge later.

"Then what field should I delve into?"

After much thought, the corners of Shirone's mouth lifted.

"I'll study history."

If human life is history, then knowledge has also developed following history. Learning history first was like establishing the spine of a living being.

Shirone drew a horizontal line of history in his mind. If that line were expanded, it would contain all of humanity's knowledge—religion, science, magic, mythology, literature, art, politics, war, economics—arranged chronologically.

"If I learn history, I can supplement other knowledge at any time. No, I can combine them much faster. History is the spine of knowledge."

There were approximately 850 history books stored in the great library. Shirone made his decision. During these two years, he would read all 850 of these books. He would establish the spine of knowledge!

From that day forward, Shirone didn't return to his quarters even after work ended, but continued reading.

He skipped roll call under the pretext of working overtime, but except for Temuran, no one cared about Shirone, who was temporary help.

Reading history books was honestly grueling. Having grown up in the mountains for sixteen years, he had no way to visualize the continental place names, people, and events he'd never heard of.

He considered memorizing everything wholesale, but soon shook his head. Memorization is recorded in the head, but understanding is recorded in the heart. Understanding even one line of events before moving on was the royal road to establishing the spine of knowledge.

Nevertheless, understanding history was hard labor.

It wasn't enough to just know the events—he had to carefully examine why such events inevitably occurred and how these events would influence future events.

Efficiency dropped markedly, and after a week he could barely finish a single book. He frequently slept in the library, often collapsing as if fainting.

4 AM.

The iron door opened, and Temuran entered carrying a crystal lamp. Though Shirone didn't notice, Temuran came at this time every day to monitor him.

He examined the book Shirone had dropped while reading. Despite the content not being particularly difficult, the same book had remained unchanged for two weeks.

Temuran snorted with derision. If he had been frantically studying practical books, Temuran would have considered forbidding access outside work hours.

But looking at this now, he was completely hopeless. He was a fool who dreamed impossible dreams just because he could read a little.

"Of course. What kind of success could lowborn trash achieve?"

With a much lighter heart, Temuran turned away. To succeed through study required not only luck but intelligence to back it up. He already thought Shirone, with his grandiose dreams alone, was hopeless.

* * *

Three months had passed since beginning the library work.

As the classification work became routine, his time management became much more relaxed, and he learned various things through the other servants.

The most shocking fact among them was that the nobles didn't care whether books were leaked or not.

Anyway, the family's secret techniques were only passed down directly, and nobles who had so much to do didn't care if a few books disappeared.

This didn't make Shirone any less dangerous though. The generosity of nobles was built upon the rigid loyalty of commoners. The servants could become ruthlessly cold to prevent even the slightest mistake.

The fact that what was trivial to nobles was something commoners had to risk their lives for made Shirone feel in his bones how far apart the mindsets of the two classes were.

When the sun was high in the sky, the library door suddenly burst open and a boy's voice he'd never heard before shattered the silence.

"Phew, damn old geezer. Would it kill him to let me rest on a day like this?"

Shirone blinked at the uninvited guest.

It was Ozent Rian, the family head's youngest son. True to his warrior bloodline, he was a handsome young man with strong facial features, and though the same age, he was a head taller than Shirone.

A thunderous shout came from outside the library.

"Rian! How dare you run away? If I catch you, that's a hundred extra laps around the garden!"

"Aaah! Damn it!"

Rian ran around frantically between the bookshelves before spotting Shirone. Without giving him time to react, he rushed over, shook Shirone and shouted:

"Hey! Don't tell them I came here. Got it?"

As soon as he spoke, Rian hid under the bookshelf. At the same time, the door opened and an old man's roar shook the library.

"Riaan! I know you're hiding here!"

Though a white-haired old man, his shoulders were broad and he was as tall as a giant. With his white beard grown down to his solar plexus, he approached Shirone with fierce eyes.

"You! Did a blue-haired peanut-sized kid come in here?"

Shirone thought about whether he knew such a person. He knew a blue-haired boy, but if that was peanut-sized, how did he look in the old man's eyes?

"From the description, it sounds like the youngest master. Excuse me, but who might you be?"

Shirone thought to try buying time using the family's authority. But the veteran warrior who had commanded battlefields for decades saw through Shirone's psychology.

"I'm the swordsmanship instructor! The teacher who can beat up that peanut! Stop the nonsense and speak quickly. Unless you want to get beaten up first."

Shirone clicked his tongue. To one who thirsted for learning, a teacher was like heaven itself. Especially someone teaching under the family head's orders—a servant's word games wouldn't work on such a person.

"Ah, I see. If you mean the young master, he's hiding under that bookshelf over there."

"Hey! Are you crazy? Want to die?"

Rian crawled out with a scowl. Then he spotted the swordsmanship instructor who had approached right in front of him and trembled like a leaf.

"Master, this is a misunderstanding!"

"You braaat!"

The swordsmanship instructor grabbed Rian by the collar and slammed him to the ground.

The moment Rian's body traced an arc through the air, Shirone closed one eye. Rian hit the floor with a tremendous sound and lay sprawled, limbs twitching.

"Follow me, you little brat. You need to rebuild your mental discipline before training or anything else."

Being dragged away by his leg, Rian craned his neck toward Shirone. Then he mouthed something silently.

Though no voice came out and he only moved his lips, Shirone could hear his voice clearly.

You're dead.
