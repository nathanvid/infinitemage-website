Since that day, the back of Shirone's head had been itching with anxiety. He never knew when Rian might come back for revenge.

But he didn't appear. According to rumors, he had been caught by the swordsmanship instructor and dragged off to the mountains.

Only after a month had passed could Shirone finally breathe a sigh of relief. Emotions are highly volatile—given enough time, even major incidents start to feel like nothing much. Even if Rian returned, he probably wouldn't be as angry as before.

With his mind at ease, Shirone read about the founding history of his homeland, the Kingdom of Tormia.

In four months, he had devoured 82 books. It wasn't a huge number, but considering it had taken him 20 days to finish his first book, it was remarkable progress.

Recently, Shirone's reading speed had increased exponentially, taking him an average of only 20 seconds to read a single page.

Unknown sections might take a full minute, but familiar parts took less than 10 seconds.

This was a natural phenomenon that occurred when studying one field intensively. Since authors also gained their knowledge from other books, no text was ever completely new content.

If he could just surpass the critical threshold of about 200 books—the turning point for grasping overall content—the remaining 650 books could probably be completed at an incomparably faster pace than before.

Shirone's favorite parts in history books were the exploits of mages. While scholars were people who researched theories, mages were the ones who made those theories into reality.

That's why mages had as many different professions as there were types of academic disciplines. On the other hand, scholars who couldn't enter the Spirit Zone couldn't become mages, making mages truly valuable high-level talent.

Vast knowledge and keen senses.

These two things were the essential conditions a mage had to possess. Having already mastered the Spirit Zone, Shirone devoted himself even more to filling his mind with knowledge.

He suppressed his curiosity about miscellaneous subjects and studied only history. This was for the sake of the limitless efficiency he would gain once the backbone of his knowledge was complete.

When that efficiency finally bore fruit, what kind of mage would he have become?

With such imagination, even sleeping felt like a waste of time.

As Shirone finished the last page of the founding history and was about to close the book with a satisfied expression, he heard the sound of a door being roughly thrown open.

"You bastard! I've been enduring hell just waiting for this day to come!"

According to the person in question, it was Ozent Rian, returned from hell. His face, filled with venom, looked like the very incarnation of a demon.

Shirone clicked his tongue at his persistence. Somehow, the same fury from when he'd been dragged away by the swordsmanship instructor was still being transmitted.

The only changes were the dark circles under his eyes and his gaunt frame.

"You! You dared to tattle on my hiding place, didn't you?"

"You really came here because of that?"

"Of course. Do you know how much I suffered? I climbed up and down cliffs countless times. Every time my hands gave out and I thought I was going to die, I endured by thinking of revenge!"

Shirone began to feel uneasy. If Rian had been nurturing his hatred day by day, then in his eyes, Shirone would seem more hateful than his worst enemy.

"Not going to answer? I'm asking why you tattled, you coward!"

"I didn't tattle—I just told the truth."

"Haha! You told the truth? Then shall I also tell the head butler the truth about what you did? Then your life is over! You understand?"

Faced with such unreasonable stubbornness, Shirone gave up on persuasion. He had felt keenly how different the mindsets of nobles and commoners were. The best course was not to escalate things further.

"If I'm at fault, I'll accept whatever punishment. What should I do?"

Rian was slightly taken aback. He looked like a regular servant who had just entered the household, but his behavior was far too composed.

"Now even servants are ignoring me, is that it? Fine. I'll make you feel exactly the same pain I experienced. Follow me."

Shirone was practically dragged along as he followed Rian. It seemed he planned to take him to some secluded place and beat him half to death. The memory of what the thugs had done to him four years ago came flooding back, making his stomach churn.

'Still, it's better than dying. If he beats me, so be it. If he makes me grovel, so be it.'

He couldn't let the opportunity his parents had risked their lives to create go to waste. Whenever fear washed over him, he thought of home. He imagined his father and mother having a pleasant meal together.

The place Rian brought him to was a small training ground. Befitting a household that revered martial arts, the mansion had several training grounds of various sizes. The one they'd arrived at was Rian's personal training ground—a place where no one would come running even if someone screamed bloody murder.

While Rian lit the torches, Shirone swallowed nervously and waited. He wished it would start quickly, but the suspense made his stomach flutter. Maybe Rian was doing it on purpose. Someone who practiced swordsmanship would certainly understand the tension of confrontation.

"Here, catch this."

As the training ground brightened, Rian threw a wooden sword. With a solid sound, the wooden sword stuck to Shirone's palm. The grip of the wooden sword he was holding for the first time was thicker than an axe handle.

"Why are you giving this to me?"

"Did you think I'd just beat you up one-sidedly? I'm not a coward like you. I'm destined to become the world's greatest swordsman. Since I got stronger because of you, I'm just returning the favor. Fair, right?"

Shirone was dumbfounded. Fighting someone who had trained in martial arts since birth was no different from saying he should just get beaten up.

"What exactly was so cowardly about me?"

"I hate guys like you the most. When someone's in trouble, you don't even think twice before tattling. For guys like that, a wooden sword massage is perfect. Come at me. Considering the skill difference, I'll let you have three tries first."

Rian's eyes changed as he pointed his sword at Shirone. His personality might be strange, but those eyes were unmistakably those of the Ozent family.

Perhaps responding to his fighting spirit, Shirone found himself gripping the wooden sword with both hands. Just from the feel, the wooden sword seemed hard enough to easily break human bones.

In other words, once Rian's offered three chances ended, his own bones would be broken. All sorts of distracting thoughts flashed through his mind. He wouldn't be able to work. He wouldn't be able to read books. His parents would be looking at their son who had returned home crippled.

'What do I do? What can I do?'

Shirone steeled his resolve. He had no choice but to swing. Giving up just because the odds were low would be as foolish as throwing his future in the trash.

"Hiyaaah!"

Shirone raised his sword above his head and charged. His momentum was impressive, but Rian sneered. His stance was wrong, and his center of gravity was a mess. It was clear he'd never held a sword before.

Blocking Shirone's sword, Rian shouted.

"One!"

Crack! A crisp sound spread through the training ground. But to Shirone, it sounded like the footsteps of a lion closing in on his throat. Expelling his fear through a battle cry, he attempted a horizontal slash.

"Two!"

Hearing Rian's hearty voice made Shirone's stomach boil. Was it that fun to toy with such an inferior opponent? Biting his lip, he poured everything into his last chance.

As the wooden sword cut through the air, Rian's lips curved upward. Vertical slash, horizontal slash, vertical slash. Even for a beginner, it was a ridiculously simple pattern.

Rian readied his wooden sword in a blocking stance. Taking a step forward, he shouted.

"Now, this is the last one! From now on, it's my turn...!"

CRACK!

At that moment, the center of the wooden sword Rian was holding exploded. Rather than breaking, it had been severed. At the same time, the middle section of Shirone's wooden sword was also shattered.

Small fragments grazed Rian's face, which was frozen in shock. Hastily coming to his senses, he stepped back. Examining the wooden sword, he saw the grain of the cut surface was roughly torn. The impact hadn't been able to escape and had bounced around inside.

'This is... sword destruction?'

Weapon-breaking sword destruction technique.

Just as there was no swordsmanship without cutting techniques, every school had at least one weapon-breaking method. The Ozent family called this "sword destruction" and passed its secrets only to direct heirs.

The reason for the grandiose label of "secret technique" was that it wasn't simply a matter of being strong.

In human-to-human combat, force absorption occurred as variously as force application. Therefore, to successfully execute sword destruction, one needed the concentration of instantaneous impact—that is, special movements and mental state that targeted only the sword, not the person.

It was shocking for Rian. Even he, who had held a sword since birth, had never successfully performed sword destruction against a person.

But what felt even worse was that until now, he was the only one in the family who hadn't learned sword destruction yet.

"You... what exactly are you? Where did you learn swordsmanship?"

Shirone dropped the wooden sword, now just a handle. Honestly speaking, it had been a gamble-like strike.

With the first strike, he felt the sensation. With the second strike, he calculated the timing. And on the third, he attempted it.

Thunder Strike, which he had practiced countless times over four years.

"I've never learned swordsmanship."

"Shut up! You're rotten to the core, you bastard! Then how did you succeed at sword destruction? If you're mocking me, I'll kill you right now!"

"This is something called Thunder Strike."

"Thunder Strike?"

"My father is a hunter. Living in the mountains, I've been going to cut wood since I was young. Since I'm not big, I had to cut trees with technique, and naturally learned this skill. Among woodcutters, this is called Thunder Strike."

Rian's mind became a jumbled mess. A mountain man? He went to cut wood? What the hell is he talking about? I've been holding a sword for 16 years. This isn't a technique you can do just by chopping some firewood. Not even one person my age has succeeded at sword destruction. At most, there's only...

Rian recalled one person's face.

'Ozent Rai.'

The second son of the Ozent family, two years older than Rian. He was also the sword genius evaluated as having the greatest talent in the family's history.

Rian clenched his fists until they might break. It seemed like his brother's phantom appeared to mock him.

Rai had first succeeded at sword destruction at the young age of 12. It was a family celebration, and their father threw a grand party for a week.

Rian remembered that day's emotions clearly. And today, he had finally been overtaken even by a mountain man's son.

"I can't accept this!"

Rian shouted, driving away Rai's phantom. He had really tried. At one point, he had swung his sword thousands and tens of thousands of times.

But why could that guy do it while he couldn't?

"Young master, my being disrespectful was..."

"Shut up! Nothing's over yet! No one has lost! I am Ozent Rian!"

Rian turned and walked to the edge of the training ground. From there, he pulled out an elegant longsword used by nobles and returned with it.

Seeing the real sword, Shirone felt chilled. As Rian drew the longsword, it came out with a watery sound.

The blade, drinking in the torchlight, glowed like lava. After checking the blade's condition, Rian sheathed it again and threw it to Shirone.

Shirone stepped forward and caught it with both hands. When he looked up as if he couldn't understand why he was being given a sword, Rian pointed a finger and spoke.

"Since we both have no weapons, we can't settle this. If you've even learned sword destruction, I should treat you accordingly. One month from now, let's have a match here with real swords."

Shirone's heart sank. He had tried to survive somehow with strategy, but the situation kept getting worse. The feeling of receiving a wooden sword versus a real sword was completely different. Moreover, Rian wouldn't give him three chances anymore.

He could die. For the first time, Shirone felt the fear of death. The faces of his grieving parents came to mind. It was heartbreaking not to be able to spread his wings at such a promising age.

"Young master, please reconsider! I've never learned swordsmanship!"

"That's why I'm giving you time. You learned sword destruction from cutting wood? I don't even believe that, but even if such a talented guy exists, you should be able to manage something in a month."

Rian didn't think his words were unreasonable. Rai could do it. He was seeing his brother's phantom in Shirone. Yes, his resolve had been lacking. With real swords, in a life-or-death situation, maybe there wouldn't be such a big difference.

"Don't think about running away. Personal matters aside, I can't forgive someone like you."

Rian's final words struck Shirone's foot like a spike.
