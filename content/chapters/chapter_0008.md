The next morning.

Shirone headed to the Great Library looking exhausted. He hadn't gotten a wink of sleep because of what happened the previous night.

His troubled mind made the cataloging work drag on. Realizing this wouldn't do, Shirone forced himself to regain his composure.

Fear wouldn't solve anything. He had to come up with some kind of countermeasure within a month.

First, he needed to investigate his opponent.

Family head Bishop had three sons and one daughter. The eldest son was a nationally certified 6th-rank swordsman, and the second son, Rai, was also a sword genius who everyone believed would soon follow in his brother's footsteps.

Rian's older sister also had Ozent-level talent, but she had given up the sword because she was a woman and was currently working as a pianist in the royal palace.

Looking at each one, it turned out that Rian was the only one who hadn't distinguished himself. Even though the family head had assigned him a dedicated instructor, the only reports that came back were that he lacked aptitude.

"Sigh, I should have just minded my own business. I should have just taken the beating."

Having lived his entire life being compared to his siblings, it was only natural that Rian would flare up at Shirone's Thunder Strike. It seemed not all nobles were exceptional.

"What do I do now? This is really bad."

Once he finished assessing the situation, he felt troubled again. Under the desk, the real sword that Rian had thrown was still lying there untouched.

After staring at it for a long while, Shirone finally seemed to make up his mind and stood up abruptly, heading to the reading room.

Whether he fought or not, it was better to be prepared. Having lived in the mountains, he was confident in his stamina, so if he could at least learn how to defend himself, he might be able to save his life.

He decided to put history books on hold for the time being. Instead, he gathered every single book related to swordsmanship.

There were technical manuals like 'Swordsmanship Textbook,' as well as philosophical works like 'What is a Sword?' and 'Only Humans Fear the Sword.' He also saw practical books like 'Winning Through Bluffing' and 'The Survivor is the Strong One.'

Shirone opened a book with the straightforward title 'Swordsmanship.' It contained the history of how swords began and the overall content of swordsmanship.

Even for Shirone, who aspired to be a mage, it was fascinating content. If mages had the Spirit Zone, then swordsmen had something called Schema.

Schema was a virtual body and a human body diagram. Everyone has their own body image, and Schema was an extremely concrete blueprint of that image.

Masters of Schema understood their bodies so perfectly that they could even influence the action of individual cells.

Reading up to this point, Shirone realized that Schema was the symmetrical counterpart to the Spirit Zone.

While mages erased themselves to become one with the world, swordsmen were those who dug even more persistently into their own existence.

Shirone tried experimenting with it himself.

While feeling the brain activity of entering the Spirit Zone, he visualized a virtual version of himself in his mind.

This much was easy.

However, the virtual body was dark like a shadow, making it impossible to see inside.

'If I could lift all of this dark veil, it would become Schema. This is truly amazing.'

Shirone picked up the book again. It was written that the methods of mastering Schema varied completely from family to family, and the parts they focused on strengthening were also different.

While some families obtained Schema through mental cultivation, others used methods that pushed the body to its limits.

Some families used Schema to strengthen muscle power, others for speed, and still others to enhance the nervous system.

Shirone recalled the red-haired girl he had met in the alley four years ago. At the time, he had been too busy running away to think about it, but looking back, her movements hadn't been human.

'That girl had mastered Schema. She was about the same age as me. What incredible talent.'

This wasn't the time to just admire her. Shirone closed the book and fell into thought. Rian probably hadn't mastered Schema either. But there was something that bothered him about trying it himself.

Just as the Spirit Zone wasn't magic itself, Schema wasn't swordsmanship either. Just as knowledge was important to mages, a strong body was essential for swordsmen. Without physical backing, even if one could use Schema, the range of enhancement would inevitably be narrow.

"I already have the Spirit Zone. Rather than learning conflicting concepts, it would be faster to find a solution through swordsmanship."

He had to find something that could save his life within a month.

Shirone took out the beginner's swordsmanship textbook and turned to the first page. Although he had unexpectedly ended up studying swordsmanship, his concentration was higher than ever since his life was at stake.

* * *

"Aaahhh! Aaahhh!"

Dust rose in the great training ground. It was the dust cloud kicked up by Rian's two legs. His heart felt like it would burst. No air was coming in, causing the contents of his stomach to flow backward.

"Urgh! Urgh!"

What he had eaten for lunch came back up through his esophagus. Rian let himself vomit as much as he needed to. The only thing he cared about was his two legs.

"One hundred laps! Passed!"

Swordsmanship instructor Kite shouted heartily. Rian's changed appearance today was so pleasing to see.

"New record! But what's this about? Actually completing all your training obediently?"

"Damn it! How is this crap even training!"

"What did you say?"

Kite looked up with bewildered eyes. He had tried to give some praise for once, but true to form, the boy was immediately throwing a tantrum.

But today's tantrum had a different character than usual.

"I'm still standing here like this! Master, don't you have anything stronger?"

"Oh?"

Kite was quite surprised. It had been a long time since Rian had burned with such intensity. It seemed like the first time since he had knelt before Ozent Rai's genius two years ago.

"You... something happened, didn't it?"

Rian, supporting himself with both hands on his knees and pouring out sweat, raised his head.

"There's nothing like that."

Kite didn't believe him. In his student's eyes, which stared forward fearfully, someone's phantom was surely flickering.

'Is it Rai again?'

No matter how he thought about it, the only person who could make Rian like this was the family's second son. Had he achieved something again? But what? Hadn't Rai already mastered Schema?

It didn't matter anyway. His student was Rian, not Rai. And right now, that student was offering his neck for him to train however he wanted.

"Good! Let's really die once today! I won't take responsibility even if you actually die!"

"Bring it on!"

Rian continuously struck down with an iron rod that was twice as heavy as a longsword. If he couldn't achieve Schema through insight, the only method left was to push his body to the extreme and force himself to find it.

"Taha! Taha! Taha!"

Kite watched with satisfaction as Rian repeated vertical strikes. But as time passed, his expression grew stern. Finally realizing something, he opened his eyes wide and rushed over.

"You crazy fool! Stop! Your muscles will burst at this rate!"

"They haven't burst yet!"

Kite stopped mid-run and looked at his student. Tears were flowing from Rian's eyes as he gritted his teeth and swung the rod.

"Damn it! Why won't my muscles burst! Why won't my arms break! I can do more! This isn't the end! I'm not finished yet!"

Tears also welled up in Kite's eyes. He was just as frustrated as his student. Why wasn't it working? He was pushing his body to the very limits of limits, so why couldn't he unlock Schema?

Kite wiped away his tears with his thick arms. This wouldn't do. If the master started doubting, what would happen to his student Rian?

Kite caught Rian's iron rod slicing through the air with his palm. Even Rian couldn't be stubborn when he struck his master's hand, and he stopped his movements.

"Rian, this is enough. Let's stop for today."

At the warm voice, Rian's madness faded. The sensation in his arms had disappeared long ago. Not even realizing that the club had fallen to the ground, Rian hung his head low and said:

"Yes, thank you."

Kite placed an ice towel on Rian's shoulders. Seeing that his bones weren't damaged, there was no denying that he was naturally strong-boned.

Rian sat on the training ground hill, staring at the distant mountains. Kite, having finished the treatment, sat beside him.

"What are you thinking about?"

"That my arms hurt like hell."

A smile appeared at the corner of Kite's mouth.

"Rian. I've never once written in my reports to the family head that you have talent."

"Tch, who's asking?"

"But I think you have talent. Being able to achieve something quickly isn't the only form of talent. Desperately challenging what cannot be achieved - that too can be called talent."

"You don't need to comfort me. It sounds nice, but frankly speaking, I work myself to death because I have no talent."

"Is that really so? Geniuses know they're geniuses. Therefore, they also clearly understand what they can do. Have you ever thought that way?"

"Well. I know well what I can't do, though."

"Right. That's why you're not a genius."

Rian looked back at Kite with an incredulous expression. Rather than pouring oil on a burning house, here was a master making his insides burn when his arms already hurt like hell.

"Stop it. I know well enough already."

As Rian pouted, Kite smiled.

"But you know, Rian. Do you know what geniuses fear most? It's effort. Making an effort ultimately means you don't possess that thing. You make an effort because you have no talent? Not at all. In this world, the only people who can make an effort are those who make an effort."

Kite grabbed Rian's shoulders and gently applied pressure.

"Geniuses fear you. Because you have the power to seize what they cannot possess. Those who make an effort are the natural enemies of geniuses."

Natural enemy of geniuses.

Rian liked this phrase. Even if it was just words to comfort a pathetic student, he didn't care. Right, he simply didn't possess it. If he never had it from the beginning, he just had to desperately obtain it.

Rian clenched his fists. He planned to pour everything into the remaining month.

* * *

Shirone clearly knew what he could do.

Not even harboring lingering attachment to Schema and seeking other methods also showed his completely opposite temperament from Rian.

Even so, talent plots the most efficient shortest route to the destination. Shirone set aside miscellaneous techniques and dug only into the basics of swordsmanship.

A month passed in a flash.

Eight directions of cutting and eight directions of blocking. Having become able to perform these two things satisfactorily, Shirone ended his training.

And finally, he posed a question that encapsulated what he had learned:

"What is swordsmanship?"

The totality of kinetic mechanics arising for the purpose of killing life. It was also advanced psychology in that it divided life and death.

Shirone assumed an imaginary Rian and pointed his sword. The enemy would probably move from every conceivable angle.

But it was all false. Only the sword coming to cut him was real.

Shirone responded to his imaginary enemy with imagination. His sword stretched like a phantom and suppressed all eight directions. As another exchange was fought, it dispersed into dozens of branches.

'I'm not counting numbers. I'm feeling it as a whole.'

If you focus on the trees, you can't see the forest. Appreciating possibilities as a whole - that was exactly insight.

But it wasn't as easy as it sounded. As various patterns branched out like fractals, he kept fixating on attacks from specific parts.

'It's okay if I can't do it. Let me observe.'

Gradually gaining momentum, Shirone completely released his thoughts at a certain point. All possibilities began to be sucked into the infinite void as a whole.

"Huh? Huhhhhh?"

Shirone looked at the world with astonished eyes. There was no end. The entire world was being filled with his and Rian's swords.

Unable to handle the overwhelming vastness, Shirone dropped his sword and staggered.

"Haha, hahaha."

A hollow laugh. Like magic, the sword was also infinite. He had experienced the infinite world that derived from a single sword.

'So this is the path swordsmen chose.'

Wasn't he also walking the infinite path called magic? An inexplicable sense of kinship made him feel good.

'Mom, Dad, I'm sorry. I might not be able to come home.'

He had no regrets. Rian would feel the same way. Standing before the crossroads of life and death, he was glad he could see a glimpse of such a magnificent world.

From outside the Great Library came the sound of bells announcing that midnight was approaching.

Rian, trying to possess what he could not have. Shirone, having finished everything he could do. The collision of these two mirror-like symmetrical boys was now just one hour away.
