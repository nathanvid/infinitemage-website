The great training ground.

Shirone arrived punctually. Rian was already there, waiting for him.

The battle had essentially already begun. The two didn't approach each other, instead staring at one another from a distance.

"Let's begin."

Rian had chosen the same weapon as Shirone—a long sword.

The domineering and spirited Ozent swordsmanship was better suited to great swords than long swords.

But since that was only possible with Schema, rather than considering Shirone's needs, it was more a matter of choosing a weapon suited to his current capabilities.

Shirone had taken the stance of stillness-in-motion from basic swordsmanship. Though it was a simple movement, even Rian could see that his center of gravity was much better positioned than before.

'Is that really... possible?'

Rian saw Rai in Shirone once again. A thought suddenly occurred to him. Perhaps this boy really had never learned swordsmanship.

'But how can he be so calm? Isn't he afraid of death?'

Even Rian, who had trained with the sword for sixteen years, feared death. That was why he pushed his body to its limits to build confidence.

On the other hand, Shirone didn't have the same kind of courage as Rian. He was a herbivore who loved peace and hated fighting.

But intelligence always seeks maximum efficiency. Having analyzed fear of the real blade as the greatest risk factor in this confrontation, Shirone worked to find a solution and finally arrived at an answer.

If you can't overcome fear, then understand it.

In sword philosophy, this is called "jumping off a cliff." Any human can jump off a cliff. As long as they don't think about the fact that they'll die.

For example, certain types of people in the world don't feel fear. Power holders, business people, criminals—their professions vary, but what they have in common is that they don't imagine the consequences beforehand.

A serial killer pursues only momentary pleasure without thinking about the death that awaits when caught. Some dictator leisurely enjoys a banquet even as rebels break through the gates. For them, the future is an illusion that doesn't exist for even 0.1 seconds.

Shirone imagined standing at the edge of a cliff. Then he extended his right foot into the air and drew his left foot forward.

Shirone did not fall. If you don't imagine the future, then even the space beyond the cliff is merely a state just before falling.

'Until you fall, you haven't fallen. Until you die, you aren't dead.'

The reason intelligence is sometimes more frightening than courage is because it understands the essence of danger like this.

And Shirone's mind, frozen in this way, consequently brought about a dramatic increase in the stability of his Spirit Zone.

"Here I come!"

Just as Shirone entered his Spirit Zone, Rian closed the distance.

A flash seemed to streak before Shirone's eyes. It was definitely spirited swordsmanship on a different level from a woodcutter's axe work.

But Shirone had his Spirit Zone too.

Feeling the trajectory of the sword clearly through his synesthetic perception, he opened his eyes wide and evaded the attack.

Rian's expression changed to one of bewilderment. For a beginner to visually track the movement of a real sword was absolutely impossible.

But sword techniques are also infinite. There were definitely parts that Shirone couldn't predict. As the blade sliced past Shirone's chest, his Spirit Zone momentarily wavered.

Shirone's heart sank. At this rate, he would be helplessly defeated.

But Rian's following attack was unexpectedly violent. Thanks to this, Shirone was able to throw his body aside and avoid death.

'Why such an attack?'

There was no need for great force—a simple cut to the ribs at the shortest distance would have ended it. But Rian seemed not to notice Shirone's wavering and came at him with large movements.

'Perhaps his understanding of swordsmanship is lower than expected?'

Shirone's assessment was accurate. While Rian was skilled in swordsmanship itself, his insight was lacking, and his understanding of the essence of swordsmanship was poor.

Shirone adjusted his evaluation of Rian's ability downward. Setting the enemy as too strong was foolish—it meant giving up any chance of counterattack. To win, he had no choice but to take risks.

As Shirone began his counterattack, the tension of death heightened and Rian's stamina rapidly depleted. After dozens of exchanges, Rian was finally shocked.

'Damn it! This can't be! This can't be happening!'

The techniques his opponent was using were nothing but basic cuts. Yet they were hard to block. He was targeting only the parts that couldn't be blocked.

Suddenly, Rai's face came to mind. In their confrontation two years ago, his brother had subdued Rian with just one hand. Rai's face, lips twisted in a mocking smile, was still vivid in his mind.

"Don't make me laugh! I'm going to become the world's greatest swordsman!"

The more aggressively Rian charged forward, the more puzzled Shirone became. What was this boy thinking? Didn't he want to win? Why was he being so stubborn? Did he even think at all?

'Huh? What?'

Shirone gradually realized he was being pushed back. From some point on, he could no longer read his opponent's movements. Rian's sword, swung with conviction, began approaching Shirone as an unpredictably complex puzzle.

"I won't lose! I'll definitely overcome this!"

Rian pressed his advantage and cornered Shirone. Shirone's stamina rapidly hit rock bottom. Though he had efficiently distributed his energy until now, an absolute difference still existed. His sword felt heavier.

"This is the end!"

Rian, letting his long sword drag, rushed forward and swung upward as if to split Shirone's jaw. Shirone also swung his sword downward with all his might.

With a clang, one sword shot into the sky and embedded itself in the far side of the training ground.

Silence fell.

The two gasped repeatedly while glaring at each other.

Rian slowly lowered his gaze. He could see Shirone's sword pointed at his solar plexus.

Just before the swords collided, Shirone had twisted his wrist like a whirlwind, striking Rian's sword upward from below. With the added impact on top of momentum, Rian, whose stamina had fallen, finally lost his grip on his sword.

It wasn't a technique attempted with confidence. Just a difference in understanding of swordsmanship. He had taken the risk thinking that only attacks that could actually cut him were real.

Shirone didn't relax his tension. He wanted to collapse right then, but he couldn't carelessly throw away the life he had fought so hard to preserve.

"Ah, I lost."

Rian readily acknowledged his defeat.

"Ah, I lost. I lost."

Though Rian scratched his head irritably, his fighting spirit had already disappeared. He had trained to his limits and fought with all his might. Therefore, no regrets remained.

"You won. Since I lost in combat, I'd have nothing to say if you killed me."

It wasn't a childish statement. But Shirone found this even more disagreeable. Could someone really be this immature?

"Are you joking right now?"

"What?"

"If I kill the young master, do you think I'd be able to live? How can you say something so ridiculous?"

"Good grief! What does that matter? Is that something to say to an opponent you fought with your life on the line?"

"Only the young master put his life on the line! I just fought to survive! This whole absurd duel doesn't make sense from the start—how is it reasonable to blame me because you originally hid to avoid training?"

Rian was flustered. Normally after men fight, even if it's not exactly heartwarming, shouldn't there be an exchange of hot, weighty words?

But this seemed ready to devour him with nagging.

"Hey, man! Who's blaming you? Your behavior was so pathetic! No matter if we'd just met, in that situation, loyalty should have kicked in—that's normal!"

"What nonsense about loyalty!"

"What did you say?"

Shirone was indignant. For a month, he'd been so preoccupied with the problem at hand that he hadn't had time to think about anything else, but now that it was over, he couldn't control his anger.

"You call that loyalty? Have you ever once thought about the burden a regular servant should bear between the family head's son and the swordsmanship instructor? Did you ask me that favor knowing this?"

"Huh? Well..."

Rian blinked. To Rian, who had learned by getting beaten every day, Shirone's scolding was an unfamiliar attack.

"If the young master were truly a man of honor, he should have been ashamed to burden a mere servant and stepped forward before the swordsmanship instructor himself. Wouldn't that have been truly cool and honorable?"

Rian was silent for a long time. From how he repeatedly smacked his lips, Shirone could gauge his personality.

He wasn't the type to make up words.

Since he had nothing to say, he said nothing.

But this made Shirone even more disgusted, so he gave up on scolding and sat down.

"Hah, I really almost died."

Rian studied Shirone as he grumbled. The strongest opponent who had overcome even the fear of death and cornered him had disappeared, and it seemed like just a kid was sitting there.

Who was he really? He was definitely a genius. But he wasn't Rai. Unlike his brother who had deflected his sword with one hand while sneering, this boy had used his whole body to face him.

"What's your name?"

Shirone raised his head. Looking up from his seated position, Rian seemed even bigger.

"Arian Shirone."

"I'm Ozent Rian."

It was funny for a noble and commoner to exchange names, but even more absurd was this: Did he really think Shirone wouldn't know the name of the family's youngest son?

Rian paid no attention to Shirone's blank expression and walked over. Shirone's head tilted even further up. Rian extended a hand as big as a pot lid and spoke in his thick voice.

"Let's be friends. What do you say?"

**The First Step Toward a Dream (1)**

A full year had already passed since entering the Ozent household.

Shirone had turned seventeen, and over seven thousand books had left the Great Library.

Though Temuran was amazed by this incredible work pace, Shirone had already foreseen it. As the number of books to be sorted decreased, efficiency naturally accelerated.

In his thinking, all things in the world seemed subject not to constant velocity but to acceleration. Even if the beginning was slow, by not giving up and persevering, one could reach their goal faster than expected.

Of the target 850 history books, only about 200 remained. His average reading was over three books per day, and in just a few months, the backbone of knowledge he'd dreamed of would be complete.

Beyond that, he had experienced swordsmanship and understood the essence of fear. Thanks to this, he'd been able to dramatically increase his Spirit Zone's endurance.

Thus, the year he had spent was fulfilling and beneficial.

But no benefit could compare to the first true friend Shirone had made.

"There are so many books. I wonder if our family has read all of these?"

Rian, sitting on the floor, muttered while glancing at the books. Now that Shirone had befriended him, Rian turned out to have an affectionate and charming personality. Should he say it was fitting for the youngest son of a noble family?

Shirone spoke while organizing books from atop a ladder.

"Of course. The family head and the elder young master visit the library frequently."

"Tch, smart people have it good. They know how to do so many things."

When Rian threw down the book he was reading, Shirone climbed down from the ladder, picked it up, and unleashed his scolding.

"Don't throw it carelessly. If even one book gets damaged, I'm dead."

"That's another thing I don't like. How does it make sense that books are more important than human life? Even if you burned down the library, I'd protect you, so don't worry."

"As long as you just stay still, that'll never happen, so please be careful."

Never once had embarrassing words come from Shirone's mouth. Firm and strict, but not cold. Rian liked Shirone that way.

"It's nice being with you, but being cooped up only in the library is suffocating."

"Why are you hanging around here anyway? What about training?"

"Just basic training. I said I wanted to study in the library."

Shirone trembled with frustration.

"Then you should study quickly—what are you doing?"

"I'm bored! Bored! Bored!"

Rian flailed his arms and legs like a spoiled child.

Shirone turned away dismissively and headed to his desk. He wasn't particularly worried about Rian's laziness. If he was water, Rian was fire. Once ignited, a fire that grows uncontrollably large.
