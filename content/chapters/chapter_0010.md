Shirone grabbed the history book and started nagging again.

"Get up and bring a book. Let's study."

"Ugh, the training has been way too intense lately."

After sending Rian to the study, Shirone sat down and opened his history book. Recently, he had been finishing fieldwork faster than paperwork, giving him quite a bit of free time.

Once he began concentrating on the book, the pages flew by in an instant.

Upper left, lower left, upper right, lower right. Four glances and two pages were done. Moreover, his rhythm was rarely broken until he finished reading an entire book.

This meant that the scope of knowledge in his head had surpassed the scope of the book. Having read through 650 history books, he could digest the remaining 200 or so like drinking water.

"Hey, Shirone. I found an interesting book here."

Rian approached, waving a book. But soon he spotted Shirone flipping through pages at tremendous speed and didn't dare disturb him. For instance, it had once taken Rian over 10 hours to turn a single page. He had definitely been reading the book, but when he opened his eyes, it was morning.

Rian took the seat next to Shirone and opened the book he had brought. The interesting book he had discovered had this title:

Swordsman VS Mage.

"Preface. You must have asked yourself this question at least once. If a swordsman and a mage were to face off, who would win?"

As Rian read aloud, Shirone's hand turning pages hesitated slightly. It was content that would prick up the ears of any aspiring mage.

"I wandered the world to find that answer. Even now when I close my eyes, I can see it shimmering. The Artusna mountain range at 6,000 meters above sea level. There were carnivorous trees that ate mountain birds..."

Rian slammed the book shut.

"Damn boring."

"What? I think it's interesting!"

Startled by Shirone's outburst, Rian's shoulders jumped. He had been pretending not to care while perking up his ears like a fox.

"What's so interesting about it? There are no pictures and no talk about swordsmanship."

"You haven't even read a single page and you're saying that!"

"An author should have consideration for readers. Start interestingly, end movingly."

"This isn't a novel. Give me the book. So who wins in the end?"

"What does it matter who wins? Are swordsmen and mages crazy enough to duke it out? If the situation is favorable, they charge in; if unfavorable, they run away."

Shirone opened 'Swordsman VS Mage' to the middle section and searched through the pages.

"There might be cases where they have no choice but to fight. If that happens, who would win?"

"Well. If I had to guess..."

"Obviously the swordsman wins."

A sharp voice came from beyond the bookshelf. Then a man with a cold impression revealed himself. He wasn't as burly as Rian, but he was much taller with long, slender limbs.

It was Ozent Rai, the second son of the Ozent family.

Even as brothers, his atmosphere and appearance were quite different from Rian's. First of all, his hair was jet black.

The Ozent family had two undiluted bloodlines running through it: blue hair and black hair.

The family head Bishop, the eldest son, and the second son inherited black hair, while the water-colored hair was passed down to the second daughter and youngest son Rian.

Additionally, Rian's grandfather, who was a state-certified Level 3 swordsman, also had blue-tinted hair.

Of course, the family members were connected by strong bonds.

But sometimes they would take sides according to bloodline, which was interesting. Which bloodline was superior alternated with each generation, and this time the black hair lineage continuing through Bishop and Rai was dominant.

"Ah! Hello."

Shirone hurriedly bowed his head. No one in the family knew that he was friends with Rian. If Rai had heard their earlier conversation, even receiving a beating wouldn't be enough punishment.

"The swordsman wins? How can you be so certain? Because your brother is a swordsman?"

Rian also knew this fact, so he tried to hold Rai's attention with a sarcastic tone.

"Do I need to attach such a grand word as certainty? It's a fact that becomes clear just by knowing what position mages and swordsmen hold on each continent."

Fortunately, Rai didn't seem to care about his relationship with Rian, but he couldn't be at ease. Every time he came to the library, he felt this, but Rai was a man whose thoughts were difficult to read.

"Position aside, this is about a direct confrontation. You're not going to say the same thing on a battlefield, are you? I'm higher ranked than you, so step back. Like that."

Rian laughed heartily as if he had scored a point.

But Rai didn't even care and looked at Shirone with indifferent eyes.

"What do you think, kid?"

"Um... assuming the highest level, magic has tremendous power, so it could deal fatal damage to a swordsman. But swordsmen have superior physical abilities, so if they rush in before magic can be cast..."

"No, you're wrong. A mage cannot beat a swordsman."

Shirone felt a surge of anger. Though he was still just an aspiring mage, being a mage was his dream. It was unpleasant to hear that his dream was absolutely inferior to something else.

Seeing his friend being dismissed, Rian also got heated and snapped back.

"What gives you the right to say that? Do you think you're some kind of representative of swordsmen?"

Rai lifted the corner of his mouth. It was the sneer that Rian detested terribly.

"A swordsman's pride isn't something just anyone can obtain. But a mage's knowledge can be bought with money."

There was bite to Rai's words. In reality, swordsmen had methods to neutralize magic.

Artifacts called 'Anti-Magic.'

Anti-Magic generated special waves that disrupted a mage's Spirit Zone. When the Spirit Zone wavered, magic power inevitably dropped sharply.

Anti-Magic artifacts were processed into crystal orb forms and attached to armor, shields, or swords. Because they required a dragon's heart that emitted mana waves, the highest-grade artifacts were so expensive that even considerable nobles couldn't covet them.

Moreover, equipping 10 artifacts with 10 percent efficiency each didn't mean you could defend against 100 percent of magic.

Because waves resonate, even adding new waves to Anti-Magic waves inevitably created overlapping parts.

Ultimately, the more artifacts you equipped, the lower the efficiency became, and the key was how much you could suppress this.

Among existing artifacts, the best was the 'Five Sacred Armor Set' created by Archmage Yakra. Artifacts were embedded in the helmet, armor, gauntlets, boots, and shield, each achieving the single maximum efficiency of 20 percent.

According to research, wearing the complete Five Sacred Armor Set could achieve a suppression power of as much as 65 percent. Having magic power weakened by 65 percent was no different from being bound hand and foot for a mage.

Another troublesome thing was the 'Essence of Spirits.' These essences, which crystallized in extremely small amounts in nature, came in four types—fire, water, wind, and earth—and when equipped, they could not only activate magic but completely block the corresponding element.

The number of essences discovered so far was 17 worldwide—fire 2, water 3, wind 5, earth 7—with each one's value exceeding a small kingdom's budget.

Shirone imagined it. If a master of Schema wielding a sword while wearing the Five Sacred Armor Set equipped with all four essences—what mage could possibly face them?

Of course, this was only theoretically possible. The Five Sacred Set was scattered across the world with unclear origins, and the Essence of Spirits couldn't be obtained without national-level resources.

Equipping multiple Anti-Magic items was also problematic. Even Yakra, a master of wave equations, spent 10 years tuning the Five Sacred Armor Set.

Carelessly layering Anti-Magic items would typically just waste money. Without the integration of wave formulas, resonance frequencies, and mana interactions, efficiency wouldn't improve.

The saying that trying to raise Anti-Magic by 1 percent could cost half a noble's fortune wasn't just a joke.

The swordsman's dilemma started here. Rather than investing massive amounts to raise Anti-Magic, it was much cheaper to bring along a mage who had learned Anti-Magic spells.

Rai's words contained this implication. Mages were merely subordinate to swordsmen. Also, he was saying this: a mage's knowledge could be bought with money anytime.

The one who developed Anti-Magic into artifacts wasn't a swordsman but a mage. Countless mages were researching the effects of dragon mana on Spirit Zones even now. This was because achieving results could bring tremendous wealth and honor.

Rai was pointing out the irony that mages who made their living from magic were researching ways to weaken magic. He was saying that mages who sold themselves for money could never beat swordsmen.

"How about it? You seem to like books. Magic can be blocked with Anti-Magic and that's it. But a swordsman's body is different. Our physical abilities can only be obtained through pain alone."

Shirone understood Rai's words. But he didn't agree with his thinking.

"That's exactly what makes them mages."

"What?"

Rai was puzzled when Shirone readily agreed. A boy who liked magic should normally get angry.

"Mages are people who persistently delve into the harmony of all things. Therefore, it's not strange for them to research methods to suppress magic. What they consider important isn't whether they win or lose in a fight, but whether they know it or not. Consequently, artifacts are also products of that boundless intelligence. Yet saying that this means swordsmen can beat mages—I think the premise is wrong from the start."

Rai wasn't straightforward like Rian. He had the personality to use any logic to suppress an opponent if he could win.

Still, the reason he kept his jaw firmly shut was because he couldn't find words to refute Shirone's logic.

Rian struggled to hold back his bursting laughter. Seeing his brother, who always acted like he knew everything, become speechless at Shirone's words was incredibly satisfying.

'Hahahaha! Serves you right. My friend's way with words is amazing, isn't it?'

As time passed, Rai's expression became increasingly distorted. His brow furrowed and veins stood out at his temples. But that didn't make missing thoughts appear.

"Ideals are different from reality. Whatever intention you have, the fact that you can't win in a fight doesn't change."

Rai turned away coldly and left the library. At this sight, Rian puffed out his cheeks trying to suppress his laughter.

'Different from reality? That's all you can say? Ugh, smells like stupidity. Go ahead and leave. Hurry up and get lost.'

Then when the library door closed, he couldn't hold back and burst into laughter.

"Hahahaha! Shirone, you're the best! I've never seen my brother make that kind of face before!"

Even while Rian hugged and shook Shirone like a doll, Shirone didn't take his eyes off where Rai had left.

Swordsman versus mage.

The single book Rian had brought presented many topics for Shirone to contemplate. Perhaps reality was different, as Rai said.

But Shirone believed.

The spirit of mages who unhesitatingly put even their own weaknesses on the experimental table—that was the very reason intelligence existed in this world.

* * *

The Great Library felt chilly enough to sense the cold. The bookshelves that had been packed tight with knowledge were empty, and even the luminous lamps that had shone bright as day were turned off.

A single ray of golden sunlight pouring through a fourth-floor window was imprinted on the floor. Shirone turned pages while receiving that sunlight.

One page, one page. And finally... the last page ended and the cover closed.

Shirone stroked the back of the reddish-orange cover. Flipping a book over is easy. But making it through the valleys of hundreds of pages to finally flip it over—that wasn't something just anyone could do.

850 books of history.

Shirone had read all the history books in the Great Library.

'It's finished. This is the spine of my knowledge.'

It was warm. It felt like light was filling him.

Shirone had come to understand the world. Though he was a hunter's son, he could engage in discussions about the world in general with any noble without problem.

It was the result of selection and focus. Talent only provided efficient direction, and anyone who read 850 history books could realize where they stood.

The library relocation work had also been completed after a massive 1 year and 6 months of construction. He could return home anytime and no longer had to worry about his family dying.

It felt like a dream. Countless events flashed through his mind like dreams.
