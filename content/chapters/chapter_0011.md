"Hey, Shirone. You're still here? I thought you finished your work?"

Rian entered through the door and coughed at the rising dust. Shirone greeted his friend with a gentle smile.

"What's with that expression? Did something good happen?"

Rian was puzzled by his friend's unusual demeanor. But Shirone's next words were even more shocking.

"Rian, show me around your house."

"Huh? What did you say?"

Rian's eyes widened. Shirone, who was always principled and never made careless mistakes, was suddenly asking to tour his house.

But when he noticed the single book placed beside Shirone, he understood.

"You... you did it?"

"Yeah. There's nothing left to read, at least not in this library."

Nothing left to read.

Though Rian didn't like books, he could feel how magnificent those words were.

At this moment, Shirone looked like the very embodiment of intellect. Even the sunlight streaming through the window seemed to bless him.

"Wahaha! You really did it? You bastard! You're truly amazing, man!"

Rian rejoiced as if it were his own achievement. Of course, in his characteristically rough swordsman way. After embracing Shirone and swaying around for a while, he snapped his fingers as if struck by a good idea.

"Great! If you want to come to my house, you're welcome anytime! This worked out perfectly. To celebrate finishing your studies, I've prepared an absolutely amazing gift for you."

"What kind of gift all of a sudden? I don't need anything."

"Just follow me. You'll love it! Puhahaha!"

Shirone felt uneasy. It was strange that Rian had prepared a gift when he'd only just learned about the completion of his reading. Moreover, judging by the way his laugh lines bulged beneath his eyes, it definitely wouldn't be a pleasant gift.

Seeing the mansion up close for the first time, its sheer size was overwhelmingly imposing. He thought he understood why ancient people chose massive structures to express the divinity of gods.

"Rian, let's go in quietly. What if your family catches us?"

"What's there to worry about? The contract's over anyway, right? Besides, everyone's out. Ah, here it is. Quick, quick!"

The place Rian led him to was a woman's room with a fragrant scent. Pink curtains hung from the balcony window, and instruments including a piano were arranged throughout.

"Wait! This is your sister's room, right? Let's get out quickly! What if we get caught in here?"

"Hehehe. Just wait a moment. It should be somewhere around here."

Rian rummaged through the drawers as if he were in his own room. After searching through the lower shelves, he grabbed something and threw it to Shirone with a triumphant cry.

"Found it! Here, Shirone, a gift!"

Something fragrant and soft covered Shirone's face. When he held it up with both hands and spread it out, it was a charmingly small piece of fabric.

Shirone's bewildered face turned red. Both in shape and size, it was unmistakably his sister's underwear.

"Hey! Are you crazy? Why are you throwing this at me!"

"Puhahaha! Look how red your face got. You're seventeen now. You should be bold enough to look at panties. That's why your big brother is giving you this gift."

"Shut up! What's so bold about looking at panties! Take it back right now!"

"Oh? You're excited. Shirone finally got excited!"

Rian clutched his belly and stamped his feet. Truth be told, ninety percent was just wanting to tease, but about ten percent was genuine concern.

Having endured a year and six months cooped up only in the library, his skin was pale white and his face still couldn't shake its childish appearance.

Shirone was too starved for learning. Using shock therapy once to draw out the man inside wouldn't be such a bad idea.

But it didn't work on Shirone. After returning the panties, Shirone sighed and launched into his usual lecture.

"When will you ever mature? Playing pranks like this. It's not just anyone, it's your sister. Put it back quickly. What if we get caught?"

"She's a court musician who only comes home once or twice a year. We won't get caught anyway. But are you really not going to take it? Don't come crying to me later with regret."

"Following you here is the biggest regret of my life! Clean up quickly."

Rian crumpled up the underwear and shoved it back in, closing the drawer.

"Hey, that's going to give us away!"

"The personal maid will organize it when she has time. Anyway, it's no fun since you're not getting excited."

"Do that one more time and I'm cutting ties with you."

"Hahaha! Alright, alright. It was just a joke. Let's go to my room anyway."

Rian's room was at the very end of the corridor. Since most of the rooms were empty anyway, he said he picked whichever room was most comfortable.

True to a passionate swordsman, the room was piled with wooden swords, and the bookshelf was filled with books related to swordsmanship.

However, there weren't many professional texts, and most were novels about legendary swordsmen from mythology.

After sitting in the room and chatting about various things, the two grew bored and played card games.

They each started with the same amount of chips, but the game ended in just thirty minutes. Rian was completely defeated.

As Shirone swept up the chips, he asked, "Another round?"

"No way! Damn it. Gambling should be about luck anyway, but I must have terrible luck."

"You seem to have a habit of moving your cards outward when you get an ace. And the timing of your betting is different when you have a pair versus when you don't. Just knowing those two things, anyone could beat you."

Rian looked dazed like someone who'd been swindled.

"How the hell do you figure out stuff like that?"

"Observation is surprisingly easy. You can't see it because you're predetermined to look for something specific. Don't think about necessarily finding it, just feel the whole picture. Then you can discover it."

"Hmm, don't be obsessed with what you want to obtain, is that it? Maybe this could help with finding Schema too?"

"Probably. It had a big influence on my understanding of Spirit Zone too."

Rian repeated Shirone's words countless times. His mind felt tingly, like he was on the verge of understanding something, but he couldn't quite grasp the core.

Perhaps it was because he'd been thinking uncharacteristically hard for so long? His body grew drowsy and sleepiness poured over him. After stretching lazily, Rian lay down and said, "Nothing to do anyway, let's sleep a bit. I'm dead tired from running a hundred laps this morning too."

"Then get some rest. I'll just read a book."

"Yeah."

Rian fell asleep the moment his head hit the pillow. Shirone chuckled at his easygoing friend and pulled out a novel. After reading only difficult history books, time flew by unnoticed as he read adventure tales.

When Rian didn't wake up even after an hour, Shirone closed his book and tidied up the room. Once the sun set, the house would become bustling, so it seemed best to leave soon.

As he walked down the corridor, he heard piano music.

Shirone was shocked and stopped in his tracks. Having grown up only in the mountains, sheet music filled with a composer's inspiration shook his heart in a way different from magic.

The sound flowed from Rian's sister's room. Without realizing it, Shirone moved toward it and saw Rian's sister for the first time.

A pure face like morning dew. A woman with blue hair flowing like waves was playing the piano.

She was Ozent Reina, the second daughter of the Ozent family.

The melody Reina played was truly heavenly music. Though not the youngest, she was a talented musician who had been recognized for her skills and entered the royal castle at nineteen, so Shirone's assessment wasn't excessive.

Harmonies building layer by layer. The rush of those harmonies. And then variations. Shirone's mind moved along with Reina's fingertips like a marionette caught in the melody.

Only after the performance ended did Shirone realize where he was. Perhaps the emotion had lasted too long. When he came to his senses, Reina had already turned toward him and was waving her hand.

"Hello? How was it, my piano sonata?"

He'd read about it in books but had never heard it with his own ears. Shirone didn't dare offer an opinion on Reina's performance.

"Come over here and look if you want. I don't recognize your face. Are you a new servant?"

"Yes. I was in charge of library cataloging work. It's finished now though."

"Aha! I heard about that. You must be really smart. Cataloging work isn't something just anyone can do."

Perhaps because she was an artist, her words and actions weren't authoritative at all, and instead showed consideration.

For the first time, Shirone envied Rian for having such a sister. Then he involuntarily remembered the disgraceful crime he'd committed. As what he'd seen overlapped with Reina's face, his cheeks burned hot.

"Ugh!"

"Are you feeling unwell somewhere? Why do you look like that?"

"N-no, I'm fine."

Shirone entered the room with awkward movements. They say the perfect lie is one that even deceives yourself. Shirone hypnotized himself into believing he hadn't seen anything and changed the subject.

"This is what sheet music looks like, right?"

"Huh? Yes, that's right. It's Schreiman's Piano Sonata 3rd movement, 'In the Darkness.' Have you ever played piano before?"

"No, never."

"Really? Sit over here. I'll teach you. It's not a difficult piece."

Shirone felt drawn to her kind and caring nature. Of course, he was also bewildered since he'd heard from Rian that she was a wicked-tempered witch.

Following her instruction, Shirone pressed the first chord while paying attention to fingering technique. Then he moved hesitantly and connected to the second chord.

"Wow! You have incredibly quick eyes. You say it's your first time, but your sight-reading is really good."

Playing unfamiliar sheet music is called sight-reading. It requires technical talent more than emotion, and people with excellent sight-reading can be considered to have fast thinking speed.

Shirone was pleased by Reina's praise. But forgetting his feelings about Reina, he became absorbed in the piano. It was an unstoppable curiosity.

"I'm sorry, but..."

"Yes?"

"Could you play it once more for me?"

At that moment, Reina discovered Shirone's unique temperament. The idea that artists love talent is a lie made up by critics. Rather, artists loved passion.

"Alright. Then listen carefully."

Reina encored "In the Darkness." Even to Shirone, who was an outsider, it was a much more delicate performance than the first. It was the power of Schema. Her nervous system, which understood her own body, was twice as sensitive as an ordinary person's.

When the performance ended, Reina turned her head with a satisfied expression. But Shirone remained lost in thought without showing any expression, like someone who hadn't heard anything.

"May I try it?"

"Huh? Oh, sure."

"Please understand even if it sounds terrible."

"Hoho, of course. Everyone's like that when they first try."

Shirone's hands gently rose to the keyboard. Just as she was thinking his posture was quite good, Shirone's fingers began striking the keys.

As unknown music was played, Reina wore a troubled smile. But from the middle section onward, as if realizing something, she began listening intently.

'What is this child? What exactly is he trying to do?'

All the notes were off. Completely wrong. But amazingly...

It was perfectly similar.

She couldn't really explain it, but that was the truth. Certainly Shirone lacked the technical proficiency to perform sheet music.

But excluding the technical aspects, he was imitating everything about her as if he had become Reina.

This wasn't a performance meant to show someone. In this child's mind, there was only the piano.

'A little more. Just a little closer.'

Shirone desperately tried to penetrate the music. Maintaining the beat made the development too fast. With his sight-reading skills, he couldn't pick out the correct notes.

He compressed his concentration that was jumping by the second. His state of selfless absorption began being drawn into Spirit Zone.

Reina gulped. Pleasant harmonies were occasionally slipping in between the discord.

And finally, in the climax that went 'ta-ta-ta-ta!' exactly 1.7 seconds of performance perfectly matched the sheet music.

Reina felt a thrill and held her breath. Shirone maintained that state and entered the authentic cadence.

After pressing the first degree, he raised both hands high and struck the fifth degree like lightning. Then he pressed down the final first degree with the greatest passion of his life.

Kuuuuuuuuuung.

The harmonies that had continued from four minutes in the past dissolved into seven notes, spreading infinite reverberation.
