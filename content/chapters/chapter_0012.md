Reina stared blankly at Shirone, who was breathing heavily. Though it couldn't be called a proper performance and thus she couldn't evaluate his musical sense, his insight into grasping the essence was beyond imagination.

'Who on earth is he? Why would such a child be working as a servant...?'

"Ah, so noisy! You old hag!"

Shirone and Reina simultaneously turned toward the corridor.

"If you're here, then wash your feet and sleep, or play a lullaby or something! Getting beaten somewhere else and then throwing a tantrum!"

With disheveled hair and half-closed drowsy eyes, Rian, still drunk with sleep, entered the room scratching his washboard abs. Then he tilted his head upon seeing Shirone sitting next to his sister.

"Huh? Shirone, what are you doing here?"

"Well, you see..."

It would be terrible if Reina found out that he was friends with Rian.

But Rian seemed unable to think that far ahead and muttered something before suddenly clutching his stomach and bursting into laughter.

"Puhahaha! Don't tell me? You came to get that thing?"

Shirone's face flushed red with unbearable embarrassment. What would Reina think of him if she learned about the crime Rian had committed? And how mortified would she be?

"No! I just stopped by for a moment."

"No, what? Congratulations, Shirone. You've finally become a man."

Rian was shameless. Of course, underwear among family members would be as trivial as dishcloths. But for Shirone, who was on the receiving end, it was an unbearable pressure.

"What? You two knew each other?"

"Shirone? Oh, he's my friend."

"Rian! What are you saying?"

"Hahaha! It's fine. That witch has a terrible temper, but she doesn't care about this kind of thing at all."

Was that really true?

He knew she had an artistic and open-minded personality. But this was the most serious situation that could occur between a noble and a commoner.

"So your name was Shirone. Don't worry. If you're Rian's friend, then you're a friend. He may be a pathetic brother, but he's not the type to toy with people."

Shirone didn't drop his suspicious gaze. Though he might feel bad about being on the receiving end, Reina actually viewed Shirone's attitude favorably. True trust sprouted from suspicion, after all.

"But you're quite unusual. How did you manage that performance earlier?"

"What? Shirone played that? I thought it was sister's hysteria acting up again."

Shirone's brow furrowed. He couldn't understand how anyone could call such a pretty and kind sister a witch or hysterical.

"Rian, why did you lie to me about her? She's gentle and wonderful."

"Shirone, you must never be fooled! This woman is a witch! She might devour you someday!"

Rian grabbed Shirone's shoulders and shook him. His expression was too serious to dismiss as a joke.

"Hehe, sorry. My brother is just so immature. Still, I'm relieved he has a friend like Shirone. He's pathetic and hopeless, but please take good care of him."

Rian walked to the table and poured water. Between siblings, whatever they said never really registered anyway.

"Oh, no. I'm not really..."

Reina stared at Shirone as he bashfully scratched his head. Though he was seventeen and should be fully grown, he was truly an innocent child.

"Hehe, you're really cute."

"If he's that cute, sister should keep him. I'd be happy if Shirone became family. Uhahaha!"

At Rian's mischievous joke, Shirone's face turned red as a persimmon. Yet he didn't feel bad about it because he unknowingly harbored feelings for her.

"My! You must be quite close to offer up your sister too."

"What are you talking about? Of course Shirone is like a brother, but I wouldn't mind giving away a witch like you to just anyone. Actually, Shirone would be wasted on you."

"Ah, is that so?"

Reina's body leaped gracefully into the air. Her jumping ability, which easily exceeded human height, made Shirone's mind reel.

Landing in front of Rian, Reina grabbed her brother's ear hard.

"Ow ow ow! It hurts! It hurts!"

"Caught you, you culprit!"

"Culprit? What are you talking about?"

"The one who played with my underwear. It's you, isn't it?"

"No! Why are you pinning it on an innocent person!"

"The only vigorous young men on the second floor are you and Shirone, just the two of you, and from what I've observed, Shirone would never do such a thing. So it has to be you. Now will you admit it? Why would you be interested in your sister's underwear when you find it so disgusting?"

Reina had once been a swordsman genius who rivaled Rai. The force concentrated in her fingers was tremendous.

Rian looked at Shirone with the feeling of being tempered in hellfire. In this situation, self-destruction was the only option. If he was going to die anyway, wouldn't it be better if at least one person survived?

"Fine, I did it! The underwear fell and I was going to wear it! Can't you spare even one pair of panties for your brother! Uwaaaah!"

As Reina mercilessly pulled his ear, the large Rian could only stand on tiptoes, unable to move.

"You call that an explanation? If you don't tell the truth, your ear's coming off."

"Kill me, kill me! I have nothing more to say!"

Shirone was restless. Regardless of who initiated it, it was something they had done together, so he couldn't let Rian suffer alone.

"Actually, it was me who did it."

"Shirone, no! You don't know how terrifying this witch is! Run away quickly!"

"Rian was trying to play a prank and it happened. There was no malice. But I'm truly sorry."

"Hmm, so that's how it was."

Reina opened her drowsy eyes and looked back and forth between Shirone and Rian. Then she chuckled and knocked Rian on the head.

"Ow!"

"Know that you saved your life because of Shirone. Do it one more time and I'll really make you deaf."

Rian rubbed the top of his head while grumbling throughout. What wind had blown this witch back home anyway?

"Why did you come back anyway? You already took your vacation before."

"Huh? Haven't you heard yet? About Rai."

"When have we ever cared?"

"Rai is taking the official swordsman examination this time. So I came to pick him up. He departed from the royal castle with grandfather, but said he'd meet some friends on the way."

"Official examination?"

Rian's eyes shook with shock. He acknowledged the difference in skill. His brother was a genius, after all.

But had the gap widened this much?

The official certification was the dream of all who lived in the Kingdom of Tormia and served as the standard for noble hierarchy.

The examination was held once a year, with as many as a thousand applicants.

But among them, fewer than thirty people could obtain official certification.

As a comparison, there were unofficial certifications. These were issued by institutions designated by the royal palace, with Alpheas Magic School being a representative example in the city of Creas.

Graduating from the magic school made you an unofficial 10th-grade mage, after which you would raise your grade by performing various achievements through associations or guilds.

The difference between official and unofficial certification ultimately came down to whether you received recognition from the royal castle. Therefore, while there were unofficial practitioners whose skills weren't inferior to official ones, since people tended to flock where money and honor followed, the overall level of official certification was much higher.

The fact that over half of those taking the annual official examination had obtained unofficial certification showed this difference.

"Hmph, how nice. As expected, genius is different. The family fully supports him too."

Reina looked at Rian with pity. Whether talented or not, he was her beloved youngest brother. She hoped this incident wouldn't hurt him.

"I need to go prepare dinner. It's seafood procured from the royal palace, so I need to handle it myself. Shirone, it was nice meeting you. Let's greet each other when we meet next time."

"Yes. Take care."

Shirone bowed his head, putting aside his regretful feelings. Since he would be leaving the mansion tomorrow, there would be no chance to meet Reina again. But the exhilaration of that moment playing piano with her would never be forgotten.

"Rian, about your sister..."

"Huh? What about sister?"

"Well... does she have a boyfriend or anything like that?"

The moment he spoke, Shirone regretted it. Emotions were like caged beastsâ€”once released, they could cause uncontrollable consequences.

After blinking for a long while, Rian showed his teeth in a grin.

"Shirone, don't tell me?"

"No, no! Just forget it! I'm just..."

"Puhahaha! Sister! Sister!"

As Rian ran out of the room, red-faced Shirone chased after him. As if even the time to go down the stairs was precious, Rian stuck his face over the railing and shouted.

"Sister! Shirone asked if you have a boyfriend...!"

"Hey, stop it!"

Shirone barely managed to cover his mouth and dragged Rian back into the room by his waist.

"Huh? What was that? Boyfriend?"

The maids working in the kitchen looked up at the second floor. Reina, who was handling seafood, smiled with her eyes and said.

"The kids are just playing around. Now, we just need to steam this. I've removed the poison, so please cook it according to the recipe."

"Yes, miss."

Once the serious cooking began, the maids became absorbed in their work again.

However, the young man overseeing the mansion's affairs was frowning at the earlier commotion.

Head Butler Louis.

With his natural calculating ability and meticulous personality, he had become the youngest head butler in the family's history. He wore rimless glasses that made his cold impression stand out.

"Shirone?"

The maids might not have heard of him, but the name was clearly etched in the head butler's mind. He was the contract worker boy that Temuran had brought for the Great Library relocation work.

"Why is he with the youngest master...?"

For someone who had sworn to dedicate his life to the prosperity of the Ozent family, this was a matter he couldn't just overlook. Something was definitely happening without his knowledge.

His eyes flashing, he called a regular servant and gave instructions.

"Tell the assistant butler to come to my room immediately."

* * *

From early dawn, spirited shouts echoed through the great training ground.

Rian trained with higher intensity than usual. The news that Rai would take the official examination had poured oil on his fire. He would definitely catch up. With that thought, he repeated countless strikes.

Kite watched his student's vigorous swordsmanship with conviction.

'He's definitely improved.'

Physical strength, stamina, techniqueâ€”he had made remarkable progress in every aspect. With this level of skill, he could easily subdue bandit gangs near the city.

However, when considering duels between people who had formally learned swordsmanship, he was still far from ready. The problem was Schema. Rian's greatest strengthâ€”his aggressivenessâ€”was now working as a weakness.

Rian's swordsmanship was domineering and intense. Sometimes there were moments when one needed to cool the mind and realize the essence, but he emphasized only advancing forward.

'Everyone has their own way. A shortcoming like not being cool-headed is nothing compared to that burning firepower. He has no choice but to continue this way. However, it's regrettable.'

"Taha! Taha! Taha!"

He swung a club twice as heavy as a longsword with pure strength alone. Considering air resistance, it was strength that wouldn't be lacking even with a greatsword. If only he could master Schema, it made him anticipate how much that efficiency would be maximized.

"Stop! Ten-minute break!"

Rian returned to Kite, panting heavily.

Kite discovered burning passion in his student's eyes. He had the same look one day a year ago.

It had quickly died out then, but this time was different. Rai was going to the royal palace. Rian's flame would never wither again.

"Young master! Young master!"

A regular servant working at the mansion came running frantically. Arriving in front of Rian, who was quenching his thirst, he spoke without even catching his breath.

"It's terrible! The miss says to come to the mansion quickly!"

"Sister? What's the sudden emergency? If it's about brother, I'm not interested. Tell them to handle it themselves."

"It's not thatâ€”the contract worker boy named Shirone is in mortal danger right now."
