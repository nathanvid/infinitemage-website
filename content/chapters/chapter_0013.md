Rian spat out the water he was drinking. What nonsense was this—Shirone in danger? He was even more flustered since he had been planning to see off his friend who would be leaving in a few hours.

"Shirone? What happened?"

"Well... you see..."

"Speak quickly! What's going on?"

"It seems Butler Louis reported to the head of house. I don't know the details, but I heard that the young master and a boy named Shirone have been friends..."

"Damn it!"

Rian immediately grabbed his clothes that were drying on the rocks and put them on. Kite, who had been watching, asked.

"What's wrong? And who is this Shirone?"

"He's my friend. I didn't mention him because he's a commoner, but it seems Louis tattled on us. That despicable bastard! Master, let's end today's training here. I need to go to the mansion."

"No. You cannot."

Rian, who had been about to storm out of the training ground, turned back to Kite with a bewildered expression.

"What do you mean? My friend is in danger."

"Didn't you say he was a commoner?"

"What does that matter? Master, is that the kind of person you are? You said it yourself! Anyone who can communicate with swords can become a friend!"

Kite clicked his tongue. His naive disciple had finally caused trouble. Though he didn't know the details, having lived for many years, he could roughly picture what had happened.

"What do you plan to do by going back? Are you going to whine and cry? Or perhaps put on a show to change your father's heart?"

"Master!"

"Rian, anyone can become a friend. But that's between you and that boy. Your friend has directly challenged the hierarchy of House Ozent. Childish tantrums won't work for this."

"So you're telling me to just stand by? I was the one who reached out to Shirone first. I don't want to be a coward!"

Kite stared into his disciple's eyes. Such good eyes they were—without lies, passionate, and above all, pure.

Kite unfastened the beloved sword at his waist and handed it to Rian. As the real blade approached, Rian's heart raced. He didn't know what he was supposed to do with it, but the meaning behind it was crystal clear.

If he wanted to save his friend, he needed to be prepared to draw his sword.

"If you can enter the mansion carrying this sword, I will send you. But if you don't have that level of resolve, don't move from here. This matter has already left your hands."

"Master."

A warm smile crossed Rian's lips as he looked at Kite. He bowed politely and extended both hands, and Kite silently handed over the sword.

"Thank you. I won't forget this kindness."

"Remember this: abandoning a friend is abandoning another part of yourself."

"Yes!"

Rian strapped the sword to his waist and ran toward the mansion. Kite watched him go with satisfaction. This was the end. The time of parting had come a little early, but he was glad they could separate with Rian showing such a manly attitude.

May good fortune accompany his disciple's future.

* * *

A cold atmosphere hung over the mansion. Work had stopped, and the butlers and maids kept to their positions without making a sound.

Behind the sofa where the direct family members sat, Butler Louis adjusted his glasses. Next to him, Assistant Butler Temuran glared at Shirone with a stubborn expression.

Receiving countless hostile and contemptuous gazes, Shirone knelt before the direct family members. It felt like being in the middle of a colosseum.

"Butler, report."

"Yes, head of house. Shirone, hired by Temuran, is accused of insulting the authority of House Ozent during his year and six months of residence. Numerous butlers witnessed the youngest master and Shirone associating like friends, and I myself have heard Shirone speaking carelessly to the young master. Detailed circumstantial evidence is attached in the testimony documents prepared by Temuran."

Bishop silently extended his hand backward. Receiving the documents from Louis, he roughly flipped through the pages with sharp snaps.

While their father read the documents, Reina quietly approached Shirone and whispered.

"Shirone, don't worry too much. I'll try to persuade Father. Nothing will happen."

Shirone slowly lifted his head, and his face was remarkably calm. That made it even more chilling. Even in this situation, there wasn't a trace of anxiety in his expression.

'He's not pretending to be calm. He really isn't afraid.'

Shirone wasn't afraid. His mind was currently floating outside the cliff. The future was nothing but an illusion that didn't exist. Nothing had been decided yet.

Bishop, having skimmed through the documents, opened his mouth. True to his black-haired lineage, his pale impression carried a voice that could freeze people.

"Arian Shirone, is what's written in these documents true?"

"Father, Shirone and Rian are..."

"Reina, I wasn't asking you. I'll give you a chance to speak. For now, stay quiet."

Reina thought this wouldn't be easy. Bishop, who based his power on principles and cold logic, wasn't someone who could be persuaded through emotion.

"There's one thing I'd like to ask."

Shirone spoke in a calm voice. The butlers watching were surprised by his abnormal composure, but it didn't work on Bishop.

"Speak."

"If the youngest master and I are friends, what happens to the youngest master?"

Reina's face softened lovingly at Shirone's kindness—worrying about his friend first even when facing mortal danger.

"It won't affect him at all. This is a place to interrogate you, a commoner. Whatever crime Rian may have committed, as long as it concerns family matters, we will protect and defend Rian."

Bishop's words contained thorns. Don't think we'll treat a noble's son the same as a mere commoner.

But Shirone was satisfied with that. Having shed his last worry, Shirone smiled brightly and honestly confessed the facts.

"Then I'm relieved. Rian and I are indeed friends. We've built a good friendship for a year, and we will continue to do so."

Though no one showed it outwardly, Shirone's words created great ripples. Especially when what had been half-doubt became revealed as fact, the shock to the butlers who had lived alongside them was tremendous.

A noble family's son and a woodsman's child had been friends for a year. Something that would only appear in plays had actually happened.

"The family's authority has fallen to the ground. Shirone, as head of House Ozent, I will execute you."

"Father! Wait, please listen to what I have to say! You said you'd give me a chance to speak!"

"He confessed himself. Dragging this out any longer is meaningless. Butler."

"Yes, head of house."

"Execute Shirone's punishment. Also, this matter must never leak outside."

"Understood."

Reina became desperate. She resented Shirone for remaining calm even in this situation.

But how could she stop this? Her father had never once reversed a decision he made as head of house.

"Who gave you permission to execute anyone!"

Rian burst in as if he would break down the mansion's doors. Just his entrance alone felt like the mansion's temperature had risen.

Everyone knew Rian's personality, and that was precisely the power of fire that Rian possessed.

"Who's executing my friend without my permission?"

"I am."

Bishop said curtly.

"Why are you doing this? He didn't commit a capital crime—he just became friends!"

"You don't have to commit a capital crime to die. Noble affairs are complicated. Because we bear these complicated circumstances, you too have grown up receiving privileges as a noble's son."

"If it's a privilege that requires killing friends to obtain, I refuse it!"

"You're immature, Rian. A friend is someone who shares feelings from an equal position. Do you think that child considers you a friend? How can you believe that? For example, suppose he approached you for money. Even then, you wouldn't be able to know that fact. And yet you can trust that child?"

"Shirone isn't the kind of kid who'd do such lowly things!"

"That's exactly what I'm asking—how can you believe that? Show me proof that Shirone isn't that kind of child."

Listening to the conversation, Reina bit her lips. She had been caught in Bishop's rhetoric. There was no proof that Shirone was a true friend. Whether he had approached with ill intentions or treated him with friendship, Shirone's attitude would have been exactly the same.

Rian also felt a chill from his father's logic. So cold. Asking for proof of friendship. It was so cold he felt like he might freeze.

Rian gripped the real sword at his waist. His master's heat transmitted through his hand.

"Hahahaha!"

And he laughed heartily with relief. He understood his master's true intention. The sword hadn't been given for him to throw a tantrum.

"Father really is too much. I almost fell for it. Proof? I believe in him. Even if Shirone doesn't think of me as a friend, as long as I believe, Shirone is my friend. That's the clearest proof!"

This time Bishop grew heated. Anyway, Rian's words were also true.

"So you'll defy the head of house's words? This isn't a matter between father and son. If you disobey the head's orders, you could be expelled from the family."

Bishop played his final card. Expelling his own son. Not only the butlers but even the direct family members had to be shocked by this statement.

But Rian didn't bat an eye. As if addressing not family but a superior, he expressed his will with unprecedented courtesy.

"If I must risk expulsion to protect my friend, I will gladly accept it with a smile."

Thud!

Bishop struck the floor with his boot heel. He couldn't tolerate it. His son, only 17 years old, would risk expulsion? It was childish behavior. Insolent conduct. Using the weakness of parent-child bonds to be unreasonable.

"Draw your sword. Risking expulsion means you'd abandon even family, doesn't it? If you truly care for your friend, stake your life."

Rian drew his sword. That action made Bishop even angrier.

"Are you really drawing a blade against your father?"

"This isn't a sword to cut Father. It's a sword to protect my beliefs."

"Since when have you cherished friends? You didn't even associate with nobles your age. Because they seemed to shine. You're using a commoner inferior to you as a sacrifice to find comfort."

"No. This time Father is wrong. Shirone is a friend who shines brighter than me. I want to help Shirone shine even more."

Bishop felt deflated. What exactly was that child? What words had he used to bewitch his simple-minded son so completely?

"Is it you? Did you make Rian like this? Did you convince him that commoners and nobles can be friends?"

Even with the family on the verge of chaos, Shirone remained calm.

"Yes. That's what I told him."

Rian blocked Shirone's front and said.

"Shirone, stay still. I'll handle this. No matter what happens, at least you..."

"Rian."

Shirone cut off Rian's words. At the cold tone he'd never heard before, Rian turned around with a confused expression.

"Take responsibility for what you should be responsible for."

The voice, tone, attitude, and intent behind the words—everything was as cold as Bishop's. Not only the family but even Rian felt the chill.

"Huh? Y-yes. Of course."

"But..."

Shirone continued.

"You don't need to take responsibility for things you shouldn't have to. We've always done everything together and come this far. This time too, we just need to overcome it together."

As if nothing had happened, Shirone's face became gentle.

"Even if we die, I don't regret becoming friends with you."

Shirone's final words exploded Rian's already burning chest. Tears welled up. At this point, he couldn't see anything.

"That's exactly it! Even if I get kicked out, we're friends!"

The butlers began to stir. Even those who had been cynical at first couldn't tell which side to take anymore.
