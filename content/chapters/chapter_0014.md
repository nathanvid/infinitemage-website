"Impressive, Shirone."

Reina, who had been watching Shirone with her chin resting on her hand, smiled. With a single stern remark, he had made all the adults in the room shrink back. Moreover, he had even made Rian's fiery temper blaze even hotter.

In some ways, he might have the personality most similar to Father. Even so, the reason Shirone appeared to shine was probably because his words contained sincerity rather than calculated strategy.

"Hahaha! This is absolutely magnificent! To think I'd get this excited in my old age! Youth really is the best!"

The maids screamed at the booming laughter that seemed ready to lift the mansion off its foundations. In contrast, the direct family members sighed and turned around, recognizing the voice.

An elderly man with blue-tinged gray hair stood on the second-floor balcony.

Shirone stared blankly. With a massive frame that could easily be called the final evolution of Rian, the muscles in his arms seemed ready to burst as they rippled.

This was Rian's grandfather, Ozent Clump.

"Grandfather!"

Reina stood up with the expression of someone who had gained a thousand troops and ten thousand horses. She and Rian alone had lacked the strength to persuade the black-haired head of the family. But with Grandfather, the story would be different.

"Have you arrived, Father? Reina said it would take several days."

"Hehe! My friend ran off with a young woman, so I came early. But this place is still as lively as ever. Youth really is a wonderful thing."

"It's not exactly a good thing. The family's reputation has fallen to the ground."

"I wonder about that. Watching from earlier, it seems everyone has much to say, so why don't we decide whether our reputation has fallen after hearing each person's opinion?"

Reina cheered "Grandfather is the best!" in her mind. Though Clump had already passed the position of family head to his son, his position as a third-class swordsman was enough to earn the respect of the family members.

"Then I'll speak first. I met Shirone for the first time yesterday, but he was a bright child with talent. Also, Shirone fulfilled all his duties as a contract worker and was scheduled to leave the family today. Given these circumstances, it's difficult to see that Shirone harbored any dark feelings toward Rian, and therefore I don't think he brought shame to the family's honor."

Reina delivered her opinion briefly and powerfully before sitting down. However, the tide had not completely turned. She had only managed to balance the scales.

Though blue-haired solidarity might be better than black-haired, Clump, who had once served as family head, had a fair and just personality. He also gave the opposing Rai a chance to speak.

"Then what are the thoughts of our second grandson?"

Rai answered in a cold tone.

"I don't like that kid."

The servants began to murmur. This was, after all, a statement from the family's most promising member.

"But I don't want to bother with it. It has nothing to do with me."

Bishop asked with a puzzled expression.

"What do you mean? You say you don't like that child, but you don't want to bother with it?"

"Exactly what I said. I don't like that kid. But I don't want to perjure my own feelings about not wanting to bother just because I don't like him. I said I don't want to bother because I don't want to bother. Whoever Rian befriends, I just want to finish this matter quickly and go to the royal palace."

Reina clicked her tongue. No matter that he was her younger brother, he was self-centered to the bone. But this time, his personality seemed to work in Rian's favor.

Clump chuckled like a young boy. He enjoyed seeing each family member's unique character. And this was surely the strength unique to the Ozent family, with its mixture of two bloodlines.

"Then finally, let's hear the opinion of the assistant butler who has watched the boy Shirone for the longest time."

Temuran stepped forward. Luis glanced at him sideways, meaning he should choose sides well. Among family members, what couldn't be said? But for a butler, the most important person was his employer, Bishop.

"Shirone perfectly completed all the tasks I assigned him for one year and six months."

Luis's brow furrowed unpleasantly. To think he couldn't manage to fabricate a single word. This was why he remained stuck as a perpetual assistant butler.

"Did you know they were friends?"

"I knew that he often went around with the youngest master, but I didn't know they were friends. However, in my humble opinion, if he had been a child lacking enough judgment to act recklessly, he wouldn't have been able to classify ten thousand books."

Shirone's eyes widened in surprise. He had never dreamed that Temuran thought of him this way.

Head butler Luis asked with anger in his voice.

"So you're taking Shirone's side then?"

Like an experienced butler, Temuran bowed his head with a servile smile.

"Not at all. I too was shocked that the contract worker Shirone was associating with the youngest master. I am merely conveying the facts as an assistant butler."

This could be considered the end of the judgment. Only Bishop was arguing to punish Shirone. No matter how much authority a family head had, when family members spoke with one voice, he had no choice but to change his mind.

Rian, with his tension released, let out a big breath. Shirone also looked back at Rian with a smile, feeling much more at ease.

But everything wasn't over yet.

"I cannot accept this."

This was Clump's final decision.

"Father."

"Grandfather!"

Bishop and Rian called out to Clump simultaneously. But the emotions contained in their voices were polar opposites.

"I understand that you two recognize each other as friends. But that's as far as it goes. If the relationship continues, rumors will eventually spread and we could become prey for other nobles. So I believe it's right for Rian and Shirone to consider that they've built good memories and break off their friendship here."

Reina was disappointed in her grandfather, but had no particular words to rebut. Family matters were certainly important. She had done well just by saving Shirone's life.

Clump received Rian's blazing hostile gaze with a sunny smile. How could he not know the heart of his grandson, who was so precious he wouldn't hurt even if placed in his eye? But he also had a duty to protect the family's honor. The fact that not a single person objected to this judgment was proof of that.

"Shirone, what do you think? I'm grateful that you taught friendship to my immature grandson, but could you let Rian go at this point? It's difficult for nobles and commoners to associate as friends."

Shirone, who had been staring at the marble floor, spoke.

"I cannot do that."

At this unexpectedly bold answer, not only Bishop but also Reina, Rai, and even Clump raised their eyebrows in puzzlement. But the person most flustered was Rian.

"Sh-Shirone..."

"If I, a commoner, am a hindrance to Rian's path, it's fine if we never meet again. If there are still doubts, you may even kill me. But even so, I cannot think we're not friends. Because Rian and I are friends."

Tears flowed from Rian's eyes. They were tears of shame. In one corner of his heart had been the thought that he was fortunate just that Shirone hadn't died. The one who had lacked trust was actually himself.

Finally making his decision, Rian raised his sword and shouted.

"I declare here and now!"

The family members' expressions filled with anxiety. This was different from Shirone's case. When Rian got this excited, unexpected accidents always happened.

The anxiety proved exactly right. Rian looked back at Shirone. And before uttering any words, he reversed his sword and plunged it into the floor like lightning.

The longsword pierced through the marble floor. Shirone stared blankly at his own face reflected in the blade.

At that moment, Rian knelt on one knee and bowed his head to Shirone.

"Ozent Rian of the Ozent family will, from this moment, become Shirone's sword."

"What are you doing, you fool!"

Bishop forgot his dignity, stood up, and pointed his finger. Rian's action was that absurd. Even Reina, who had been taking Rian's side, had an expression of disbelief.

"Did you just... make a knight's oath?"

A knight's oath.

While nobles receive stipends in exchange for pledging loyalty to royalty, if you trace back through time, royalty were merely nobles of some era. Therefore, royal power could always be overthrown, and knights' loyalty was limited to the stipends and honor bestowed by royalty.

But a knight's oath was different. It was a decision to return oneself to being a single sword, meaning to become the sword of a master to serve for life.

A noble who opposes the king is merely a traitor at best. But a knight who breaks a knight's oath is not only treated as less than human but is recorded in history as one who brought shame to his family for generations.

Once in a lifetime. Rian had offered such a weighty decision to Shirone at this very moment.

Bishop's insides boiled. Once a knight's oath was made, withdrawal was impossible. Even without emphasizing the weight of a knight's oath, the moment he withdrew, he would certainly be treated as the world's biggest fool.

"Rian, what are you doing?"

Shirone asked in surprise. But Rian couldn't raise his head in shame. He had wavered for a moment. Compared to Shirone, who had risked even his life to protect the name of friendship, all he had done was merely speak words.

"How about that? Now there's no backing out, right? We're going all the way."

What was a knight's oath compared to Shirone's resolve? Rian pulled out his sword with a satisfied expression and looked around at his family members. They had faces he had never seen before. He had caused a major incident, but it still felt refreshing.

Clump stroked his massive chin, lost in thought. Honestly, he hadn't expected him to be this immature. Still, he didn't feel bad about it, probably because Rian resembled himself.

'Well, to be this immature, you'd have to go to that extent. Hehe.'

Burying his complex emotions deep inside, Clump asked solemnly.

"Rian, seeing that you say you'll become a sword, does that mean that boy has such qualifications?"

"More than enough."

"Then answer me. Is the standard for that qualification the boy's greatness, or your inadequacy?"

Rian thought. Was Shirone excellent? Or was he himself lacking? Whatever judgment he made, he couldn't satisfy the Ozent family. Why had his grandfather asked such a question?

"A sword does not judge. It only protects."

Clump was satisfied. As Rian said, a sword does not think. It only needs to cut most sharply in the direction its master desires.

"You speak well, at least. Too bad your swordsmanship is pathetic. Your friend is unfortunate to have gained such a sword."

"Grandfather!"

Rian glared and shouted. But there wasn't the same tension as before. Partly because he had gone down an irreversible path, but more because everyone had lost their energy and didn't want to bother.

Clump concluded the matter as straightforwardly as his personality.

"Enough. This ends it. Help your master up too. Shirone, Rian is still an unrefined sword, but he's not a sword that will strike his master's foot. Please take good care of our grandson from now on."

Shirone bowed his head silently. To show humility here would rather harm the Ozent family's pride.

"He is a friend too good for me. Thank you for allowing it."

"What can I do about something the boy did himself? In any case, I heard the contract has ended. You were planning to return home?"

"Yes. My parents will be waiting."

"You must miss them. But now that you two have become friends who have promised each other for life, it would be unfortunate to return like this. Hey, head butler."

"Yes, elder master."

"Send off the carriage Shirone was supposed to take right now. Have them bring his parents."

"Understood."

The head butler left the mansion immediately after answering. Whether it was the family head or whatever, this matter had now completely left his hands.

Luis realized anew that there was no understanding the thinking of nobles.
