Shirone chatted with Rian in his room. It was now noon after being called out in the morning and made to kneel. So much had happened in less than half a day.
"Hehehe, you saw my family's faces earlier, right? It was so satisfying."
"By the way, Rian, are you really okay? That knight's oath thing. I'm worried you might have pushed yourself too hard because of me."
Rian's playful expression turned serious. Even the immature Rian understood the weight of a knight's oath.
"Shirone, I didn't make the oath just because you're my friend. You're different from my brother. You have the power to draw people to you. I've entrusted my life to someone like that."
Shirone felt Rian's sincerity. But as usual, he was uncomfortable with such embarrassing sentiments.
"Haha! That's a burden. But if you're going to protect me, you'll need to improve several times over from where you are now, won't you?"
"Ugh! Don't poke where it hurts. I know that already. But I was surprised by your courage. You said everything you needed to say clearly in front of all my family members, and you even subdued him. Weren't you scared?"
"Hehe, there's a special secret to that."
Shirone explained the concept of jumping off a cliff. Surely such a story would help with Rian's swordsmanship too.
But after listening for a while, the first thing Rian said was:
"Jumping off a cliff? Why would you do such a thing? Are you an idiot?"
"I-idiot?"
To be called an idiot by Rian. Even being called ugly by an orc wouldn't be this shocking.
"No, listen carefully. I'm not saying to actually jump off a cliff, but to imagine such a thing. Until you fall from the cliff, you're not dead. So if you don't worry about the future and focus on the present, you can see solutions and such."
"Either way, you'd still die if you jumped off. Think about it carefully. You die if you jump off."
"Ugh, forget it! I'm saying that if you can't jump off a cliff, you ultimately can't do anything, you idiot!"
"What, that's what you meant? Then I could jump off anytime."
"Huh?"
"For example, if I could save you by jumping off a cliff, I could jump off anytime. That's the duty of a friend and a knight."
Shirone blinked. It was completely different from what he had said, but Rian's words also made sense. No, perhaps that was Rian's way of thinking.
'He's really the complete opposite of me. It would be hard to meet someone like this.'
While he was thinking such thoughts, someone entered the room. Shirone's face turned bright red with surprise. Reina was peeking her head in and waving her hand.
"Hello. The black-haired faction's atmosphere is no joke, so I came to take refuge at the allied base."
"Get out. Men are talking here."
At Rian's order to leave, Shirone hurriedly waved his hands.
"Why are you like that, Rian? How much did your sister help us this time?"
"Hey, you don't know. This witch will definitely..."
Rian, who was about to habitually spew insults, looked at Shirone and seemed to think of something before closing his mouth. Shirone and Reina. Reina and Shirone. The two names were alternating in his mind.
The sociable Reina walked over like a cat and squeezed in between the two men.
"By the way, Rian looked cool. A knight's oath with such dramatic flair. I really can't compete with you."
"Why does that sound like you're teasing me?"
"Hehe, did I get caught?"
"Ugh, just... What's your real purpose for coming here? You came to annoy me, didn't you?"
"Hey now! What do you take your sister for? I've been playing the role of a spy quite well, you know. Serious talks are happening in that camp over there."
"What could be more serious at this point?"
"Actually, when Dad takes Rai this time, he was thinking about sending you too."
This was the first time Rian had heard such a thing. Moreover, even the genius Rai might not pass the certification, so why would he go to the royal palace?
"What are you talking about? To give me a tour?"
"No. To enroll you in Kaizen Swordsmanship School. You know it, right? The largest swordsmanship school in the Kingdom of Tormia. In 200 years, they've produced no less than 10 certified first-class swordsmen."
"What? How can they decide such things among themselves without consulting me? Besides, I can finally play freely with Shirone now, so why would I go to some school? What about Master Kite?"
"The instructor's contract ended yesterday. So he returned to his hometown this morning. He said he already said his farewells, didn't you hear?"
Rian looked at the sword his master had given him with a surprised expression. Because of his sword, his own knight's oath had been able to carry its own weight.
'Master.'
Though he was strict, he cared for Rian more than anyone. The reason he quietly terminated his contract must also have been his hope that his student could grow a little more.
"But this is too sudden. What about Shirone?"
"No, so that's what came up this time - they're thinking it might be better to enroll both you and Shirone in the swordsmanship school together. Yesterday you said Shirone is better with a sword than you, right?"
"That's true, but Shirone won't go to swordsmanship school. He has something else he wants to do. Hmm, actually I was thinking about it too, and since it's come to this, sister, ask grandfather for a favor."
"Huh? Something else he wants to do?"
Reina turned around, but Shirone couldn't say anything. Honestly, he couldn't understand what conversation was taking place. Enrolling in swordsmanship school? Him, a commoner? Whether such a method was even possible was questionable, but why they would go this far was also puzzling.
But if one understood the aristocratic way of thinking, it was only natural. Currently, no one in the Ozent family thought that Shirone shouldn't be taught something.
Since the youngest son had decided to become Shirone's sword, Shirone's growth had to be supported in order to enhance the family's honor.
When Shirone didn't answer, Rian spoke for him.
"Shirone is going to become a mage. He's not interested in swordsmanship."
Reina was shocked.
"What? A mage? So you lost a sword fight to someone aspiring to be a mage? That's really pathetic."
"Shut up! I know that too! But Shirone is a genius! If he learned swordsmanship, he'd do much better than Rai."
"Oh! He was that good?"
"N-no. How could I..."
When Reina looked at him with admiration, Shirone couldn't find a place to look and lowered his head.
Rian was displeased with such a shy Shirone. With such lack of confidence, what woman in the world would be attracted to him? Rian thought that using the underwear strategy once more was the only breakthrough.
"Got it. Anyway, I'll make the suggestion. But probably there'll be a condition that you enter swordsmanship school too, right? Dad thoroughly exploits weaknesses."
"Tch! I don't know. Let me think about it."
Rian knew his father's personality all too well. For Shirone's sake anyway, he could easily enter swordsmanship school.
Come to think of it, it was necessary for himself too. He had lost in swordsmanship to someone aspiring to be a mage. At this rate, far from being Shirone's sword, he'd become Shirone's baggage.
When someone knocked on the door, the three people's conversation was interrupted. A regular servant opened the door with a tense expression.
"Master Shirone's family has just arrived. They are to be received at the mansion, but if the young master wishes to greet them, the head of the family has ordered me to guide you."
"Oh! Shirone's parents? What will you do, Shirone?"
There was no need to even ask. Shirone's eyes were already fixed on the invisible front gate of the mansion. His bottom was fidgeting as if he wanted to run out immediately.
"Hehe. Go bring them, Shirone. We'll wait in the living room. Please guide Shirone."
"Yes, miss."
Shirone left the mansion following the butler.
Until yesterday, the butler who used to call him "Hey, hey!" had completely changed his attitude in an instant, which Shirone found disagreeable. He looked anxious as if worried Shirone might trip over a stone.
"Um, you can just act normally. It's not like I've become a nobleman or anything."
"No! How could I be so rude to someone who has become the master of our youngest lord! Please don't say such things. My head will roll."
Since Shirone had once risked his life for a single book, he understood that feeling better than anyone. But precisely because of that, he didn't want to receive such treatment even more.
"Even if you make a mistake, I'll never tell anyone, so please don't do that."
The butler nodded repeatedly with a moved expression. A commoner becoming a noble's master! To the servants, Shirone was like a hero from mythology.
Anyway, Shirone stopped paying attention. No, he couldn't pay attention. A carriage had arrived at the end of the great straight road that symbolized the Ozents.
He could see two people getting out. At that moment, Shirone's vision became hazy.
His parents, whom he hadn't seen for a year and six months, were there. All the times he had stayed up all night in the library, eating scraps, flashed by like a revolving lantern, and tears poured out from the overwhelming sadness.
Following his surging emotions, his legs moved. Without hearing the butler's shouts, Shirone ran to the mansion's iron gate.
"Mom! Dad!"
Alpheas Magic School (1)
Shirone led his parents to the reception room. Since they had cried profusely from the front gate, the eyes of all three walking down the corridor were swollen.
It would take time to compose their emotions. Whether it was Klumph's consideration or the meeting was running long, Shirone was able to share his feelings with them for a long time in the reception room.
"Let me see, our son. Your face has gotten much thinner while I haven't seen you. You've suffered. You've really suffered."
Tears formed in Vincent's eyes again. Though Shirone looked healthier than before, from a parent's perspective, he just looked like he hadn't eaten or slept well.
"Suffered? I read books and had such a fun time. Have you been well, Father?"
"Of course! I've been eating and living well naturally. Look how much your mother has gained weight. She became so pretty that you almost had a younger sibling. Hahaha!"
"Honey, what kind of nonsense are you talking about in front of our son."
Shirone smiled sadly. His parents, whom he met after a year and six months, had grown much thinner than before.
He didn't know for sure, but with daily worries about their child, how could food have gone down properly? Thinking such thoughts made Shirone's heart swell again.
Vincent suddenly became curious. At first, he had been so anxious his heart nearly burst, thinking something had happened to his child, but seeing Shirone's relaxed appearance, it didn't seem like anything bad had occurred.
"So, why did you call us? If the work is finished, you could just come home directly. Don't tell me those people are trying to keep you from leaving?"
"No. It's not that. It's just that a good opportunity has come up."
"Huh? A good opportunity?"
Shirone brought up the story of what had happened. Since he had already organized the outline in his head, the words flowed smoothly. But from the listener's perspective, it was too absurd.
Vincent's expression gradually turned to shock. Honestly speaking, from some point on, he couldn't hear Shirone's voice. He didn't understand what his son was talking about.
He became friends with the youngest lord of the Ozent family? And that friend made a knight's oath to him? Moreover, the family accepted this fact and allowed them to remain friends?
Each time he broke through the walls of common sense, it felt like thunder was striking in his head with bangs. Finally, when the story ended, Vincent silently scratched his head.
He knew his son was clever and thoughtful. But even so, this didn't make sense. Perhaps something was wrong with his son's mind? Had he fallen into delusions of grandeur from being tormented too much here?
"Shirone, tell me honestly. This father can do anything for you. What exactly happened to you? Who made you like this?"
"It's the truth, Father. Why would I tell such lies?"
"Right! You're not a child who lies. So tell me. Who bullied you? Who made your life miserable!"
Vincent was truly angry. He had encountered countless cases of commoners who got wrongly entangled with noble families and came out half-ruined.
Even Shirone thought it was an absurd story. But he couldn't think of any better way to persuade them than telling the truth.
While he was thinking in frustration, unable to do this or that, the reception room door opened and the direct family members of the Ozent family entered.
