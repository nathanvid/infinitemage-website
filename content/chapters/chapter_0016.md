"It's a pleasure to meet you. I am Bishop, the head of the family."

Bishop, the family head, greeted them on behalf of everyone. Though Clump and Rai were absent, Rian and Reina had come along instead.

Rian bowed deeply to Vincent with genuine warmth.

"Hello, Father! I'm Rian, Shirone's sword. The person who will become the world's greatest swordsman someday. Hahaha!"

"I'm Reina, Rian's older sister. I've heard so much about you."

Vincent and Olina just blinked in bewilderment. Then suddenly their mental circuits connected, and they grasped the situation and bowed their heads.

"Oh, hello! I'm Shirone's father. How could such distinguished people come to a place like this...?"

"Oh my, didn't Shirone tell you?"

"Pardon? Tell us what?"

Vincent pondered what story he might have heard. All that came to mind were his son's absurd boasts that made no sense.

"Then you're saying those words were true?"

"Ah, that could be the case. We should have come a bit earlier. Anyway, it's exactly as Shirone said. My younger brother Rian and Shirone have formed a relationship bound by a knight's oath. That's how we've managed to escort you here with great difficulty."

Finally understanding the full situation, Vincent's heart pounded. The joy was brief, quickly replaced by fear. What kind of major incident had his naive son caused?

"Let's have a meal first. It would be better to discuss the details afterward."

True to his character, Bishop curtly ended the matter and turned away.

The family head's attitude wasn't particularly friendly. However, the mere fact that a member of the 2nd-rank nobility used respectful language toward commoners revealed the mindset of parents whose youngest son was essentially being held hostage.

Even after the family members left, Vincent remained frozen in place for a while. Only when Shirone smiled and tugged at his collar did he snap out of it and head to the living room.

'Is it really true? Our Shirone? With the Ozent family?'

Everything was a question mark. Every question was astonishing. Olina, frightened like a little girl, clung tightly to her husband's arm. But even Vincent's legs were trembling.

Then he hastily pulled himself together. If Shirone's words were true, he could no longer show weakness. He had to hold his ground for his son's sake.

What was merely a meal for hospitality felt like a battlefield to Vincent.

Various delicacies were laid out on the rectangular table. Even Vincent, a hunter, had never seen some of these dishes before. These were ingredients that Reina had procured from the royal palace.

The seating followed protocol according to hierarchy. Bishop, the family head, sat at the head of the table, with Clump on his left and Reina on his right.

Vincent, sitting at the lowest seat, finally grasped reality upon seeing the exquisite foods spread before him. When Head Butler Lewis and Assistant Butler Temuran showed him proper courtesy, his shoulders unconsciously straightened with pride.

But he couldn't simply be pleased. Thinking of his son's dignity, he needed to finish the meal quietly, but seeing the seven different types of utensils made his head spin.

Commoners could grab a single fork and have no problem devouring an entire wild boar.

But the utensils before him were all different sizes and shapes, with some tools he'd never seen before in his life.

The meal began, but Vincent's family still couldn't take their first bite. The biggest problem was that the servants just stood there without any intention of helping.

There was no need for reckless moves in this precarious psychological warfare between nobles and commoners. Moreover, there was mockery and ridicule mixed in, as commoners had suddenly risen in status overnight.

Bishop set down his utensils and spoke.

"Please eat. There's no need to follow noble etiquette."

"B-but still..."

"I believe courtesy lies not in actions, but in the heart that wants to show those actions. Just by seeing your current difficulty, our family feels sufficient courtesy, so please eat comfortably."

Vincent was moved by the family head's words. Whether it was consideration or noble pride, showing such care was a great kindness.

The servants' faces turned pale. The Ozent family's attitude toward Shirone was genuine. They truly intended to accept Shirone.

The flustered servants hurriedly explained how to use the utensils. Really, the problem was not knowingâ€”once you knew, how difficult could eating be? Vincent's family, having reasonably figured things out, finally ate comfortably.

Having regained his composure, Vincent now worried about his son. What exactly did this family intend to do with Shirone?

Though he'd heard an explanation of what a knight's oath was, nothing would really change. Shirone was still a mountain man's child, and besides being more clever than others, no future was guaranteed for him.

Could there be some ulterior motive? He hated to suspect people who had shown kindness, but when it came to his child, Vincent would stop at nothing.

"Thank you for looking favorably upon my son, but I'm also worried. Isn't the Ozent family considered the most prestigious noble house in Creas? It's hard to believe that a young master from such a family would make a knight's oath with Shirone."

"Haha! You don't need to worry about that. Shirone and I..."

Bishop cut off Rian's words.

"To be honest, I do feel somewhat displeased."

All the utensils in the room stopped moving at once. But Bishop continued speaking while still cutting his food.

"However, it's a knight's oath. In warrior families, it's the pride and conviction with the strongest binding force. If I were to feel displeasure simply because of differences in social status, I believe that would be defiling Rian's pride instead. Therefore, I will continue to use respectful language, so please don't feel too uncomfortable."

Bishop's words resonated deeply with Shirone. Most nobles were arrogant and self-absorbed. But precisely because of this, the value of the pride they worshipped was beyond imagination.

Nobles had always been seen as oppressors of the people. But actually observing their way of life and conversing with them, he realized they too were people who moved according to their own rules.

"Heh heh heh, our family head is speaking sensibly for once. I suppose he's feeling lonely about sending away his remaining son too? Why don't you just send him next year instead?"

Bishop didn't fall for his father's provocation.

"Rai has learned Schema and mastered Ozent swordsmanship, so his chances of getting certified are high. On the other hand, Rian hasn't even grasped Schema yet. We have no choice but to pin our hopes on this swordsmanship school."

"I hear you're subtly taking the black-hair's side. The black hair of coldness, indeed. But the blue bloodline contains youth that hasn't withered. Don't underestimate the passion of blue hair, or you might face embarrassment later."

Rian, chewing on lamb, gave his grandfather a thumbs up. Bishop snorted. He was truly fed up with his father's mischievousness.

"Whether blue-haired or black-haired, whoever succeeds is my child. And that is precisely..."

All the direct family members set down their utensils and spoke in unison:

"Ozent."

* * *

After finishing dinner, Clump called the family members to the living room. It was to discuss Shirone's matters.

Reina reported in the family meeting that Shirone was interested in magic, and everyone agreed. Whether by build or temperament, there were limits to swordsmanship.

As it turned out, summoning Vincent had been the right thing to do. Unlike the relatively harmonious dinner atmosphere, Clump wore a stern expression as he announced:

"As you know, our family intends to support Shirone going forward. I hear he wants to become a mage, so how about sending him to Alpheas Magic School here in Creas? Principal Alpheas has been a long-time acquaintance of mine, and the school is among the top five prestigious institutions in the Kingdom of Tormia. As a kingdom-designated institution, graduates can even obtain unofficial certifications. In other words, he can become a mage."

"A... mage..."

Vincent gulped. A mage was the crystallization of intelligence and master of phenomena. It was a very special profession unrelated to social status, and once you obtained certification, you became a talent among talents, valued anywhere.

In the world, there were wild practitioners who awakened to magic on their own, and commoners who gained the fortune of becoming a mage's disciple and learned magic. Such people could also become mercenaries or join associations to obtain mage certifications.

But these cases were extremely rare, and for most commoners, being a mage was merely a profession from a distant land that didn't even appear in dreams.

But Shirone becoming a mage? And enrolling in a prestigious school where graduation immediately granted certification? As a father, it was an offer he absolutely couldn't refuse.

Olina burst into tears of emotion. Shirone embraced his mother. It was a heartwarming scene to anyone watching, but only Clump's expression was surprisingly dark.

Enrolling in magic school was certainly the fastest path to becoming a mage.

But the problem was Shirone's social status. Magic schools strictly allowed enrollment mainly for nobles, and special admissions were as difficult as plucking stars from the sky.

This would be no easy task even with the influence of the Ozent family, a 2nd-rank noble house. After all, magic schools had students from not only 2nd-rank but even 1st-rank noble families.

"As you probably already know, Shirone's current social status doesn't meet the qualification requirements for entering magic school. Even if the family supports the enrollment fees and textbook costs, questions will inevitably arise about the admission method."

Vincent woke up from his dream. It had been such a sweet fantasy that he'd lost his mind enough to forget reality.

"Ah, of course. I understand. Yes... I see."

Vincent's voice was tinged with disappointment. There would be self-reproach too. His son, acknowledged by a noble family, couldn't enter school because of the lowly status his inadequate father had passed down.

"There is one method. No, I should say it's the only method."

At Clump's words, Vincent's head snapped up. Shirone was also paying attention, as this was the first he'd heard of it.

"I would like to... adopt Shirone as the Ozent family's adopted son."

Silence filled the living room.

Clump's proposal was essentially asking them to sell their child. Of course, it wasn't a bad proposal. A hunter's son would instantly transform into a son of the Ozent family.

Under normal circumstances, it would be unthinkably exceptional treatment. But the reason his lips wouldn't part readily was because it was a matter of blood ties.

Shirone could become a noble. But from that moment, Shirone would no longer be his son. His son would become someone else's son.

Vincent looked at Shirone. Somewhat annoyingly, his son's expression remained calm. He couldn't tell if it was because he thought it should naturally be accepted, or because he thought it was all nonsense.

"We held a family meeting and concluded this was the best method. There's one immature fellow among the cousins who doesn't have children yet. If we register him under that family registry, Shirone would also become a noble and could easily enroll in school. Of course, we have absolutely no desire to take your son away. It's merely a matter of paperwork, so family relationships won't change."

Just a matter of paperwork. Could it really be discussed so easily? Everything in this world was a matter of paperwork.

Honestly, he lacked confidence. He wasn't confident he wouldn't feel hurt watching Shirone registered as another family's son.

'Shirone, please say something. What judgment should this father make? What do you truly want?'

Vincent looked at Shirone with a miserable heart.

Then Shirone's brow furrowed. Vincent realized it was because his father's inability to answer was frustrating.

As everyone held back their words on such a sensitive matter, Reina stepped forward to ask.

"Shirone, what do you think? It's just registering paperwork. You can become a noble and achieve your dream. Of course, we'll always think of your current parents as your parents. Nothing will change."

Shirone's brow furrowed even more and his eyes narrowed. Then he spoke as if he couldn't understand at all.
