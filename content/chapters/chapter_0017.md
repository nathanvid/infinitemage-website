"Of course that's absurd. I am my father's son. I would never become someone else's adopted child."

"Sh-Shirone."

Vincent's voice trembled with emotion. There was no hesitation in his son's tone. No, it was rather a tone that suggested he was displeased at even being made to say such things.

The Ozent family members were also taken aback by Shirone's resolute attitude.

Of course, it was a difficult matter. But to answer so clearly meant there wasn't even a trace of conflict in his heart.

Clump looked at Shirone with cold, calculating eyes, different from before.

"Are you really sure about this? This is an excellent opportunity to become a noble. It's not fortune that comes to just anyone."

"If I have to change fathers, I'd rather live as a commoner."

"Commoners cannot enroll in magic school."

"Then I won't enroll in magic school."

"If you don't enroll in magic school, you cannot become a mage."

"Then I won't become a mage."

"Shirone!"

Clump shot up with blazing eyes. He was frustrated by Shirone's stubborn attitude. This child who was usually so sharp-minded—why was he being so obstinate about such a simple matter?

"Is this because of guilt? The world isn't so accommodating. For success, there are things you must give up. Or was your dream such a trivial thing after all?"

The massive Clump was intimidating just to look up at. But Shirone answered calmly, as always.

"Perhaps it is."

"What?"

"No matter how great my dream may be, that too is something inherited from my parents. My parents are the roots that supplied nutrients to the fruit that is me and allowed me to dream. The fact that I could seize this opportunity with the Ozent family, that I could enter as a servant before that, that I could learn to read before that—all of this was possible because of the roots that are my parents. The single opportunity given to me now is nothing compared to the infinite opportunities my parents have given me until now. To deny those roots now and tell me to move forward by receiving nutrients from different roots—that's no different from telling me to wither and die."

The living room fell silent. But storms were raging in everyone's hearts. Reina wiped away tears, and Rian smiled with pride in his friend.

Clump's eyes, looking down at Shirone, wavered.

'How can such a child exist...?'

He was the one who had been mistaken. Had he been thinking wrong from the beginning? Even without anyone's help, wouldn't this child eventually become a mage?

Great. No, infinite. Even the honor of the Ozent family was just one passing opportunity for this child.

No one could hold onto this child. Not until the child chose to hold onto them first.

Only after convincing everyone did Shirone smile.

"I'm grateful for the offer. But I cannot accept it. My parents are only these two people sitting here right now."

Vincent clenched his fists. He was ashamed. He wanted to crawl under the sofa right then and there. What was a mere piece of paper anyway, that he should feel hurt by it? When his son trusted him like this. A parent who had given nothing—to think he would feel hurt by such a thing.

"Please... accept Shirone as an adopted child of the Ozent family."

"Father."

Vincent squeezed his eyes shut.

"Please accept Shirone as your adopted child! I beg of you!"

No one thought Vincent was a inadequate parent. They would have done the same thing if it were their family's matter.

"I understand your feelings, but it can't be helped. When a child says such things, how can we ignore his heart?"

"Shirone... Shirone is actually not our child."

"Dear!"

Everyone's eyes widened at Vincent's statement. But the most surprised was Shirone himself.

It wasn't just because of the secret of his birth. In fact, anyone here would have vaguely suspected it. Just looking at appearance and build, Shirone was completely different from his parents.

But this statement was an issue of father-son relationship incomparable to any paperwork. For his child's dream, Vincent was truly prepared to give up being a father.

"My wife and I cannot have children. Shirone is a child we came to have by chance. As you can see from living with him, he's surely a noble's child. He's too good a son for me. If he becomes a noble's adopted child, it would rather be finding his rightful place, so it wouldn't be denying his roots."

Since it made sense when they thought about it, everyone pondered deeply.

But as if shattering their thoughts, Shirone cried out with a hurt expression.

"Dad!"

"Sh-Shirone?"

"What are you doing right now? To say such things without even consulting me! You never said anything like that before!"

"I'm sorry, Shirone. The reason I didn't tell you was..."

"Do you know why I never asked? Because everyone has only one father. Only one mother too. Just how many parents are you trying to give me? Because of you, I'm already on the verge of having six!"

Vincent was shocked. Two from the adoptive family, two including themselves, and two who abandoned Shirone—that made six in total. When he thought about it that way, he realized how ridiculous what he was doing to his child was.

"I-I was just sad that you might give up your dream because of me..."

"Who's giving up their dream? There are plenty of opportunities in life! Do you know what it feels like to be abandoned by your parents twice?"

Tears welled up in Shirone's eyes.

Only then did Vincent realize. Because the child was smart and thoughtful, he had forgotten. That his son was only seventeen years old.

"Shirone, I'm sorry! What has this father done! I will never hand you over to others. I will definitely help you achieve your dream!"

"Dad!"

When Vincent embraced him tightly, Shirone finally wiped his tears and burrowed into his father's arms. How frightened he must have been. How hurt this deep-hearted child who couldn't even show his feelings must have been.

The Ozent family members watched the father and son's reunion warmly. The one whose heart was most moved was the family head, Bischoff. He too was a father who had raised four children alone after losing his wife early.

Bischoff quietly instructed Clump.

"It seems there's no choice but for grandfather to lend his strength."

"You're giving all sorts of orders to this old geezer. How can I lend strength? Even cunning scholarly families give up when faced with Alpheas's stubbornness."

Clump groaned and shook his head. But he seemed to have something to rely on, as his expression wasn't too bad.

"Then I'll have to give an order as the family head. Let's try to break through this special admission thing. I hear there are some old debts."

"Hmph! That old geezer owes me more than one or two favors. The problem is he's not the type to bend his principles."

"Is it absolutely impossible?"

"Heh heh. Who knows? For someone who sticks to principles, isn't the bulldozer approach a special remedy?"

Bischoff smiled silently. He remembered his own situation of being forced to become family head because of that bulldozer approach.

* * *

Shirone stayed with the Ozent family until the day Rian left. Whether he would pass the special admission was uncertain, but even if he did pass, enrollment would be early next year, so he had six whole months left to spend with his parents.

An elegant four-horse carriage waited at the main gate of the Ozent mansion. It was the carriage that would take the family members to the royal castle.

Rai was already aboard, and Clump planned to meet Alpheas, the headmaster of the magic school, then join them at a midpoint.

Rian, reluctant to part with Shirone, showed tears. Whether magic school or swordsmanship school, there was no set duration for completion. If you didn't pass the graduation exam, you had to attend school for years, so there was no telling when they would meet again after this parting.

"Shirone, you must become a mage! I'll write letters!"

"Got it. It's not like we'll never meet again, and you can come back sometimes. Stop crying already."

"You'll definitely be able to graduate! I guarantee it!"

Reina knocked her immature brother on the head and said,

"You better think about graduating yourself! I'm most worried about you!"

"Ugh! I'll work hard too! I'll definitely become the strongest knight and be Shirone's sword."

Shirone didn't doubt those words for a moment. Rian would do well. He didn't have the same genius as Rai, but Rian had countless things that Rai didn't possess.

Reina patted Shirone's head and said,

"Shirone, don't worry and enjoy time with your family for now. Grandfather will definitely get you enrolled. He doesn't make empty promises."

"Yes. And... thank you for helping me."

Shirone spoke from the heart. No matter how much he had become friends with Rian, without Reina's assistance, things wouldn't have turned out this well.

Reina suddenly realized she didn't want to part with Shirone. Though he was four years younger, he didn't seem young because he was such an outstanding person.

"Shirone, when you graduate from magic school..."

Reina was about to say something, then just laughed it off. He was a seventeen-year-old boy with a bright future. When he went to magic school, he would interact with countless talented people incomparably more than now.

"Never mind. Let's both work hard. You'll definitely be able to become a mage."

"Yes. Please take good care of Rian."

"Heh heh, don't worry. He even made a knight's oath, so he'll work hard without nagging."

Reina looked back at Shirone one last time and got into the carriage. The moment the four horses stamped their feet, the window opened and Rian stuck his face out.

"Shirone, you're the best! When you get into magic school, smash them all!"

"You too! You must graduate!"

Thus ended his year and six months of servant life.

Now that it was actually over, sadness washed over him like leaving home.

Even the great straight road of the Ozent family, which had intimidated him when he first arrived, now felt like a symbol wishing him good fortune.

"Young master, shall we go? I'll escort you home."

A carriage to take Shirone home was waiting. Seeing it, he finally felt the reality of going home.

Shirone bowed his head toward the Ozent family mansion.

"Thank you so very much."

Alpheas Magic School.

Around noon when classes were in full swing, two old men sat facing each other in the headmaster's office, drinking tea.

A blue-haired man boasting a large build and a man with a gentle smile, sitting slightly hunched while gazing out the window.

They were fifty-year friends, Mirhi Alpheas and Ozent Clump.

Their conversation had been cut off for thirty minutes. More precisely, Clump was waiting for Alpheas's answer.

No matter how long it took, it didn't matter. Since it was Alpheas's turn to answer, Clump wasn't saying a word.

"Even you cannot ask me to grant such a request."

For an answer that came after thirty minutes, it was rather deflating. But Clump grinned.

Though he had drawn out time as if making a difficult decision, he had probably been thinking about nothing at all. The Alpheas he knew was such a prankster.

"Even me? Do you know how much trouble I went through because of you when we were young?"

"Hah hah! For empty words to come from your mouth, you must be quite desperate. However, I didn't create the special admission to become a backdoor for nobles. Countless requests come in every year, but special admission has its own conditions."

"Heh heh, that's interesting. A backdoor for nobles. But this time will be different, won't it?"

Alpheas felt slightly uneasy. Clump's eyes were full of mischief—it seemed he had brought another troublesome matter.

"I'm not asking you to accept some worthless brat. Rather the opposite. There's a friend of my youngest grandson who's very talented. It's like seeing you in your youth."

At the mention of something from over fifty years ago, Alpheas's eyes became distant. Come to think of it, so much time had already passed.

"Your youngest grandson—you mean the thoughtless and obstinate Rian? He was just like you in childhood."

"Heh heh heh! He had no talent, so I stuck him in swordsmanship school. Anyway, let that brat handle himself—what I want to talk about is Rian's friend."

"If he's so talented, wouldn't it be fine for him to enroll normally? I can only think there's a problem."

"There is a very big problem. He's not a noble."

Alpheas's eyes widened greatly. Not because he was being asked to take in a non-noble. A brief moment from five years ago flashed through his mind.

"Don't tell me... a boy with blonde hair and blue eyes?"
