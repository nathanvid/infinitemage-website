This time it was Clump who was surprised. As always, he was someone who knew how to toy with people.

"They say that when you reach enlightenment in magic, you gain the power of foresight."

"It's nothing like that. We had a brief connection, though it was quite intense."

Alpheas introduced his encounter with twelve-year-old Shirone. Then Clump told him about what had happened after Shirone joined the Ozent household.

"Arian Shirone."

Alpheas fell silent again. But this time he was truly lost in thought.

"Why don't you just accept him? This might be fate too, you know?"

"Fate is nothing but wordplay. Humans pioneer their own futures. If you try to attach meaning to everything, what wouldn't be fate?"

Still not getting through? Clump clicked his tongue.

But part of him felt pained. He could imagine his friend's feelings—discovering good talent but being unable to make a decision.

"Are you still... unable to forgive yourself?"

Alpheas remained silent.

"Isn't that why you opened special admissions despite the nobles' opposition? You've done enough. You've produced countless talented individuals. It's time to forgive yourself."

"Heh heh heh, forgiving oneself would be arrogance. I'm someone who threw God-given precious talent into the trash. It's not about seeking forgiveness. I just hope no one like that appears again."

Clump sighed. Though he was a certified 4th-grade mage and headmaster of a prestigious school, this friend wasn't someone who should end up at just this level. He had been a genius. If not for that day's incident.

"Keke. Well, you were pretty insufferable back then, even from a friend's perspective. The light of the Mirhi family. A once-in-a-century genius is now just an old headmaster. Life is truly fleeting."

Perhaps pain becomes like a child you embrace as you age—even at the sharp words that pierced his heart, Alpheas felt good.

"Kekeke! On the other hand, heaven helped you. That talentless fool is now a certified 3rd-grade swordsman. I'm worried about the Kingdom of Tormia's future."

Both men burst into hearty laughter. In the battle between talent and effort, those natural enemies, Clump could be said to have won. Alpheas was proud of and respected such a friend.

"It's a thought that comes with age, but genius is nothing but delusion. It's just being a little good at something. I wonder if that boy can truly comfort me?"

"Don't you know that better than anyone?"

Alpheas chuckled and walked to the window. So it comes to this after all. Would talent that had to be sent away due to class barriers appear before him again after taking a five-year detour?

He believed there was no such thing as fate in the world. Only humans could pioneer their own futures.

But Alpheas suddenly felt goosebumps. Could it really be... fate?

"I'll admit Shirone to the school."

Learning Magic (1)

Spring arrived. Flowers bloomed abundantly in Vincent's cottage garden too.

During the six months after his magic school admission was confirmed, Shirone spent happy times with his parents.

Since he would live in dormitories once he entered school, he wanted to do as many things as possible with his family.

He went logging with his father, and when they returned home, he would share conversations over delicious dinners his mother prepared.

Vincent didn't tell anyone about Shirone's success. Though his mouth itched to boast to friends who had looked down on him for having a weak son, he didn't want to create unnecessary enemies that might trouble Shirone.

Shirone was grateful for such a father. The reason he firmly refused even the Ozent family's offer to provide a house in the city was purely parental love—not wanting to burden their child.

Happy days flew by like arrows, and finally the day to enter magic school arrived.

While assistant butler Temuran waited outside with a carriage, Shirone bid farewell to his parents.

"Father, I'll be back. I'll write often."

"Yes, my son! Work hard! Come here for a kiss!"

When Vincent puckered his lips, Shirone's smile stiffened. No matter how young he looked, kissing his father at eighteen was rather embarrassing.

"Father, even so, kisses are a bit much now."

"Hey! If not, daddy will do it!"

"Ugh."

As his father approached with thick lips puckered, Shirone shrank back. But Vincent kissed Shirone's forehead warmly instead of his lips and pulled him into an embrace.

"Shirone, I'm proud of you."

Embraced in Vincent's arms, Shirone felt even the last traces of anxiety in his heart disappear.

"I'll be going now."

Leaving the house with the same greeting as always, Temuran was waiting in front of the stable.

"Please get in. I've been ordered to escort you to the school."

"Yes, thank you."

The two men didn't speak until they arrived at the school. It was true that they felt uncomfortable since their positions had reversed in just two years.

But Shirone hadn't forgotten. Even under head butler Luis's interference, Temuran had taken his side.

Arriving at the magic school's main gate, Temuran courteously helped Shirone alight. Since this was a place nobles attended, he had to be mindful of others' gazes.

"Tuition and textbook fees will be paid through me. Don't worry about financial matters, young master, and just study hard."

Shirone showed the same courtesy to Temuran.

"Assistant butler, I'm truly grateful."

"I'm just doing what I must."

"But I haven't properly thanked you yet. Thanks to your favorable view of me, I was able to enter magic school. I won't forget this kindness."

Temuran thought for a moment, then spoke.

"No matter how much a commoner flies and leaps, they're still just a commoner. They cannot look down on nobles."

When Shirone raised his head, Temuran's eyes flashed sharply as he continued.

"But such opportunities aren't given to just anyone either. Probably many nobles will view you unfavorably. Even so, endure and endure again. If you can endure to the end, there will eventually be an end."

It was advice befitting Temuran, who had risen to assistant butler from orphan origins. Truth lies in simple places. If you can endure to the end, there will eventually be an end.

"Thank you. I will definitely become a mage."

Temuran smiled. It was the first time Shirone had seen his smile in two years of living together.

"If you're resolved, please follow me. You are registered as a guest of the Ozent family and have entered through special admissions. Let me introduce you."

At the magic school's main gate stood guards just like six years ago. Shirone couldn't tell if it was the same guard who had chased him away like a bug, but even if the people changed, the philosophy of that position would remain the same.

"What business do you have?"

"This is Lord Shirone, who's entering magic school this time. Here are his enrollment certificate and identity verification documents from the Ozent family."

The guard who checked the enrollment certificate didn't even dare look at the identity documents.

In any case, since this person could cross this threshold, he was clearly someone of much higher status than themselves.

"Ah, I see. It's an honor to serve you. I'm Marco, in charge of the main gate guard. Please treat me favorably going forward."

When the guard bowed, the guard standing beside him also placed his right arm on his stomach and saluted respectfully.

Shirone was dumbfounded by the completely different treatment from six years ago, but soon grasped reality and smiled.

"Well then, I'll be going. Please seek me out anytime you need anything."

Receiving the documents from Temuran, Shirone took his first step as a magic school student.

The moment he crossed the main gate's threshold, his heart swelled. Alpheas Magic School, called the cradle of geniuses. What would he learn and what kind of people would he meet?

Mage Shirone's life was just beginning.

* * *

The magic school used an entire mountain of 75.425 square kilometers. There were twenty-two buildings total and over forty basic training grounds alone.

The total student body was 420 with thirty-two teachers. With this scale, it could truly be called the kingdom's best school without shame.

Entering the building with the reception desk, neat and beautiful students were walking around in groups of three to five.

Various maps, founding history, and curricula were posted on the walls. While submitting documents and waiting, Shirone spent time carefully examining them all.

Alpheas Magic School adopted a system called Class Ten. Ten to Eight Class were basic levels, Seven to Four Class were advanced levels, and Three to One Class were graduating levels.

The graduating level, which uniquely applied relative evaluation, had a maximum of thirty students, of which only ten would graduate.

Shirone was astounded by Alpheas's strict graduation system. Considering that graduation tests were held only once a year, it meant twenty talented individuals were expelled annually.

"So you're Shirone."

Magic school headmaster Alpheas personally came to find Shirone.

Shirone was flustered by his appearance, unchanged from six years ago. But considering this was a magic school that destroyed common sense, it wasn't that surprising.

"Hello. I'm Shirone."

"I think we've met before? Do you remember me?"

How could he not remember? It was the incident that first made Shirone dream of becoming a mage.

"Yes. I was truly grateful then."

"Good. Anyway, we'll talk more later—let's go for now. You need to take an entrance test."

Shirone was flustered to hear he had to take a test immediately upon enrollment. What kind of test could there be when he hadn't learned anything yet?

"Don't worry. It's an evaluation to determine your class. Can you do Spirit Zone?"

"Yes, I can."

"Ho! Is that so?"

He knew the boy was talented and intelligent. But even so, mastering Spirit Zone alone was difficult.

Actually, it was Alpheas himself who had taught Shirone Spirit Zone, but he hadn't thought a twelve-year-old child would succeed after just one attempt.

That thought remained the same now. He had scheduled Shirone's admission last among the incoming students for that reason.

Since countless families started magic training from birth, many incoming students were under ten years old. No matter how old, none exceeded fourteen.

Therefore, he had adjusted the timing so eighteen-year-old Shirone wouldn't lose face.

'I'll have to teach from the basics. It's partly my fault for poor judgment, but what a waste. It would have been good if he'd started just a little earlier.'

Alpheas guided Shirone to the testing ground. Since the other children's tests would be in full swing if they arrived now, his pace was leisurely.

Entering the building with the intention of giving him a tour, Shirone's mouth fell open. A completely different world from anything he'd seen before spread out.

Countless students were using magic. Even though it was the basic level building, the children's extraordinary feats dazzled the eyes.

A girl floating at the fourth-floor height was conversing with a friend through a window, while another child was reading three books spread simultaneously in midair.

Alpheas glanced at Shirone's reaction and smiled like a mischievous child. From now on, it would be a different dimension.

Entering Class Seven, the students' age range jumped up significantly. Though they didn't use strange magic like children, their eyes were full of intelligence and they were so absorbed in conversation they wouldn't notice anyone passing by.

"Convection energy enough to bring the atmosphere below freezing? Wouldn't it be more efficient to condense coolant instead?"

"But there's the disadvantage of not being able to promote reversible reactions. How about this? Instead of reversing energy directionality, if we rotate the time axis..."

Shirone was frightened listening to the students' conversation. He couldn't understand what topic they were discussing at all.

At that moment, intense noise came from the end of the corridor. A door was torn off and a female student ran out covering her ears.

Students looked around with surprised expressions for a moment but quickly returned to normal. From their reactions, this seemed to be something that happened frequently here.

The female student covering her ears spotted Alpheas and called out cheerfully.

"Ah, Headmaster! Hello!"

"Hehe, yes. Looks like there's been a problem."

"It's a sound amplification experiment, but there seems to be an error in the output circuit. I think I need to redo the design."

"Balancing input and output is important. The key is maintaining electrical force evenly."

"Yes, I'll try again."

The female student adjusted her glasses and entered the laboratory. Children her age were gathered around a strange magic circle having discussions.

Shirone realized how small a well he had been trapped in. Everyone seemed like geniuses.

The status board showed the grades of 270 advanced level students in a long list. Class Four, the highest in the advanced level, had forty-two students registered, and first place was a name called Carmis Amy.

'Wow. As expected, the Carmis family is first.'

Based on his experience working for the Ozent family, Shirone had memorized famous noble families. Carmis was a first-rank noble family with their main house in Creas city.

But Shirone wasn't intimidated from the start. It was truly infinite competition. He wanted to compete. He wanted to challenge himself to see how high he could climb.

"Hey, Amy! Let's go together!"

Shirone turned his head. They definitely said Amy. It was a chance to see the Class Four first-place student with his own eyes. A beautiful red-haired girl was holding books and waiting for her friend.

"Huh?"

Shirone's heart suddenly raced. Trauma. Emotion came before memory. Only after a while did he recall who she was.

She was the girl who had bullied him in the back alley six years ago.
