'H-how can this be! Why is that child here?'

When Amy walked alongside her friend, Shirone turned his head away. It would be a disaster if she remembered him, since she knew he wasn't a noble.

'Please just pass by. Just walk past.'

The two female students passed by without any particular reaction.

Shirone let out a sigh of relief, but that was a hasty judgment born from not understanding women.

"Did you see that boy who just passed? Is he a new student? He seems too old to be a freshman. Maybe he's a transfer student? He's totally my type."

Despite her chatty friend's words, Amy remained silent. Like Shirone, she too was feeling something strange.

But it wasn't quite trauma. Having caused countless mischief in back alleys, she couldn't easily recall Shirone.

"Hmm, that's strange. He definitely looks familiar. Where have I seen him?"

"What, are you interested in him? You've never given any boy a second glance until now."

"No. I really have seen him somewhere."

"Don't lie! You're not being honest. You've fallen for him, haven't you? You have, right?"

"Oh, I really haven't."

Amy quickened her pace at the persistent questioning. When her friend walked even faster to catch up, Amy broke into a run. Male students around them watched Amy with pleased expressions.

Shirone was the only person who knew that the girl revered as a goddess at Alpheas Magic School had once been a troublemaker who ruled the back alleys.

Magic School. Third Examination Hall.

A massive auditorium had a mirror-smooth floor. Unknown characters were densely inscribed everywhere, and not a single chair was placed anywhere.

The only place with equipment was the north side of the auditorium. Five teachers sat in a row at a table placed crosswise.

Six children were taking tests while waiting their turn, most of them under ten years old.

"The test isn't finished yet. Perfect timing. Watch carefully how those children do it."

Shirone went to where the test was being conducted. The children waiting their turn looked at Shirone with puzzled expressions as they concentrated.

Traditionally, the Third Examination Hall that tested Spirit Zone only conducted entrance exams except in special cases. However, Shirone's age was too advanced to become a new student.

Alpheas had told Shirone that when one entered the Zone, the characters carved into the floor transmitted special information. Depending on what one saw there, the teachers would check the size, intensity, flexibility, and tendencies of the Spirit Zone.

"Alright, Kemy. Can you use magic?"

"I can make objects float in the air."

The examiners didn't verify each claim individually. There was no point in bragging at a school you came to learn at—you'd only be hurting yourself in the end.

"I see. Then shall we try entering the Spirit Zone right away?"

Kemy entered the Spirit Zone under the full attention of the examiners' gazes. The teacher sitting on the right rested his chin on the back of his hand and watched intently. He was a neat-looking man with slicked-back hair and deep double eyelids.

"What's the farthest number you can see?"

"Six."

"Oh! Six, you say."

The man exclaimed in admiration and recorded the number on his documents. This meant the Spirit Zone had a diameter of six meters. For an entering student to have this size was at least Class Nine level.

It was the turn of the elderly teacher sitting next to him to ask a question. With closely cropped hair and wrinkles covering his forehead, he habitually widened his eyes, making him look like an owl.

"What color do you feel most vividly?"

"Um... it feels like I'm in a red world."

"Red, you say. Emission type. It makes sense that the Zone is wide for his age."

The teachers nodded at the old man's words. The third and fourth teachers also asked questions in their respective specialties.

The question about whether a giant tower stood on the right or left was to determine whether one primarily used the right or left brain hemisphere, and the question about how many balls were shaking around was to measure the Zone's density.

"What temperature do you feel right now? Is it on the hot side or the cold side?"

The teacher who asked the final question was a young woman. Her eyebrows were sharply thin and her eyes were elongated, giving her a cold impression, but her appearance was quite attractive.

"Um... it seems a bit hot. I'm even sweating."

Feeling heat meant the Spirit Zone's form was variable. However, the more variable it was, the lower the durability, so it wasn't necessarily good or bad.

The remaining students took their tests in this manner. The teachers looked satisfied, as if the level was quite high.

When one child called out the number twelve, even Alpheas, the principal, couldn't help but be impressed.

All students finished their tests and it became Shirone's turn. Alpheas gently pushed the nervous Shirone's back and brought him to the teachers.

"Now, don't feel pressured and show us what you can do."

"Yes, I'll try."

Shirone wasn't burdened. From the moment he decided to enter this place, he had resolved to study from the basics.

When the tall boy entered, the examiners looked at Shirone carefully. He was the special admission student the principal had informed them about in advance.

His resume listed the unique status of "guest of the Ozent family," and under special remarks, it said he had high potential for development.

Sometimes there were children like this—those who accidentally unlocked their abilities later in life.

But this was a magic school called the cradle of geniuses. No matter how much they were praised as geniuses outside, countless children became poor students the moment they came here. Perhaps because of this, the teachers didn't have particular expectations.

The slicked-back man sitting on the right asked in an indifferent voice. Fire mage Saad. The only targets he felt favorable toward were women.

"Arian Shirone. Eighteen years old. Can you use magic?"

"No. I haven't learned magic yet."

"I see. Well, you should be able to do a few things even without learning."

Saad's tone contained mockery. Of course, his words had merit. Spirit Zone served as a passage that drew knowledge from one's mind into reality.

Therefore, noble children who studied various subjects from a young age often cast simple magic on their own.

But for Shirone, who had no opportunity to learn academics, this was impossible. Knowing this weakness, he had devoted himself to the spine of knowledge above all else, but the truth was that his knowledge applicable to magic was still shallow.

"Fine. Let's see once. Stand in that circle and try Spirit Zone. Ah, you can do Spirit Zone, right?"

If he couldn't even enter Spirit Zone while being admitted through special admission, Saad was thinking of questioning the principal's morality.

Fortunately, Shirone nodded and headed toward the circle, so there was no need for unnecessary suspicion.

Shirone closed his eyes and concentrated. As his ego faded, countless sensations extended outward.

'Wow...'

Shirone, who entered the Zone, was overwhelmed by the vast information. It felt like he had fallen into another dimensional world rather than an examination hall.

Most information was blocked within the phase space. All he could feel was the interaction of magic characters carved into the floor.

"What's the farthest number you can see?"

Countless numbers were orbiting. Shirone focused on the farthest visible number. Since it worked through synesthesia rather than sight, whether one could see or not didn't matter.

But Shirone couldn't answer.

"Shirone, what's the farthest number you can see?"

Even when Saad urged him, Shirone's mouth didn't open. The teachers thought he was being shy. It was natural to feel intimidated after seeing the young children's abilities.

Alpheas spoke in a kind voice.

"Shirone, just be honest. We're not ranking you, but trying to find the educational method suitable for you."

Shirone spoke in an uncertain voice.

"Um... I can see numbers, but they're too long to read."

"Too long to read? Do you mean you can't see them?"

"No. I can see them, but they're too long. They're getting longer right now too."

Saad was annoyed. The magic formula that calculated Zone size only transmitted integers. He thought Shirone was rambling and stalling for time because he was embarrassed that his insufficient skill was being revealed.

"Then just tell us roughly the numbers in front."

"Um, 3.14."

The teachers' eyes widened greatly. The number Shirone was seeing was pi. Since it was an irrational number that couldn't be divided into integers, it was extending infinitely.

The woman sitting on the left pushed up her glasses and snapped. Ice magic's Shiina. True to her magical tendency, she had a cold personality and was Saad's rival teacher.

"Shirone, I'm sorry, but there's no 3.14 among the numbers we designated. Are you really certain?"

Shirone frowned as if troubled.

"Um. Is that so? But that's what I see."

'It's real...'

Shiina had lied. Of course, pi wasn't recorded in the magic characters carved into the floor. There was only one case when pi would appear.

When the Zone's range exceeded the measurable scope.

This meant that the diameter of Shirone's Zone was at least 30 meters or more.

The measurement precision of the Third Examination Hall for evaluating new students was set quite low. This was because showing immature young children intense landscapes, experiencing scorching heat, or Arctic cold could cause psychological shock.

As part of this, the range for measuring Spirit Zone diameter was also limited to 30 meters.

But even for late admission, not many people exceeded this threshold. A Zone with a diameter of 30 meters or more was at least Class Five level.

The old man sitting next to Saad asked a question.

"What color do you feel most vividly?"

"Um, blue. Everything is dyed blue."

The old man's lips protruded. Murmuring sounds began among the teachers.

Blue tones meant convergence type. A category that had advantages in durability rather than Spirit Zone size.

Yet if the Spirit Zone's diameter exceeded 30 meters, it certainly wasn't slow growth for his age.

Alpheas was also in continuous amazement. He finally seemed to understand why Clump had made such bold claims.

But being a mage by nature, he became rather critical.

If it were moderate talent, he would have thought to praise him, but Shirone was already exceeding that level. Moreover, it was incomplete talent that hadn't yet touched the realm of magic.

This was dangerous. Praising him too much could ruin his entire life.

Shirone answered the following questions. His brain development was bilateral, using both left and right hemispheres simultaneously.

This was also characteristic, but what was truly noteworthy came in the next question.

"How many balls are floating around?"

Since he experienced synesthesia, there was no need to count them one by one. Just like feeling when something touched his skin, he could sense the number of balls all at once.

Shirone remained silent for a moment, then opened his mouth.

"867."

"867..."

The teacher who had asked the question unconsciously muttered.

Even Shiina, who had been watching with a cold attitude until now, pulled her chair closer and sat properly for the first time.

Zone density was a category that measured how evenly mental power was spread.

Sensing 867 balls meant that Shirone's mental power was filling the Zone with a density of 86.7 percent.

Even density meant that much mental stability, and if so, the success rate of magic would inevitably increase.
