"Shirone, how cold do you feel right now?"

Siena had already assumed that Shirone belonged to the cold side and posed her question accordingly.

As expected, Shirone gave her the answer she wanted.

"It's quite cold. No, it's more like freezing."

Anyway, in Test Room 3, it was impossible to feel anything colder than a chilly sensation. Siena nodded knowingly and wrote up her overall assessment.

The gist was this: convergent type, defensive, with excellent durability. However, even so, the size of his Zone was abnormally large.

Siena wondered if such cases existed. She had been teaching for over four years, but it was rare to encounter students whose mental tendencies revealed completely opposite traits.

However, this was an inevitable result of Shirone's selective focus and concentration. Just as he had devoted himself solely to history books to overcome his lack of broad knowledge, his relentless practice of the Spirit Zone alone in an environment where he couldn't learn magic had created this exceptional foundation.

"Thank you for your hard work. You may come out of the Spirit Zone now. We need to have a meeting to determine your class, so could you please wait outside for a moment?"

"Yes. Thank you."

Shirone emerged from the Spirit Zone, bowed politely, and headed outside where young children were gathered together.

As soon as the test room door closed, the teachers began voicing their opinions.

"Quite an unusual student indeed."

Thad retorted with displeasure.

"Rather than unusual, wouldn't you say he's well-balanced?"

Siena said.

"He's unusual precisely because he's so well-balanced. An 18-year-old boy who knows no magic has a Zone with a diameter exceeding 30 meters. Despite being of convergent tendency."

"The larger the Zone, the thinner its density becomes. However, this student's density is still 86.7 percent."

"While we do teach students technical methods to increase density, this child achieved this figure purely through his own abilities. 86.7 percent represents the mental stability of a high monk practicing in the mountains."

As the teachers praised him unanimously, Thad became even more irritated. Magic was a realm of talent. Therefore, most mages had strong pride. To that extent, they sometimes felt jealous even of students.

"Even so, it's just student level. We should observe him more before making judgments."

"What do you mean by that? Student level? This is a school where students come to learn."

At Siena's cold voice, Thad's face reddened. If she hadn't been so pretty, he wouldn't have endured such humiliation.

Seeing signs of an emotional conflict brewing, the other professors kept quiet. Thad of flame magic and Siena of ice magic were famous rivals at the school.

Alpheas asked.

"So where would you like him placed? Shirone, I mean."

Siena was the first to offer her opinion.

"Wouldn't Class Five be appropriate? He has high potential for development, and because his tendencies are unusual, I think he needs intensive management."

Thad objected.

"But he doesn't know magic, does he? If we put him in Class Five, he might get cocky and just cause trouble."

"Some students might be like Teacher Thad, but not all students are like that."

Thad glared and stood up.

"Teacher Siena! There are limits to my patience! Honestly, isn't it that you want to manage him directly? Since you're the dedicated teacher for Class Five!"

"So what if I do? If a teacher wants to guide a student, is there some problem with that?"

"I'm saying your greed is excessive. He doesn't know magic and can't even transform his Zone. No matter how generously we assess him, Class Seven is appropriate."

Alpheas asked the other teachers for their opinions as well. Some teachers said it would be good to nurture him gradually starting from Class Ten, while others suggested postponing his placement for now and observing him.

An owl-like teacher proposed a compromise.

"I think Class Seven would be appropriate as well. Given his age, sending him to a beginner class might discourage his motivation, and Class Seven includes basic Spirit Zone classes, so wouldn't that be fine? If Shirone truly shows talent, early promotion would be possible too."

Alpheas also thought his words were correct. To perfect Shirone's half-complete talent, he needed an even more solid foundation.

"Then we'll proceed with that arrangement."

The entrance exam test was concluded.

* * *

Thanks to being assigned to Class Seven, Shirone was able to secure accommodation in the advanced class dormitory where his peers stayed.

Surprisingly, it was a private room. Since it was a school attended by nobility, they seemed to guarantee maximum convenience.

Shirone's room was Room 707 in the male dormitory.

Though it was a modest room for nobility, it was the size of the living room in the cabin where Shirone had lived. Bookshelves lined the walls, naturally empty.

The staff member who guided Shirone gave him simple guidelines. Classes ended at 5 PM, and it was free time afterward.

Going out was prohibited except on weekends, but since the campus was so vast, most convenience facilities were available on school grounds.

Students could form research groups in fields of interest, and if a certain number gathered, funding was provided.

Libraries in the four directions—north, south, east, and west—were open 24 hours, and as long as deadlines were met, there weren't many restrictions on the number of books that could be borrowed.

Shirone was satisfied with everything. It was the optimal environment for studying.

Finally, the staff member informed him of the prohibitions. Magic use after hours was strictly forbidden except in laboratories. Research into forbidden magic, in particular, could result in disciplinary action.

Typical forbidden magic included the necromancers' soul-calling arts, and Anti-Magic was also included among them.

Shirone asked why Anti-Magic was forbidden magic, but the staff member only said he didn't know and left.

Shirone lay on his bed and fell into thought. Since he hadn't learned anything yet, there would be no need to join research groups for a while.

'I should visit the library. I studied only history for two years, so from now on I need to acquire broad knowledge.'

Shirone was confident. Wasn't this the backbone of knowledge he had created by suppressing his curiosity for this very purpose? From now on, all that remained was to master all the knowledge in the world.

* * *

Shirone woke to the sound of piano music. It was ether resonance, a type of sound magic that spread the sound. It was pleasant playing, but it didn't match Reina's skill.

Shirone already missed her. Was Reina doing well? Had Rian also waited for his first class with a trembling heart like himself?

Unlike the dormitories where men and women were strictly separated, the dining hall was the only place within the dormitory where men and women could sit together.

Shirone sat in a corner spot and ate alone.

He had once been teased by the children of the slash-and-burn village because of such timid tendencies, but the students here didn't care how others ate their meals.

However, matters between men and women were an exception, so when pretty or handsome students entered, everyone without exception would look their way.

Shirone in particular was both a new face and exceptionally good-looking, making him the main object of interest among the female students.

Fleeing the girls' whispering sounds, Shirone finished his meal and returned to his room to pack his materials according to his schedule.

When he shouldered his bag, his shoulder ached from the weight of the books. Even Class Seven was still an advanced class, so there was an enormous amount to learn.

Classes were difficult. Compared to the nobles who thoroughly prepared and reviewed, Shirone's knowledge was very limited.

However, thanks to acquiring shallow but extensive knowledge through his backbone of knowledge, he was able to keep up to some degree.

If mornings were for learning theory, afternoons were for practical training. Advanced classes in particular proceeded with integrated classes for Spirit Zone training.

The sight of 280 students gathering in the training ground and dividing into seniors and juniors was spectacular from Shirone's perspective.

"Senior, thanks to what you taught me last time, I did well on the exam. Thank you."

"Senior, over here! I saved a spot for you!"

Having no acquaintances, Shirone observed how the students behaved. He often saw older students bowing their heads to younger students.

Whether officially recognized or not, once in society, positions were determined by grade level, so here too, barriers between seniors and juniors existed strictly in proportion to ability.

In other words, it was a microcosm of magical society.

Of course, yesterday's junior could become today's senior, but no senior refrained from treating juniors carelessly just because they feared such possibilities.

Rather, they confidently flaunted their status as if to say "go ahead and try to catch up if you can."

Just being able to enter magic school meant their talents were practically verified.

Since it was a place where such talented individuals gathered to compete, the difficulty of advancement was beyond imagination, and catching up to a gap once opened was like reaching for stars in the sky.

The Spirit Zone teacher was Ethella, a certified 6th-grade mage. She appeared to be in her mid-twenties? With brown hair tied back and large glasses, she had such a gentle impression that one couldn't think of her as a mage.

"Before we begin class, new students have joined us. First, Shirone, please stand up and introduce yourself."

Countless gazes turned toward Shirone. Amy was among them.

"Oh my! Isn't that the boy we saw yesterday? His name must be Shirone."

Amy's friend Seriel exclaimed excitedly. But Amy didn't respond. It was definitely a face she seemed to have seen somewhere, but she couldn't remember at all.

"Huh! Senior, do you know him?"

A junior from Class Five interjected.

"He's a new student who just entered, and they say he was placed in Class Seven right away. According to the teachers, he has tremendous talent."

"Really? I like him even more. Which family's young master could he be? Do you know his surname?"

"Damn it!"

Amy suddenly shouted. Seriel looked at her with surprised eyes. It was the first time such crude words had come from Amy's mouth.

"Amy, what's wrong?"

"Huh? Oh, nothing. It's nothing."

Tremendous talent. Which family's young master. These two keywords awakened her memory.

It was the boy she had met in the back alley six years ago.

'He did have talent. But he was definitely a commoner. No, even among commoners, the lowest class. But how is he here?'

Shirone introduced himself in a calm voice.

"Hello. I am Arian Shirone. I'll be taking classes together in Class Seven. Please take care of me."

The students welcomed Shirone with applause. The seniors were happy to have a new junior, and the girls were happy to have a handsome boy join them.

However, there were also some unfavorable looks among them. It was justified hostility toward someone who would become a future competitor.

After the new students' introductions ended, Ethella proceeded with the lesson.

"Now, everyone. What is a Spirit Zone?"

"The mind of a mage."

"Correct. The Spirit Zone is the mind manifested in form. The initial form is spherical. Because that's what concentration is like. However, the basic form alone has poor efficiency in actual combat."

Ethella entered the magic device called the 'Image Zone.' The same smooth floor that had been present during the entrance exam was spread out, with countless magic circles forming concentric patterns.

As the smooth floor disappeared and a pitch-black space appeared, Ethella seemed to be floating. In that state, when she deployed a Spirit Zone with a diameter of about 10 meters, its form was surprisingly revealed clearly.

'So this is the Image Zone.'

The Image Zone was a device that couldn't be created without countless magical engineering principles and enormous funding backing it.

However, if the Spirit Zone could be seen with the eyes, the achievement level of classes would be significantly higher. It wasn't for nothing that Alpheas Magic School was one of the kingdom's five prestigious institutions.
