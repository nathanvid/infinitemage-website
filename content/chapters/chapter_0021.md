Ethella moved with comfortable steps, unlike someone who had entered the Spirit Zone, as she continued her explanation.

"Now, this is the basic form of the Spirit Zone. It controls all space equally. However, in actual combat, there are few opportunities to use the entire space except in special situations. Let me show you an example."

When Ethella snapped her fingers, a target appeared 20 meters away.

"With a sphere of 10 meters in diameter, you cannot apply magical effects to that target. You have no choice but to move directly or increase the size of the Spirit Zone. But if you change the form, this method is also possible."

Ethella's zone stretched toward the direction of the target. The volume remained the same, but by changing the form, she had captured the target.

"When you change the form of your mind, the form of the Spirit Zone changes as well. Then like this..."

Ethella extended her hand and said.

"Fire."

The fire shot out with a bang and burned the target 20 meters away. The students attending their first class widened their eyes. Ethella, who had seemed harmless with her gentle appearance, suddenly appeared magnificent.

"But this method has a fatal problem."

At Ethella's continued words, the new students felt embarrassed. The demonstration from moments ago was actually a bad example, which was mortifying.

"The form of the zone can be modified in various ways. However, if you have to calculate the form every time in actual combat where every second counts, that would also be inefficient. Therefore, mages pattern several forms. These are the four patterns of the Spirit Zone, namely the Four-Direction Style of the zone."

Shirone's heart pounded at this concept he was encountering for the first time.

"The first of the Four-Direction Style is the defensive form."

Ethella's Spirit Zone contracted tightly and transformed into an icosahedral polyhedron with twenty triangular faces. Though it was a crude shape, from a distance it approximated a sphere.

"The basic form of defense is the polyhedron. You build a mental framework with frames. The more frames there are, the stronger the durability, and it's a form that can protect the maximum number of allies. Next is the offensive form."

Ethella changed the form of her Spirit Zone. The surface area of the sphere seemed to shrink, then dozens of long spikes extended in all directions.

"The offensive form is called the star shape. Instead of reducing the central area, it extends numerous zones outward. Since it covers all directions, there's no need to consider the target's position, and it's also useful when facing multiple enemies. Next is the target form."

Ethella's zone underwent another transformation. Centering on her, the Spirit Zone extended north, south, east, and west, forming a cross shape.

"The basic form of targeting is the cross. Among the basic forms of the Four-Direction Style, it has the longest range, and while its firepower is lower than the offensive form, it can easily capture targets. The zone rotates around the mage to capture targets."

When she snapped her fingers, targets began moving around Ethella. Matching this, Ethella also pursued the targets with sharp eyes.

"45 degrees to the side. Fire."

Each time the cross spinning like a whirlwind caught the targets, flames shot out. Magic was cast simultaneously in all directions—front, back, left, and right—and there were no errors as if she had eyes in the back of her head.

"What you must master in the target form is the rotation speed of the Spirit Zone. At the extreme, there's the linear form with maximum range, but it's not used unless you're a sniper style. Because the mage is positioned at the end of the linear form, changing direction is extremely difficult."

After showing the three forms, Ethella paused to clean her glasses.

"Finally, the separation form involves moving the center of the zone. In other words, you could say you're moving your brain."

Shirone didn't understand her words. The center of the zone is the mage's head. But how could that be moved?

Ethella returned to the basic form.

After a moment, the Spirit Zone began moving while maintaining its spherical form.

After 10 seconds passed, the Spirit Zone completely separated from Stella's body.

Shirone was shocked. If the zone was the mage's mind, what on earth was at the center of that zone?

"This is the separation form. Among the Four-Direction Style, it's a special form. If the Spirit Zone represents the unity of subject and object, the separation form can be called the unity of self and universe. The farther the separation distance, the smaller the zone becomes, and it's difficult enough to master that there are specialized mages for it. However, among the Four-Direction Style, it can move the fastest and activation is instantaneous."

Ethella finally demonstrated the Four-Direction Style in succession. It became solid as an icosahedral polyhedron, then spiky as a star shape, stretched into a cross form, then returned to a sphere before the zone separated from the body and swirled rapidly around her.

"Wooooow..."

The Class Seven students finally realized. The continuous transformation of the Four-Direction Style wasn't something that could be done with just 1-2 years of practice. The teacher before them wasn't a naive innocent but a certified 6th-grade mage.

"You will be training in this Four-Direction Style from now on. You'll repeatedly perform the four forms. Now, let's practice by class."

The students received differentiated instruction according to difficulty level. Shirone also attended Ethella's class with the Class Seven students.

"First, let's learn about the defensive form. While mages specialize in different fields according to their tendencies, it's good to steadily polish the defensive form. You can demonstrate concentration even in chaotic battlefields, and most importantly, you gain the power to resist Anti-Magic."

Shirone recalled the warning he had heard yesterday. Though the staff member hadn't answered, questions had remained afterward.

"Teacher, I have a question. Ah! Excuse me, may I ask a question?"

"Hehe, ask as many questions as you like. Surely asking if you can ask a question isn't the actual question, right?"

"Yes. Why is Anti-Magic forbidden magic? Many mages are legally researching Anti-Magic, aren't they?"

"Hmm, let's see. There are two types of Anti-Magic. Mages' Anti-Magic and artifacts. Do you know about this?"

"Yes, I know about it."

"Anti-Magic is more like a Spirit Zone with special properties rather than magic itself. Therefore, efficiency varies according to the mage's mind. That's different from artifacts."

"So approaching it carelessly could be dangerous."

"Exactly. If cast in an unskilled state, accidents can happen. Mages who major in Anti-Magic train in it their entire lives. Most have ruthless personalities. The school doesn't want to recommend such methods to you students yet."

Shirone nodded. Since it was magic that destroyed each other's minds, it wasn't a subject to study within the school.

"Now! Let's get back to it and perform the Four-Direction Style."

The Class Seven students each began practical training. Shirone also practiced the defensive form. The trick was to first build a mental framework and then connect it.

After practicing for quite a while, Shirone felt his Spirit Zone becoming solid and his eyes flashed open. Since it wasn't the Image Zone, he couldn't confirm it visually, but he definitely seemed to have accomplished something.

While Shirone's natural tendency being convergent type helped him, even considering that, it was remarkable progress. It was the reward for six years of effort performing only the Spirit Zone.

"Whoa! Look at that!"

Just then, classmates shouted while pointing at the Image Zone. The Class Four students were taking turns training, and Amy was currently demonstrating a spectacular display.

Amy was using the target form. Her cross rotated 90 degrees to the right, then 270 degrees to the left, twisting angles in constantly changing ways while shooting flames.

The zone's length was about 20 meters, which was a decent level for target form, but the rotation speed of the axis was beyond imagination.

Even with targets rising from all directions, the number of flames shooting from four directions was at rapid-fire level.

After instantly destroying 120 targets, Amy withdrew her zone. Beautiful appearance and excellent skills. The underclassmen were looking up at her with sparkling eyes.

"Is that senior Carmis Amy?"

"First-class family and an incredible face, plus skills on top of that. If I could just date a senior like that, school life would be amazing."

"Give it up. Over 100 guys have made passes at that senior. But she doesn't give them a single glance."

"Of course. Carmis is a family recognized even in the Kingdom."

Listening to the conversation among the Class Seven kids, Shirone realized anew. Why had such a girl from a good family been hanging around with thugs six years ago?

While having such thoughts, Shirone flinched his shoulders. Amy, coming down from the Image Zone, was staring straight at Shirone. Naturally, other students also turned their attention to Shirone.

"What? Do those two know each other?"

"No way? That's the kid who enrolled yesterday, right?"

"Don't tell me she's fallen for him? She's someone who hates even making eye contact with guys."

Hearing the murmuring, Amy hastily turned her gaze away. To make such a mistake. But honestly, she was so concerned it was driving her crazy.

To Amy, Shirone was the only person who knew about her past immature behavior. Of course, she hadn't matured now either, but since she started learning magic, she had settled all her past.

'This won't do. I'm about to be a graduating class soon, and if rumors spread here, everything could turn to nothing. What do I do now?'

Amy returned to her seat, but no student wanted to use the Image Zone. She was undisputedly the number one in the advanced class, so whoever stepped up would only be humiliated in front of the underclassmen.

Shirone thought this was an opportunity and went to find Ethella.

"Teacher, if it's okay, could I try going in?"

"Huh? Into the Image Zone?"

Ethella tilted her head. Why would a student who had just started learning the principles of the Four-Direction Style use the Image Zone?

"Wait a moment... the rule is for upperclassmen to use it first."

Ethella waited for a moment. But still, no one wanted to use the Image Zone. Rather than let the expensive device sit idle, she approved with the intention of at least giving him experience.

"Fine. It would be good to try it in advance. However, you can't raise targets. You might get hurt."

"Yes. I thought it would be good to see the image of the defensive form with my eyes."

"Huh?"

Ethella asked back as if wondering what he meant, but Shirone didn't hear and left his spot.

When he climbed onto the Image Zone, the seniors whistled and clapped. Rather than encouragement, it was clearly an attitude of wanting to see some entertainment, but Shirone didn't mind and walked to the center.

Amy, who had been drinking water, turned her gaze at the noisy sound. The moment she spotted Shirone, she spat out the water she was holding.

"Pfft!"

"Amy, are you okay? What's wrong?"

"What is that guy doing? What does a Class Seven think he's going to do up there?"

The sudden incident turned the class into break time. But Shirone was seriously concentrating.

When he entered the Spirit Zone, the sphere rapidly swelled up. The moment he saw it with his eyes, he was breathless. Overwhelmed by the image, Shirone unconsciously stopped expanding.

The students who had been chattering lost their words. The zone's size was 20 meters in diameter. Considering that Class Seven's average diameter was 13 meters, it could be considered the appearance of a large-scale new student.

"Wow! The size is big."

"Hmph. Does magic work just because you inflate the size? It's just like a soap bubble."

Shirone was flustered. The frame that had definitely succeeded before entering the Image Zone was bending like taffy.

'Why isn't it working?'

Had his mind been disturbed by visually confirming the Spirit Zone? Of course, that possibility was sufficient.

But Shirone didn't think he was that weak. There was definitely a problem at the fundamental level.

'Oh! That's it!'

If he performed the Four-Direction Style in his current state, the Spirit Zone would inevitably collapse. Because Shirone, as a beginner, needed much more mental power for Four-Direction Style changes than experts.

It was a situation where he was building a structure but lacked materials. With a diameter of 20 meters, he couldn't construct frames as solid as steel.

'I need to expand it to the maximum.'
