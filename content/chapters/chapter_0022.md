Shirone concentrated his mind even more intensely. Instead of focusing on what he could see through the Image Zone, he dove solely into the Spirit Zone, and the already large sphere expanded to twice its size.

The upperclassmen's mouths fell open in shock. The measurement displayed on the record showed a diameter of 41 meters.

Considering that Class Four's average diameter was 27 meters, this was approaching graduation-level numbers.

"What, what's this? How is that guy's Zone so huge?"

Ethella was equally surprised.

Of course, the Spirit Zone could be expanded through training as much as one wanted.

However, it required mental growth including enlightenment, not just the physical hardships that knights endured.

While the body was honest and would surely show results with consistent training despite the difficulty, the mind was a battle against vague illusions where there were no right answers.

There were countless mages in the world who spent their entire lives failing to achieve their desired results and became frustrated.

This was why magic was considered a realm of talent.

'I've never seen such an outstanding Zone from the start. He must have grown up contemplating the world and exploring his inner self from a young age. But he's only 18 years old—is this really possible?'

Unlike before, Shirone gained confidence. As his Spirit Zone expanded, he finally felt the framework taking shape.

Unaware that numerous students were watching him with surprised expressions, he was busy connecting the framework of his Spirit Zone.

'I mustn't be obsessed. I need to compress everything at once.'

Shirone gritted his teeth and opened his eyes wide. As he entered the defensive form of the Four-Direction Style, the large sphere compressed around Shirone as if trying to crush him.

The force was so intense that the spectators could almost hear the phantom sound of "Crrrack!" as it compressed.

"Uhhhhh..."

A groan escaped from somewhere.

Shirone gazed in wonder at the Four-Direction Style he had deployed. It felt like being trapped inside a solid diamond crystal.

It was a perfectly interlocked form, just like the cube Ethella had demonstrated. The Zone's diameter was 13 meters. Going from 41 meters to 13 meters was 30 percent efficiency, but success was success nonetheless.

"He really did it! A new student achieved the Four-Direction Style on his first day!"

When some thoughtless Class Seven kids made a fuss, several upperclassmen frowned.

However, there were just as many people showing favorable reactions. Most of them were female students, of course.

Amy didn't belong to either group. She was simply starting to find Shirone seriously irritating.

How could she have forgotten? Wasn't her resolve to learn magic born from the humiliation she suffered because of Shirone?

'What exactly is that guy?'

This wasn't a school you could enter with talent alone. He must have met a supporter. Who could be behind him?

"Teacher, the volume decreased much more than I expected."

"Huh? That's inevitable. But the durability will have improved significantly. It should be able to withstand physical impacts to some degree."

Shirone agreed. The firmness of the framework was transmitted as clearly as through his skin. At this level, there would be no risk of separating from the Spirit Zone even when receiving physical impacts.

Ethella scratched her eyebrow.

'I heard he surprised the teachers during the new student test—I guess the rumors were true.'

Of course, you couldn't get full from the first spoonful. While she acknowledged his tremendous insight, his success with the defensive form was due to his convergent nature combined with his abnormally large Zone.

Shirone, belatedly realizing people's reactions, returned to being a shy boy and retreated to a corner.

Perhaps buried under all those gazes, Shirone didn't notice that Amy was staring at him with intense eyes.

## The Cold Boy and the Hot Girl (1)

Shirone was frantically busy encountering various academic subjects. While graduating students could choose their majors, until then he had to complete all subjects, making the scope enormous.

The first period was basic chemistry class. As he entered Class Seven's auditorium, students were taking their seats. And at the podium stood a familiar face.

Olivar Siena, authority on ice magic.

The second daughter of the Olivar family and a graduate of the Olivar school. Age 26. A genius who reached certified 6th-grade mage status through ice magic alone. Beautiful face. Cold personality.

She was someone who had left a strong impression on Shirone during the new student test thanks to her chilly attitude.

But she was surprisingly popular among male students. Her beautiful appearance, position as a teacher, and mature sharp personality—for students, these were all irresistible romantic fantasies.

She had her long purple hair neatly pinned up and adjusted her horn-rimmed glasses as she spoke.

"Hello. I'm Olivar Siena, and I'll be teaching Class Seven's chemistry from today."

Thunderous applause erupted. Some whistled or blatantly asked if she had a boyfriend.

Siena ignored their voices and opened her book first. Then she subtly raised her gaze to look somewhere.

Shirone felt creeped out. He had the feeling she was looking at him.

He thought it might be his imagination, but Shirone's feeling was actually accurate. The reason she, who was in charge of Class Five, had taken time to open one more class was solely because of Shirone.

'Talent rots when it stagnates. It's better to promote him as quickly as possible.'

Once you elevate talent, it somehow follows. She planned to promote Shirone to crush the spirit of her rival Thad while also upholding her convictions as a teacher.

Whatever her ulterior motives, students were simply delighted to receive lessons from the most popular teacher.

"Teacher, is it true that you're dating Teacher Thad? It's not, right?"

"Tell us about your first love. It's our first class."

"Please tell us, teacher. Please!"

As the students' protests continued, Siena furrowed her brow. Then an ice crystal with a 30-centimeter diameter appeared beside her.

Whirrrrr! Whirrrrr!

The ice began rotating and grinding, scattering snowflakes in all directions. The cold particles instantly lowered the classroom temperature.

The children who had initially laughed saying "It's a bit cold" gradually stiffened their expressions. The temperature drop continued endlessly until they were too frozen to even move their mouths.

"Teacher! It's c-cold..."

"Let's begin class."

Siena descended from the podium and approached the students. As the ice's rotation speed decreased, the temperature rose. But it was still below freezing.

"What principle does the ice magic I just activated work on?"

Siena held out her palm with an ice crystal floating above it.

"What is cold air?"

With the question, she clenched her fist and the ice crystal shattered into pieces.

"Being cold means lacking energy. There's no such thing as cold energy. Therefore, while temperature can rise infinitely, it cannot drop infinitely. A state of zero energy—we call that absolute zero."

Shirone frantically took notes of her words.

"If you steal energy from the atmosphere, you can create ice crystals. Common ice, of course. But what happens if you break it down to the particle level and blow it with wind power? As you saw earlier, even simple ice can drop temperatures to levels that could kill humans."

Students' faces turned pale at the mention of death.

"So how do we absorb energy? No, how do mages cast magic?"

Siena held up two fingers and pointed to each one.

"Omniscience, omnipotence. Mages cast magic through omniscience and omnipotence. The Spirit Zone synchronizes the mage's mind with the world. Therefore, within that domain, the mage holds a godlike position. That's why we call it omnipotence. But that alone cannot activate magic. Just saying 'become hot' won't raise the temperature inside the Spirit Zone. Here, knowledge of how to actually raise temperature is needed. That's omniscience."

Shirone's head nodded naturally. The reason he hadn't been able to cast magic until now was because he had only trained in omnipotence while severely lacking in omniscience.

"You will encounter various academic subjects with me and other teachers from now on. The Spirit Zone is only half of magic—without omniscience, you cannot become an excellent mage. Now let's begin the basic chemistry class."

Only then did Siena turn around and begin writing on the blackboard. It was the real class, and the students' concentration was higher than ever.

'Indeed. You don't become a popular teacher just by being pretty.'

Trust in a teacher encourages students' desire to achieve, so Shirone also listened to the class without noticing time pass.

There were difficult words he couldn't understand, but he didn't mind.

The spine of knowledge was already complete, and from today he planned to devour other academic subjects in earnest.

5 PM.

When class ended, students poured out of the auditorium. Shirone also felt his head heavy as he headed toward the dormitory.

Students who had joined research clubs were going in small groups of three to five, carrying lunchboxes. Shirone, who wasn't in a research club, planned to grab a quick bite and go to the library.

"Huh?"

Suddenly his body felt light. Coming to his senses from the floating sensation, he found his feet off the ground being rapidly dragged somewhere.

The force pulling at his collar was so strong it was choking him. It was superhuman strength and speed.

After running for about 3 minutes, they arrived in a forest within the gardens.

As the speed decreased, Shirone floated up and fell on his bottom.

The impact traveled up through his tailbone.

After coughing and catching his breath for a moment, he hurriedly looked up at the person who had brought him.

A suspicious figure with a black mask covering their face looked around nervously, then confirmed no one was around and removed the mask.

"Wha, what?"

Shirone's eyes widened. The identity of the suspicious figure was none other than Carmis Amy. She had been radiant from afar, but up close her delicate features were truly beautiful.

Amy seemed to realize something from Shirone's expression and raised her hand, conjuring flame magic.

"I knew my guess was right. You remember me, don't you?"

"Uh, what?"

"I should have dealt with this earlier or it would have been big trouble. I'll burn your lips and make you mute."

Shirone didn't dodge the approaching flames but simply watched them. Unless she was insane, even violence needed basis and purpose. It lacked credibility to burn someone's face at school.

As expected, her palm stopped in front of Shirone's eyes. The flames had already disappeared. She had intended to frighten Shirone into submission, but she frowned and asked:

"What are you? Are you really that same coward from before?"

There was no trace of the boy who had been caught by back-alley thugs, his face pale with terror, legs trembling.

"You remember me too, don't you, senior?"

Amy grabbed Shirone by the collar and pulled him up.

"Who's your senior, you bastard! What the hell happened? You're a commoner and a complete country bumpkin! So how did you get in here?"

Shirone didn't understand why she was so agitated. If she had been bothered by a commoner entering a noble school, she wouldn't have brought him to such a quiet place from the start.

"There are circumstances, but before that, why did you drag me here?"

"Huh? Why?"

It had actually been an impulsive decision. At first she had planned to ignore him, but she couldn't. Even minor secrets being discovered made her too uncomfortable to focus on anything, and Shirone held a major bomb that could end her school life.

"Tell me honestly! How did you get into school?"

Since this punch seemed like it wouldn't stop, Shirone hurriedly spilled everything.

When he explained that he had entered as a guest through the Ozent family's patronage, Amy released his collar.

"Oh! A guest of the Ozent family?"
