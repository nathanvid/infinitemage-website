Amy's head was spinning. This was definitely a lie. There was no way a commoner could enter a noble family's home as a guest. This conclusion was reached because she didn't know about Rian's knightly oath.

"You didn't tell anyone that you know me, right?"

"I didn't tell anyone. What good memory would that be?"

If that was the case, then Shirone was a bomb that could explode at any moment. The thought of going through school life carrying such a bomb was truly terrifying.

Amy came up with a clever scheme. She deliberately raised her head arrogantly and said:

"You're Class Seven, right? I'm Class Four."

"I know, senior."

"Then from today on, you're going to be my subordinate."

"What? Subordinate?"

"I'm holding your weakness, aren't I? If I just open my mouth, you'll get kicked out of school, right? So from now on, become my subordinate. You have to listen to whatever I say."

Shirone looked bewildered.

"Why should I do that? You're my senior anyway, so I'd follow your orders if you gave them."

"How naive. Do you think I'd give you such easy tasks? From now on, I'll make you cry tears of frustration, so look forward to it."

If she couldn't chase after Shirone, she'd make Shirone chase after her. By keeping him in her sight and provoking his pride, she could confirm his hidden intentions.

"What kind of work will you have me do?"

"After classes end, buy bread and coffee and come running to me. Got it? If you spill even one drop of coffee, I'll make you go back and get it again."

Though Shirone had a good personality, this time he was truly angry. Bread delivery? Did she think he had entered school to deliver bread?

"Ho ho ho! Then starting tomorrow, wait for me in front of the Great Library. If you just listen well, I'll end this quickly, so don't worry."

Amy poked Shirone's forehead repeatedly while laughing.

Shirone was flustered. Was this really Amy, who was called the goddess of Alpheas?

"Oh, right. And..."

Amy, who had been turning to leave, looked back at Shirone. As her hand shot up, the surrounding air began to rotate. At the same time, Shirone's body floated into the sky.

"Huh!"

It was tornado magic that manipulated atmospheric pressure to create wind. Though it was magic that had previously left Shirone helpless, to Amy, who was currently Class Four, it was child's play.

Shirone flailed helplessly as he floated in mid-air. Perhaps because he faced danger, the ground appeared much clearer to him. Even the fallen leaves rolling on the ground were vivid.

So was Amy's grinning face.

'I'll die if I fall.'

The moment he had that thought, Amy leaped up and grabbed the back of Shirone's collar. As his collar pressed against his throat, his breath was suddenly cut off. When he came to his senses, he was already lying on the ground.

"Cough! Cough!"

Having demonstrated both magic and Schema power, she dusted off her hands with satisfaction. Though she had stopped Schema training after age twelve, it was still movement that transcended human limitations.

"This pays back the debt. See you tomorrow then. Ho ho ho!"

As Amy laughed triumphantly and walked away, Shirone was filled with rage. This was the first time in his life he'd encountered such a detestable girl.

But class rank was everything, and skill was all that mattered. Swallowing his frustration, Shirone hung his head low and left the forest. Just thinking about meeting her starting tomorrow already made his future look dark.

* * *

The bell for the last period, 5 o'clock, rang.

Basic physics class had ended. Shirone, who was packing his bag and leaving the lecture hall, let out a deep sigh. He had already been running bread errands for Amy for ten days.

He bought bread and coffee from the school store. Compared to the sponsorship money supported by the Ozent family, the price wasn't even worth mentioning, but it wasn't about the money—it was about his feelings. And that was exactly what Amy was targeting.

"Why is she doing this to me? She was the one who did wrong first."

Walking without spilling the coffee required considerable concentration. Right, let's think of this as a type of training too. Adjusting his walking pace so the coffee wouldn't shake.

"As if that makes sense! Really, how long do I have to keep doing this!"

Shirone felt pathetic.

"Oh my! There goes the romantic boy."

"He must be going to confess to her again today. Really, at that level, it's a disease."

Female students passing by pointed at Shirone and whispered. This was the biggest problem.

When Shirone brought bread and coffee to Amy, she would gracefully accept them and disappear into the library.

Already among the students, rumors were rampant that Shirone had a crush on Amy. The more such rumors flourished, the more coldly Amy treated Shirone.

Watching Amy so persistently resolve her grudge from six years ago, Shirone's fantasies about women were completely shattered.

"Hey! Here comes your prince."

"What prince? More like a servant."

Amy waited for Shirone at the main entrance of the Great Library with Seriel. The area was bustling with students who had made time to watch this extraordinary spectacle.

As Shirone climbed the stairs, the watching female students giggled and clapped. Shirone's face turned as red as a beet.

Seriel said with a pitying smile:

"But he's kind of pitiful. Since he's going this far, how about you accept him?"

Amy's eyes widened.

"What? What are you talking about? Why would I accept him?"

"Stop pretending. Honestly, a girl who won't even make eye contact with boys faithfully takes the coffee and bread Shirone brings her. Some kids are wondering if the goddess of Alpheas is finally getting a partner."

This was absurd. This was entirely a strategy to provoke Shirone, but things seemed to be flowing in an unusual direction.

Actually, she had been thinking about a week or so. But somehow, Shirone never showed any sign of displeasure and dutifully brought bread without fail.

'Ugh! At this rate, we'll really get tangled up in strange rumors. I need to stop this now.'

When Shirone handed Amy the bread and coffee, cheers erupted from the crowd. The devotion of not spilling a single drop of coffee for his beloved woman was touching. Of course, it was a complete misunderstanding, and the rift between the parties involved only deepened.

"Senior, here's your coffee."

"Ugh! So annoying!"

Amy raised her hand. To correct the absurd misunderstanding, embarrassing him was the best method.

She planned to hit his arm and spill the coffee. Then Shirone would become just like all the other male students who had been rejected, and the strange rumors would die down too.

"Who asked you to bring this junk?"

As Amy swung her hand, the students' eyes widened. But the expected disaster didn't happen.

Amy stared at the coffee, her hand trembling.

'If only he'd show some sign of dislike. You fool? You idiot? Do men have no backbone?'

It was an unexpected pang of conscience. But that was Shirone's strength.

If he had to do something anyway, it was better to think positively about it. That attitude made Amy feel guilty.

"Um, senior, here's your coffee."

Having studied harder than anyone to secure her place in Class Four, Amy knew. The time he was wasting like this was far too precious for Shirone.

When her thoughts reached that point, she felt quite sorry. It wasn't like she avoided men because she feared others' attention—she was simply annoyed by them. She couldn't stand those who acted all high and mighty as nobles despite having no real ability.

'Let them think what they want. As long as it's not me, that's fine.'

Amy accepted the bread and coffee. Then applause erupted from all sides as if watching a performance.

"From now on, I don't need it, so don't bring this junk anymore! Got it?"

"What? Oh, yes."

Was this how her anger was finally resolved? Thinking he would never have to see her again, Shirone sighed with relief.

But as a result, Amy's statement only caused greater misunderstanding among the students.

"She accepted him! Amy accepted Shirone's feelings!"

"She even said she doesn't need coffee anymore. Does that mean he can just come without bringing anything?"

Amy entered the library as if she didn't want to respond. Seriel hurriedly followed, unable to hide her excitement.

"Hey! What are you planning to do? If it's real, that's great, but did you really mean what you said?"

"I don't know! Let them think what they want. Don't they have anything better to do? Anyway, when I get to the graduating class, that's it. Let them play their childish games!"

Coming down the library stairs, Shirone felt as if he could fly. Ten days of hardship. Honestly, he hadn't expected it to end this quickly. From tomorrow, he could go straight to the library without wasting time.

"Yahoo! I can read one more book!"

Shirone, who had captured Amy's heart. Male students who had fallen into such a misunderstanding watched enviously as Shirone ran away.

11 PM.

Amy closed her book and sighed. Though she had never thought studying was fun, she did love the library. This place was much better than being around people who gossiped about others' love lives, people for whom others were more important than themselves.

Despite the approaching midnight hour, the library was still overflowing with students. These people had no interest in who was dating whom. They were racehorses running frantically to achieve their dreams.

Watching them made her realize that even time spent lost in idle thoughts was precious.

But she was still first in Class Four and didn't think for a moment that she would be overtaken.

Seriel, sitting next to her, turned her head.

"Huh? Why are you closing your book? Going in already?"

"Yeah. I'm feeling a bit unsettled today. I'll just rest well and wake up about an hour early tomorrow."

"Really? Then let's go together."

"No. You don't need to rest because of me. See you tomorrow."

"Okay then. Go well. Make sure to wake up early tomorrow."

Amy smiled as she packed her bag. In six years of attending school, Fortress Seriel was the only one she maintained as a friend. Though she was a chatterbox like any other peer, she was reliable when it mattered. Her grades were also sixth in Class Four, a ranking that would safely get her into the graduating class.

Amy liked Seriel, who knew how to enjoy mature competition rather than shallow friendship.

After encouraging her friend, Amy left the reading room.

Except for those on duty, all staff had gone home, so the corridors were silent. While students had dreams in school, for employees it was just a workplace to earn money.

Amy went down the stairs, stretching to relieve the day's fatigue. Then she discovered someone standing in the darkness of the landing.

Pale skin with dark circles under the eyes. Black hair covered his cheeks. Amy's face immediately crumpled when she confirmed the man's face illuminated by moonlight.

It was Ardius Jake.

He was of the second-rank nobility, and his family head was the royal treasury executive officer. Perhaps due to the special nature of managing royal finances, the family's power was said to be no less than that of first-rank nobles.

Jake's personality was arrogant and irritable. But the real reason Amy disliked him was that he was a student with little talent who didn't even make an effort.

Though they took classes together in Class Four, Jake was far from the level needed to enter the graduating class. Moreover, there were rumors that he was the president of a research group called Black Magician.

In Amy's opinion, what Black Magician researched was how to torment students better than themselves.

Since it wasn't a school-approved research group, it didn't even receive funding. In short, it was a dark circle where students suffering from inferiority complex tormented excellent students.

Of course, they didn't openly pick fights or extort money. Since most students were children of high-ranking nobles, acting like back-alley thugs would result in immediate expulsion.

Nevertheless, hearing rumors that several students had been victimized by Black Magician suggested they were definitely active in some way.

"Amy, you finished early today. I was planning to wait until midnight."

"Why are you waiting for me? Don't you have anything to do?"

"Don't be so harsh. I heard your rumor. You opened your heart to some lowly junior named Shirone?"

Amy pressed her forehead and sighed. Was he in his right mind? Coming all the way to the library to talk about such pathetic things.

Jake smiled sleazily and offered her coffee. Amy could tell just from the aroma. It was civet coffee, popular among nobles.

"I heated it up warm. Someone like the great Amy should receive at least this much. You can't dirty your mouth with cheap coffee."

Amy looked at the coffee, then raised her head with bewilderment.

"What are you doing right now?"

"As you can see, I'm courting you. You know our family's power well, and following in my father's footsteps, I'll be in charge of royal finances too. Aren't I the right man for you?"

"Sorry, but I don't have private conversations in the library. So you got the place wrong, the timing wrong. Oh, I almost forgot the most important thing—you got the person wrong too. I don't like you. So let's both be careful to avoid this kind of thing in the future."

Amy stepped aside and went down the stairs. Then Jake pressed against the wall, blocking her path.

"What do you think you're doing?"

"Maybe I was too gentle. I also have family dignity to consider, so this kind of situation is troublesome. You're the same, aren't you? You study desperately to avoid bringing shame to the Carmis family? We have the same worries."

Amy snorted. No matter how great the Ardius family was, Carmis wasn't a family to be casually gossiped about by them. Above all, she didn't like Jake's way of speaking.

"A money-counting miser."

"What?"

"Our family's principle is to live doing what we want. You think it's something great to brag about wanting to count money like your father? We're qualitatively different from you."

Jake's eyes became bloodshot. Even if she was first-rank nobility, she couldn't treat him carelessly.

My father is the royal treasury executive officer. Everything in the world ends with money. Amy was the one being recklessly immature.

"Is the Carmis family so great? You're first-rank in name only, but how many people actually hold power in active positions? With our family's power, we could financially destroy something like Carmis. How about it? If you can't believe it, shall we try it once?"

Amy felt chills from Jake's murky aura. He was a man who could endlessly torment others for his own advancement. She finally realized why she had been unsettled all day.

"Phew. Thanks to you, I understand now. Why I accepted the coffee."

"What?"

"You're different from Shirone. In short, you're a coward."

"Haha! I'm more of a coward than that pathetic bastard? Shall I prove it to you right now?"

"You seem dying to do something, so if you're going to do it, do it quickly. Don't waste time babbling. Do you think I'll be scared just because you can't do this or that but put force in your eyes?"

Amy struck Jake's mug. The expensive coffee splattered against the wall. The mug cracked and shattered on the stairs.
