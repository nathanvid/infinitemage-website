Jake felt like his blood was flowing backwards. His hours of waiting to meet Amy had been met with humiliation.

"A girl like you...! Gah!"

Jake shut his mouth and cowered. Amy had already entered her Spirit Zone. Probably the target form of the Four-Direction Style.

"A girl like me? You're all talk, but do I really look that ridiculous to you? If you're so pissed off, then come at me. I'll burn you to ashes right now."

Jake ground his teeth. His assumption that she was just a model student who buried herself in books had been a mistake. She too was a delinquent who had roamed the back alleys from a young age.

"Using magic at this time is against regulations."

"You used magic first, didn't you? While you were warming up that musk cat or whatever it was."

"Crazy! You think that's the same as the Four-Direction Style...!"

"Haha!"

Amy couldn't help but burst into laughter. He was nothing more than a petty man after all. A petty man who got scared stiff the moment she revealed her true power. Most of the men she'd met were like that.

"You know why I accepted Shirone's coffee? That kid seems to take responsibility for everything himself. Unlike you, whining about family status and regulations, he does what he can do. If you don't disappear right now, I'll burn you up. There won't even be a trace left."

Jake was certain. She wasn't lying. The crimson eyes of the Carmis family that he'd only heard about in rumors. Her large pupils were glowing red hot.

"If you kill me..."

"I don't care. I also take responsibility for what I do."

Jake bit down on his molars hard enough to break them. He'd never felt such intense humiliation before.

But faced with the overwhelming pressure radiating from those crimson eyes, even a scoundrel like Jake had no choice but to back away.

He was caught in Amy's Four-Direction Style. If she was the top student of Class Four, she could burn him with almost absolute certainty.

"Just you wait, you arrogant bitch!"

Jake ground his teeth as he stomped out of the Great Library. Only after he disappeared from sight did the crimson light fade from her eyes. Amy staggered briefly, then rubbed her eyes and muttered.

"Annoying. What terrible luck."

She'd tried to rest for once in a while, only to waste time on a scummy human. That fact was unbearably irritating. Time that passes can never be returned.

Why were all the men who clung to her always types like that? She wondered if there was something wrong with her personality.

A soft laugh escaped Amy's lips.

"Well, there are plenty of problems."

Suddenly Amy felt sorry for Shirone.

* * *

Having escaped from his life of slavery to Amy, Shirone was happy every day. There's a saying: "You don't know what you have until it's gone." Realizing how precious that one hour stolen by Amy had been made studying even more enjoyable.

Thanks to causing a scandal with the most arrogant girl in school, he had to endure people's stares, but no one cared about that in the Great Library. This kind of academic fervor was the driving force that made Alpheas Magic School prestigious.

Today too, having finished his classes, Shirone was humming as he headed to the Great Library. Then near the faculty quarters, he spotted a familiar face.

It was Fortress Seriel, Amy's friend. Seeing her pacing restlessly as if urgently needing the bathroom, Shirone changed direction.

They only exchanged greetings during integrated classes, but he personally found her likeable. Unlike Amy, who would growl whenever she saw him, Seriel always offered words of encouragement. Of course, he still had no idea what she was encouraging him about.

Seriel's eyes widened when she spotted Shirone walking over. Then, as if she'd seen a ghost, she wore a blank expression before frantically running toward him.

"Senior, hello..."

"Hey! What are you doing right now?"

Seriel suddenly grabbed Shirone by the collar and shook him.

"Why are you here?! If I'd known this, I wouldn't have needed to send Amy!"

Shirone tilted his head. The fact that he went straight to the Great Library after classes was something she knew too.

"What's going on? You have to tell me so I can understand."

"Read this! You really had nothing happen to you?"

Seriel held out a crumpled piece of paper. Shirone silently took it and unfolded it. It was a brief warning note sent by someone calling himself Black Magician.

30 minutes earlier.

A man blocked the path of Amy and Seriel as they headed to the Great Library.

He was a Class Five student, a long-term repeater over 23 years old. Since they'd been in the same class just a year ago, they knew his name, but he had such a gloomy personality that they'd never had a conversation.

"Good day, senior. You're still doing well as always."

At the man's sly formal speech, Amy snorted and kept walking.

"I'm busy, so move. I have nothing to say to you."

"Oh, you can't be like that. We were classmates once, so please spare me a moment."

"Was I your only classmate? There must be hundreds of students who went through Class Five, so go find someone else."

Though she was being formal considering his age, she couldn't hide the thorns in her heart. She disliked this man. For someone in Class Five, it wasn't like he had no talent at all, but his mind was elsewhere. What conversation could she have with a worthless human who was content with his mediocre position while hitting on female underclassmen?

"Haha! You're as ill-mannered as ever, Amy."

Poison filled Amy's eyes.

"What? What did you just say?"

She'd shown him consideration for his age, but now he was trying to climb all the way over her head. But the man seemed to have something to rely on, casually handing her a note.

"The boss wants to see you. You'd better do as you're told. Unless you want to make trouble for the prince."

"Prince? What are you talking about?"

Amy frowned as she snatched the note and read it.

*We have Shirone. Come to Training Ground 14 by 6 o'clock before we make him unable to function as a man. If you inform a teacher, something will happen that you'll regret for life, so handle it wisely.*

*Black Magician.*

She immediately crumpled up the note.

"So what? Shirone has nothing to do with me. Even if he did, you think I'd follow your orders?"

"Hehe, that's for you to figure out. I'm just a messenger."

Having successfully completed his mission, the man revealed a vile smile as he leisurely walked away.

Amy, with rage rising to the top of her head, threw the note to the ground. Seriel, who picked it up and read the contents, was also trembling with her hands.

Black Magician. Though their identity hadn't been revealed, it was a delinquent circle that was notorious among students.

"Amy, what do we do? These guys are really vicious. There are rumors that Taira quit school last month because of them too."

"Taira did?"

Taira, a classmate from Class Four, wasn't graduation-level but maintained above-average grades as a skilled student. If they'd threatened her, they must have ganged up on her or used cowardly methods.

"We have to go see. Either way, Shirone was captured because of me."

"Let's tell a teacher instead. I'm worried about Shirone, but you might be in danger too."

"A teacher? Hmm..."

Amy pondered. Setting aside her own past, Shirone had secrets about his origins that would be troublesome if revealed to others.

If the incident grew bigger, rumors would spread throughout the school and Shirone's school life might be finished. Having known the privileged mindset of nobles better than anyone, she was certain of it.

"I'll go check first. If I don't come back by 7, then report to a teacher."

"What do you mean? We should report right now!"

"I'm sorry. There are circumstances for that. I'll tell you everything when I come back, okay?"

When Amy, who was always confident, made such a request, Seriel was flustered. It was the first time this had happened since they'd been friends.

"Then I'll go with you. We don't know how many there will be."

"You need to stay and prepare for emergencies. Don't worry. The leader is probably Jake. With that guy's skills, he can't do anything to me."

Seriel knew Amy's genius better than anyone. She was only blocked by the barrier of the graduating class, but strictly speaking, even within Class Four, the difference in levels varied tremendously. Amy was a skilled practitioner who had never lost her lead position among them.

"Alright. Exactly one hour. If you don't come back by 7, I'll definitely tell a teacher."

"Yes. Then I'll trust you and go come back."

Having heard the whole story from Seriel, Shirone was dumbfounded. It was surprising that a delinquent circle called Black Magician existed, but that Amy had risked danger for his sake.

"So she went because of me? But what are we doing just sitting here?"

"I don't know either! Amy told me to wait no matter what. Why on earth are you here?!"

Shirone thought he understood. The one-hour grace period showed confidence that she could handle it herself. Also, the cause of that action contained consideration to protect his secret. Leaving her friend Seriel as a messenger was an excellent judgment.

"I have to go! Senior, please do as Amy said."

Shirone ran toward Training Ground 14. Though there were still 30 minutes until the appointment time, distance was the problem. Training Ground 14 was located deep in the mountains as a place for actual combat.

Suddenly the scenery swayed and buildings began rushing backward in an instant. When he turned his head, Seriel was already holding onto his side.

"How long were you going to take running? I might as well come with you."

It was short-range teleportation, an essential magic for mages. Though it was prohibited on campus due to possible collision accidents, this wasn't the time to worry about such things.

Students looked up at the explosive popping sounds. Seriel, embracing Shirone, was blinking away toward the mountain at 10-meter intervals.

The two people who arrived at the foot of the mountain jogged up from there. Teleportation was as dangerous as it was efficient, and attempting it in the mountains could cost them their lives.

The two arrived at Training Ground 14 before 6 o'clock. But Amy was nowhere to be seen. There was no sign of Black Magician, let alone any human presence.

"Amy! Amy! What happened? Why isn't she here?"

"Maybe they took her somewhere else? Since the location was exposed in the note, they wouldn't have ruled out the possibility of reporting to a teacher. Maybe we were deceived."

"Then what about Amy?"

Realizing Black Magician's thoroughness, Shirone was certain. They were really planning to cause trouble.

"Go down the mountain now and tell a teacher. You can go much faster without me."

"But Amy said to wait until 7 no matter what. She said there were circumstances. What if Amy is disappointed later?"

"Those circumstances are because of me, so hurry up and go! Since I said it's okay, it doesn't matter!"

Seriel wore a blank expression. So Amy's desperate expression had been because of Shirone.

"Really? What exactly is going on between you two? Are you really secretly dating behind my back?"

"Is this the time for such talk? It could be dangerous if we're late!"

"Ah, fine! You don't wander around anywhere either, just stay here!"

Seriel turned around and retraced the path they'd come. Anyway, if it wouldn't harm Amy, there was no reason not to report it.

Shirone went into the mountains searching for Amy. Unlike other nobles, having spent half his life in the mountains, the dense forest was actually familiar to him.

He expanded his Spirit Zone to maximum range, searching for Amy's traces. After climbing the mountain for about 10 minutes, the first footprint finally reached him through synesthesia.

"Here it is!"

But there were no further traces. Judging by the flattened bushes from this point, she'd definitely flown up into the sky.

Then there was no way to find Amy. Shirone circled the area for quite a while with a troubled feeling. At some point, an explosive sound burst from the sky in the distance. Shirone's head quickly turned toward the source of the sound.
