Black smoke rose from Amy's face. But looking closely, it was rising from her skin with a finger's width of space between them. It was a magic called Air Shield that compressed air to create a localized barrier.

"An ambush right after changing the meeting place. You're as despicable as always."

Amy stood up from her landing position and turned around. The man who had handed her the note was standing there with a sinister smile.

"Hehe, I've got quite a lot built up against you. If you had just gone along with it, you would have had the honor of Amy's first kiss."

"Stop talking as filthy as you look and tell me where Shirone is."

Five silhouettes fell from the sky around Amy. Among them was Jake, the leader of the Black Magicians. Looking around, he spoke with surprise.

"You really came alone. Was that kid really such an important person to you?"

"What nonsense? Trash like you guys are more than enough for me alone. Where is Shirone?"

"Hahaha! That scrawny guy is naturally at the Great Library. Not knowing what his woman is about to go through."

Amy finally realized she had been deceived. But it was actually better this way. Without a hostage, these kinds of scum couldn't touch a single hair on her head.

"Calling me out means you're prepared to die, right?"

"Such great confidence. But will it be that easy? If you saw the list of those who underestimated the Black Magicians and went to their graves, you wouldn't be able to say that."

"Even lacking learning ability has its limits. You talk too much."

Amy entered her Spirit Zone. When she transformed it into the target form of the Four-Direction Style, Jake, recalling yesterday's situation, immediately deployed his Four-Direction Style as well.

But again, the cost of missing the first strike was heavy. Amy ignored Jake and aimed at the members behind him first.

When she cast her specialty Fire Strike consecutively, the men frantically threw themselves aside. Strike-series magic added physical force to magic, making it impossible to block even with Air Shield.

Amy rapidly rotated her Spirit Zone to target them. But human movement had too many variables to achieve 100 percent accuracy like in practice. Every time the Spirit Zone rotated and counter-rotated, her head throbbed.

Jake raised wind and soared into the sky. If Amy's main technique was fire, Jake's was wind. In personal combat anyway, one killing move decided the match. When he cast his most confident Wind Cutter, sharp wind sliced through the air and rushed forward.

Amy didn't sense the Wind Cutter's approach. The cross form of the target form could dramatically increase range, but compared to the sphere that could detect all directions, it was inevitably vulnerable in defense. Especially attacks from the air were a fatal blind spot.

Amy sensed the Wind Cutter penetrating her Spirit Zone and immediately twisted her body. But there was already less than a meter of distance left.

Just as the Black Magicians were about to cheer, her movement twisted so fast it was invisible to the eye. The Wind Cutter grazed past, cutting through her red hair. Jake was shocked.

"What? How did she do that?"

"It's called Schema, you bastard."

Amy raised the target form's cross to an anti-aircraft angle. Then Jake also raised wind and hastily moved away. But her targeting speed was the best in the advanced class.

"Fire Strike."

A fireball the size of a cannonball shot out. Jake, thinking he couldn't dodge, wrapped himself in Air Suit, a higher-level air magic.

Jake, hit by the Fire Strike, crashed to the ground hearing a tremendous cannon blast.

"Argh! Annoying bitch!"

Then he got up and glared at Amy. Flames blazed as they sucked oxygen from the Air Suit. Jake, standing like a demon from hell, exploded the Air Suit, causing flames to fall off like petals. But since Strike's physical force had already entered, his insides twisted.

"I'll kill you."

"Hohoho! You thought you could beat me with that level of skill? You're at just the right level to fail, let alone graduate. This is what happens when you waste your mind on useless things."

Carmis Amy, the genius. Indeed, the difference in skill was as overwhelming as her reputation.

But Jake smiled wickedly.

"Really? Your overconfidence ends here."

As if to prove it wasn't bluff, the Black Magician members simultaneously extended their hands. Then Amy's face turned pale. A strange sensation she had never experienced before crept up. Something was entering her mind and disrupting her thoughts.

Amy glared at Jake with anger.

"This is... Anti-Magic?"

"Hahaha! Surprised? This is the Black Magicians' specialty. It's also the magic that has sent countless talents home."

"Despicable bastard."

It really was a despicable act. Anti-Magic, a magic forbidden by school rules. But once you crossed that forbidden line, for students it was like having their Achilles' heel bitten.

The resonance waves from five people wildly tangled Amy's Spirit Zone. It felt like someone was grabbing her head and shaking it madly.

Amy couldn't endure and fell to her knees. If she maintained the Zone any longer, she might go insane.

Jake, wearing a victor's smile, cast Air Chain. Chains made of air wrapped around Amy's limbs and lifted her up.

Bound in mid-air, Amy struggled with all her might. But it was a restraining force she couldn't escape even using Schema.

"Hehe, finally caught you. The prickly female cat."

Jake drew out a hand knife.

"Now, what shall I do to you? For reference, I still haven't forgotten what happened a few days ago. I'm in the mood to try something."

"I'm warning you, if you leave even one scratch on me, you won't get away unscathed either."

"Puhahaha! Even the great Amy resorts to family threats when cornered? That's what I told you. We're the same. You're just a bitch who can't do anything once you leave your family anyway."

"I told you, didn't I? Don't treat me the same as trash like you. I'll definitely finish you off with my own hands."

Killing intent filled Jake's eyes. Her attitude of not bending her pride even in this situation irritated him. The hand holding the knife trembled as if ready to stab at any moment.

"You're not in a position to talk big. Should I draw on your face? If you become ugly, there won't be annoying guys following you around."

Amy also became a little afraid of Jake's abnormal eyes. An inferiority complex with no bottom in sight. He really intended to go through with it.

Jake grasped the blade with his opposite fingers. Though he wasn't skilled in flame magic, heating metal was easy enough. A bright red glow rose from the inside of the blade.

"Let's do it like this. Arrogant Amy lost her eyes while researching magic alone. She dropped out of magic school and lived as a failure for life. How's that, a wonderful scenario, right?"

Jake showed the blade that looked like molten metal might drip from it at any moment. When he suddenly thrust it forward, Amy turned her head. Her hair caught fire with a crackling sound.

"Ooh! Even Amy has times when she's terrified. I'll give you one last chance. Try begging me to spare you just once. It would be even better if you shed tears. Then promise to leave school, and I'll at least spare your eyes."

Amy realized why Taira had dropped out. They had subdued her with rule-breaking magic that exploited loopholes in school regulations and given her irreparable humiliation.

Just because they were inferior, just because they felt bad, they committed such acts. The red eyes of the enraged Carmis glowed with red light.

"Try it if you can. But never think you guys will be safe."

Jake smirked. It wasn't the first or second time he'd heard such words. Even the students from renowned noble families he'd driven away so far had stubbornness like steel wire. But the moment he brought the blade close, without exception, they had no choice but to scream for their lives.

The stronger someone's pride, the more impossible recovery becomes once it's broken. Watching students leave school that way, Jake soothed the inferiority complex in his heart.

"Well then, shall we slowly get started?"

The hand knife slowly approached Amy's left eye. Amy intended to endure. But as the hot heat was transmitted, her eyelids inevitably closed tight.

"Wait, you bad bastards!"

At the suddenly heard shout, the Black Magician members' shoulders jumped. Amy's eyes widened as she spotted Shirone approaching with clenched fists, seething with anger. Jake also turned with a surprised expression.

"Ooh! The appearance of a prince on a white horse? Too bad, if you'd come just a little later, your woman could have become prettier."

"What are you trying to do to my senior?"

"Well? What was I trying to do? How about asking your girlfriend directly?"

"You idiot! What are you doing coming here alone!"

Amy shouted. But Shirone was more shocked by the situation before his eyes than her words.

A girl with bound limbs was surrounded by older students who were harming her. That bastard Jake was even worse, waving a hand knife while giggling.

'Because of me...'

Feeling extreme anger for the first time in his life, Shirone picked up a log from the ground and shouted.

"Release my senior! If you don't, I won't let you get away with this."

"Puhahaha! Did you hear that? What are you going to do with that piece of wood?"

Ignoring the mocking laughter, Shirone charged at them. Anyway, he had skills that had even beaten Rian in sword fighting. His plan was to use synesthesia as much as possible to buy time until teachers arrived.

"Here I come!"

"Hey guys, he's coming. Open the door for him."

Even as Shirone ran toward them, no one moved. Rather, they wore sneering smiles, seemingly hoping he'd come quickly.

The moment he thought something was strange, Shirone's mind shook as if he'd been hit by a hammer.

"Urgh!"

"Fool! Get rid of your Spirit Zone! It's Anti-Magic!"

Anti-Magic? From Amy's words, Shirone realized. The reason she, who monopolized first place in Class Four, was helplessly caught by these ruffians.

It was truly tremendous shock and vibration. The resonance waves caused by five people simultaneously shook his mind.

Shirone raised his head. The world was like colors bleeding in water, mixing here and there. But he couldn't give up here. Grasping his fading consciousness, he slowly moved his steps.

"Senior, I'll save you now."

"Don't come! You'll never be able to use magic again! You'll become an idiot!"

"Because it's my fault... that this happened..."

"Get out of your Spirit Zone! Quickly!"

Though she knew Shirone couldn't hear her, all she could do was shout. With each step he took to save her, she felt her heart breaking.

Shirone gritted his teeth and maintained his Spirit Zone.

'No! I have to endure. I need more frames.'

Following his strong will, the Spirit Zone gradually began changing into the defensive form of the Four-Direction Style. Then this time the Black Magicians panicked. Casting Anti-Magic became burdensome. It felt like being crushed under a heavy rock.

"Wh-what? Why is this happening?"

Shirone expanded his Spirit Zone to maximum. Though swaying precariously like dew on a blade of grass, he put all his heart into maintaining the form.

'Harder. So it won't collapse. So it won't be destroyed.'

Finally, as the frames connected, the Spirit Zone regained stability. Then in a seesaw game, the Black Magician members began complaining of pain one by one.

"Ugh! What's happening? My head hurts!"

At that moment, Shirone's eyes snapped open. As the defensive form of the Four-Direction Style was perfectly completed, the huge sphere compressed into an icosahedral polyhedron. The pain of Anti-Magic disappeared and a solid feeling rushed in. It was pressure that felt like it could shatter even diamond.

"Aaaaah!"

The five who had activated Anti-Magic screamed and collapsed. As if crushed by something, they couldn't even twitch a finger and were all bleeding from their noses.

This was why the school prohibited Anti-Magic. Unless one refined their mind to near-inanimate levels, Anti-Magic became poison that destroyed oneself instead.

Amy was shocked watching the struggling Black Magicians. He had crushed five people's Anti-Magic alone. And this was a Class Seven student who hadn't even been enrolled for a month.

Shirone felt like there were small lizards crushed under his feet. He could feel them writhing, but that was all the resistance amounted to. As time passed, even that resistance disappeared. They had released Anti-Magic just before their minds collapsed.

Amy burned the Air Chain with flame magic and landed on the ground. Through her Spirit Zone, she could feel what form Shirone's Spirit Zone was in. It was so cold, hard, and heavy.

'My God. How can this be...'

Shirone still had fierce eyes. When he took a step forward, Jake unconsciously stepped back. It was the result of instinct not wanting to collide with Shirone's Spirit Zone.

But a Spirit Zone with a 15-meter diameter couldn't be avoided by just stepping back. Finally, when the two Spirit Zones overlapped, Jake asked with a shocked expression.

"You... what exactly are you?"

It was unbelievable. But the synesthesia of Spirit Zones doesn't lie. The defensive form of the Four-Direction Style. A massive icosahedral polyhedron made of 88 faces surrounded Shirone.
