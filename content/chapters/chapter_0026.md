Black Magician.

A research group formed by six problem students centered around Jake.

Excluding Jake, it was a gathering of students who repeatedly failed their advancement exams—students with no dreams or future.

They too had once been recognized as brilliant talents in their time. If they had just had the courage to try again, they might have eventually achieved victory.

But they had given up on competition themselves. In a way, they were the only dropouts in the ruthless competition.

"This can't be right. Something's wrong."

Jake shook his head. Maybe against Amy, but there was no way Black Magician could lose to a newly enrolled freshman.

"That's right. We didn't lose. We just had bad luck."

The students Jake had forced to drop out until now had incomparably higher grades than Shirone. In the end, it was just bad luck. Don't such days happen often when living in this world?

'It's not over yet. I'm Class Four. I'm fundamentally different from those guys who can only strike from behind with Anti-Magic.'

Shirone read Jake's killing intent and tensed up. Jake's Spirit Zone, which had changed to a star shape, could be felt through synesthesia. It felt as if hundreds of archers were aiming their bows.

'What should I do? I haven't learned magic yet.'

Anti-Magic was manageable since it was a contest of Spirit Zone power, but entering magical combat would be a different story.

There was no way Shirone, who hadn't mastered even Air Shield—the basic defensive magic—let alone offensive magic, could face Jake.

Jake created wind between his palms and compressed it by pressing down. Then the air began rotating in the form of a disk. It was Wind Cutter, capable of easily slicing through logs.

"I'll take your arm first. Then your leg."

Just as Jake was about to cast Wind Cutter, someone grabbed his shoulder from behind and spun him around. At the same time he sensed the approach through synesthesia, the person had already made contact. It wasn't human speed.

He saw Amy's face with her red eyes glaring upward. As her fist struck his jaw, the scenery before his eyes shook.

"Ugh!"

When an attack containing Schema's power hit a magician weak to physical attacks, there was no way his Spirit Zone could withstand it.

Amy climbed onto Jake's stomach and threw punches repeatedly. Each blow felt like being struck with a stone.

"What were you going to do to me? Say it again, you bastard! Say it again!"

Jake's face shook left and right as if it would be torn off. Thinking something terrible would happen if this continued, Shirone ran to Amy.

"Senior, please stop! You'll kill him at this rate!"

"Let go, you bastard! You thought you could look down on me!"

"I said you'll kill him!"

Jake heard the conversation through his fading consciousness. He couldn't feel pain, only dull impacts coming in.

'Kill me? I'm going to die?'

The fear of death awakened Jake's mind. He covered his face with both arms and screamed at the top of his lungs.

"Sp-spare me! Just spare my life! Please!"

Tears welled up in Amy's eyes. It had almost become a terrible situation. Thinking that she had been humiliated by such a piece of trash all this time made her blood boil.

"I'll never forgive you! You terrible bastard!"

"Senior, please stop!"

Shirone used all his strength to pull Amy away. Her Schema's physical balance was considerable, making it feel like pulling out a stake driven into the ground. Only when he pulled with all his might did Amy finally fall backward, crushing Shirone beneath her.

"That's enough now, Senior. Please stop."

Shirone exhaled roughly. As his mind cleared, he felt a soft and supple sensation against his arms. Realizing he was pressing against Amy's chest, he hurriedly removed his hands.

"S-sorry!"

Amy showed no reaction. She was only breathing roughly and trembling intermittently. As her emotions were transmitted through their contact, Shirone also felt sorry for her. He gently embraced her waist and spoke softly.

"Senior, because of me..."

"Ah! That's refreshing~!"

"Ugh!"

Amy sprang up like a spring, striking Shirone's lower abdomen hard with her bottom.

Shirone rolled over, clutching his stomach. If she had hit just a little lower, a terrible situation would have occurred.

"What's wrong? Are you hurt somewhere?"

Though he avoided a vital spot, the shock had traveled downward, causing cold sweat to form on his forehead. But he couldn't show it.

"No, it's nothing."

"Hehe! Of course you should be fine. I'm so light after all."

Having been curious since childhood, there was no way she didn't know Shirone's condition. It was her own way of showing intimacy, awkward as she was with emotional expression. It was also her way of overlooking Shirone's unintentionally successful improper contact.

"But what do we do now?"

Shirone changed the subject and turned his gaze to Black Magician. He hadn't noticed during the chaotic fight, but now that the commotion was over, their condition was serious.

They were all unconscious with bloody noses, and Jake was crawling on the ground in a half-dazed state.

Examining their sorry state, Amy decided to cover things up at this point. Though she wanted to have them expelled, if the incident escalated, Shirone's identity might be revealed.

"Let's go down. Those guys have their own guilty consciences, so they'll probably stay quiet from now on."

"But Senior Seriel will be coming this way, won't she?"

"What? Don't tell me you told a teacher?"

"Of course I did. How could I come alone when you were in danger?"

Amy sighed and pressed her forehead. She thought she could at least claim the spoils of victory, even if she had been humiliated. But hearing that the report was already done deflated her spirits.

Shirone felt deeply moved. The reason Amy was disappointed was to protect his secret.

"Senior, thank you."

"Huh?"

"You came alone because of me. But don't worry about it. Secrets and such don't matter anymore. I'm just glad you're safe."

"No, I wasn't doing it for..."

Amy scratched her cheek and averted her gaze. Growing up in the free-spirited atmosphere of the Carmis family, she had sometimes felt neglected. Longing for human affection, she had wandered through back alleys. For her, Shirone's kind words were something that felt good but couldn't be completely digested.

"Hmph! Who said it was because of you? These kinds of guys are nothing even alone. Actually, I'd been planning to deal with them anyway. They just got caught at the right time."

Amy's cheeks were completely red. Shirone was satisfied with that. He thought he understood what kind of person she was.

"Kekeke, so childish I can't stand watching. You call things like yourselves geniuses? Not in a million years. You're just brats who don't know how the world works."

Jake stood up, bracing himself against a tree. His face was battered, but his eyes were full of venom.

Amy put her hands on her hips and said, "You're really pathetic. If you can't even stand up properly, just lie there. You're not a pervert, so do you enjoy getting beaten by me that much?"

"Puhahahaha!"

In Jake's mind, there wasn't the slightest thought that he had lost. In the end, what rules the world is money. He might have lost the fight, but he still had tremendous financial power remaining.

"You think it's all over? No, it's just beginning. Be honest. You can't actually kill me, can you? If you're confident, try killing me. As long as I'm in this school, you'll never graduate. I'll destroy you by any means necessary!"

Shirone felt chilled. But Amy, who had dominated back alleys since childhood, knew people like Jake all too well.

"Kill you? Why would I kill you? My life is too bright and promising to waste on trash like you. But remember this: even if I can't kill you, I can beat you up."

As Amy clenched her fist and approached, Jake flinched. No matter how fiercely he steeled his mind, his body remembered the fear.

"...You think I'd be scared?"

"Who said anything? Since you got up, you need another beating. I'm still not satisfied."

As Amy noisily rolled her shoulders, Jake felt nauseous but his face contorted with fear.

Kiiiiiiiii!

A sharp friction sound pressed down from the sky. Shirone looked up, but the other two knew without looking.

It was the distinctive noise of spatial movement, an advanced form of short-range teleportation.

The moment he thought starlight was twinkling in the sky, a flash curved rapidly and descended toward Shirone's group.

Seriel landed with two teachers in tow.

Amy checked the teachers' faces with the feeling of scratching a lottery ticket. Then she sighed softly.

It was Siena of ice magic and Thad of flame magic.

'Oh no, of all people.'

Along with Ethella, they were the youngest faculty members at the magic school, and there was no way they would handle this incident lightly.

"Amy! Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?"

Seriel ran to Amy with tears in her eyes.

"Yeah, I'm fine. There's no way I'd go down easily."

With her meticulous personality, Seriel didn't miss small changes. Amy's bangs, which fell slightly to cover her right eye, were singed and damaged.

She had always thought Amy's hairstyle was too retro compared to her pretty appearance, but seeing her friend's hair that she'd maintained for six years ruined made her heart ache.

"What happened to your hair? What occurred here?"

"Oh please! I told you it's nothing. But is it already past seven?"

"What are you talking about? Do you know how long we searched for you? If it weren't for the teachers, we wouldn't have arrived in time."

The sun had already set and darkness was falling.

As the surroundings grew dark, Thad cast flame magic. A fireball shot up with a poof and burned in the air like a small sun.

'So this is Fire Sun magic.'

Shirone gazed at the sphere shining in the sky with admiration. Though the surroundings became as bright as midday, no heat was felt.

This was a phenomenon impossible without converting thermal energy to light energy. According to his memory from books, Fire Sun was deceptively advanced magic despite its appearance and was mainly seen on battlefields.

Thad approached Amy with a distressed expression.

"What is this about, Amy! How could such an outstanding student do something so foolish..."

With his personality of being weak only toward women, Thad seemed to pay no attention to Shirone. Especially for Amy, who was first in grades, from a First-class family, and first in appearance, he couldn't help but cherish her.

Feeling disgusted by Thad's attitude, Siena turned to Shirone.

"Shirone, could you explain what happened?"

"Uh, well, that is..."

"I'll explain it."

At Jake's words, the teachers turned their heads. The perpetrator of the incident wanted to explain? They wondered if he'd been beaten so badly his mind had gone strange.

But this too was Jake's calculation.

Disciplinary action could be endured. The school, which needed the Ardius family's financial power, would never expel him anyway.

But what about Shirone? He had clearly heard the earlier conversation about secrets. And Amy's behavior of trying to cover things up. In the end, it meant there was something they were hiding.

"I called Amy out. Her skills were so superior that I had no choice but to use Anti-Magic. But it was a fair duel. Our emotions had been building up for a while and it finally escalated into a matter of pride. As you can see, we're the ones who were seriously beaten."

Siena spoke with an unpleasant expression.

"You expect us to believe that now? You violated school rules."

"I'm not saying we did well. But think about it. If Amy was the victim, why didn't she report it? They tried to cover up the incident because they have something to hide too."

Amy shouted, "What nonsense! What are we hiding? You threatened that you'd kidnap Shirone!"

"Haha! So did we kidnap him? No. Moreover, even after reading the note we sent, Shirone didn't inform a teacher. What does this mean?"

"You, you bastard..."

Amy couldn't refute it. The fact that Shirone, who hadn't been kidnapped, came running without even reporting to a teacher was incomprehensible to those who didn't know the inside story. But if she told the truth, Shirone's secret would be revealed.
