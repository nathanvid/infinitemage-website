Jake was in high spirits. Look, this was what an adult fight looked like. This world was ultimately won by the ruthless, dirty, and underhanded.

'Heh heh heh. Farewell, Amy. Even if I fall to hell, I'll drag you down with me.'

"Don't get cocky, Jake."

Siena spoke with cold eyes.

"I heard about it from Seriel before coming. You won't be able to attend school anymore."

"Don't jump to conclusions. You're a teacher who instructs students, not part of the administration, right?"

"What?"

"You know how much the Ardius family contributes, don't you? It's more than the support funds from ten First-class nobles combined. Do you really think they can expel me under those circumstances?"

Noble schools mostly operated on a donation system. This was to maintain expensive equipment. If equipment became outdated, students' achievement levels would drop. Poor grades would cost them their prestigious title, creating a vicious cycle where talented students would avoid enrolling.

While schools with history and tradition could endure to some degree, Alpheas Magic School was a rising prestigious institution that had been established only 30 years ago, making nobles' support funds desperately needed.

The person who knew this fact better than anyone was Thad, a graduate of Alpheas Magic School. If the money supported by Jake's family disappeared, they would inevitably suffer financially.

"Teacher Siena, I think it's premature to talk about expulsion already. Shouldn't such matters be decided by opening a disciplinary committee?"

"No. Jake will be expelled. If I can't expel him, I won't have the face to look at the students who withdrew. If Jake remains at school, I'll take responsibility as a teacher and resign."

Thad hastily erased the image of Siena resigning that had popped into his mind. Though he didn't like her cold personality, she was a woman whose magical talent he acknowledged as remarkable. Her leaving the school would be a completely different matter from Jake's expulsion.

Jake shrugged his shoulders and laughed.

"Hahaha! You'll quit school? Go ahead and try! Let's see whether you leave or I leave."

Frost began rising from Siena's shoulders. True to her nature as an ice mage, her anger was as cold as ice.

"Where do you think teachers' salaries come from? How are the library's books purchased? The money to establish training grounds? The expensive magical devices? In the end, the world is about money! Money! There's nothing in this world that can't be done with money!"

At that moment, Siena swept her hand from bottom to top. Jake looked around his feet in bewilderment. He felt a cold wind, then a chill raced across the ground in a circle.

"Gah!"

Realizing it was an Ice Tornado that could freeze wind even in the atmosphere, Jake crouched and covered his face.

Crack-crack-crack-crack-crack!

The whirlwind of cold air ascended, trapping Jake. As the air froze, hundreds of long spikes protruded.

"Uuuugh!"

Sharp icicles grazed Jake's face, shoulders, sides, and legs. Jake couldn't move a finger, trapped as if in a mold.

'Wow! Amazing.'

Shirone was genuinely impressed. Even if a mage was omnipotent, controlling freezing phenomena down to the molecular level was difficult. The rumors about her being a genius mage coveted by the royal palace weren't exaggerated.

"A student lecturing a teacher? There are plenty of things in this world that money can't buy."

Jake wrinkled his nose like a wolf. There was nothing in the world that money couldn't buy. He had grown up watching countless times how even the most noble people would turn into beasts when gold was dangled before their eyes.

"There are things money can't buy? What exactly would that be?"

"Talent."

Jake flinched. Siena had struck his most painful spot with the coldest precision.

"Character. Personality. Beliefs. Intelligence. Friendship. Effort. Honor. Should I tell you more?"

Jake wanted to scream. Why was this woman tormenting him? If only he could shut her mouth, he wouldn't mind pouring out any amount of money.

When Siena flicked her finger, the Ice Tornado shattered into pieces. Ice fragments struck Jake's face.

"Uuuugh..."

Terrified, Jake couldn't even open his eyes. He had the delusion that his face might be completely destroyed.

"Now you understand, Jake? Money can't buy anything. That's why you can't have anything."

Siena grabbed Jake by the collar and pulled him close.

"Hieek!"

"Don't be mistaken. School isn't a place that teaches you in exchange for money. School is the only place that teaches things money can't buy. You've kicked away such a precious space with your own feet. If you leave school, no one will teach you these things."

Jake's heart sank. He had never thought about it before. The situation where he truly couldn't attend school anymore.

Siena would definitely expel him. Then he wouldn't be able to challenge anything. He would become a loser, and ultimately his life would end too.

'It's over. I am...'

His face turned pale, and gradually the appearance of a boy began to show. Jake, who looked like he might burst into tears at any moment, knelt at Siena's feet and shed bitter tears.

"I was wrong, teacher. I was wrong. Please don't expel me. Give me just one more chance. I won't do it again. From now on, I'll really study hard."

Shirone's group became solemn. They knew how terrifying it was to be cast out into the world as a student.

Siena bent her knees and helped Jake to his feet.

"When the disciplinary committee convenes, sincerely apologize for your wrongs. To put everything back in its place, you need that kind of resolve. The teacher will be on your side, so let's work through this one step at a time."

"Thank you! Thank you!"

Shirone realized anew that there were so many things money couldn't buy. Even all the many students here ultimately had to run on their own strength to achieve their goals.

What did it matter if they were commoners or nobles?

The dreams we're all looking toward are also things that money can never buy.

* * *

The Black Magician members were confined to punishment rooms and received treatment.

The disciplinary committee was scheduled to convene tomorrow, and Shirone's group was given a separate meeting time with the teachers.

While Thad was writing up the report, Shirone gave a detailed account of how he had subdued the Black Magicians. As expected, the teachers' eyes widened in amazement.

"What? You suppressed Anti-Magic with Spirit Zone?"

"Yes. I heard from Teacher Ethella that Anti-Magic by mages is a mental power contest and dangerous to cast carelessly. So I think I unconsciously tried to endure in defensive form."

Everyone except Amy was speechless with shock.

Of course, Anti-Magic was difficult to achieve full efficiency in if it wasn't your specialty. But even considering that, it was a simultaneous attack by five people.

It would have been impossible unless Shirone's Spirit Zone was stronger than all the Black Magicians combined.

Siena leaned her face close to Shirone's. She lifted his eyelids to examine his pupils, then sighed in relief when no abnormal findings were discovered.

"You must never do that again in the future. Anti-Magic is much more dangerous than you think. You got through safely this time, but you could have lost the ability to use magic if you weren't careful."

Even the stout-hearted Shirone felt his heart sink when Siena told him this directly. Indeed, at that time he had only thought about protecting Amy.

Amy quietly averted her gaze. Since she was the one who had put Shirone in danger, it was natural for her to feel guilty.

Siena rested her chin on her hand and fell into thought. In any case, suppressing Anti-Magic was remarkable talent. She had known from the beginning that his endurance was exceptional, but she hadn't expected it to be to this degree.

On the other hand, Thad was displeased. His insides twisted at the thought that Shirone had succeeded at something even Amy couldn't accomplish.

With such feelings, Thad spoke.

"Shirone, why didn't you report it immediately? When something like that happens, you should have reported to a teacher. No matter how I think about it, I can't understand going alone to rescue a senior whose class is much higher than yours."

Shirone and Amy thought that what had to come had finally come.

This time, even Siena didn't stop Thad. With a student having withdrawn due to the Black Magicians' misdeeds, they needed to resolve even small doubts before moving forward.

Shirone smiled and nodded at Amy, who looked at him as if asking his intentions. Even if the secret was revealed, he wouldn't resent her.

Amy sighed helplessly and spoke.

"Fine. I'll tell you the truth."

The person most curious about Shirone's secret was Seriel. Just how long had the two of them known each other? No, more than that, why was Amy protecting Shirone?

"Actually, Shirone is..."

As everyone waited for the following words, Amy suddenly scratched her head with a bright smile.

"My boyfriend."

"Whaaaat?"

The room shook as if it might collapse at the completely unexpected answer.

Thad pressed her in disbelief.

"Since when exactly? You never showed any interest in romance. Moreover, Shirone is a new student who just entered school?"

"We met when we were young. Then our connection continued again here. Haha! It's a common thing, isn't it?"

Amy deliberately acted playfully. This would do it. She would be entering the graduating class anyway, and with different class schedules, there wouldn't be many occasions to encounter Shirone.

The school would be buzzing for a while, but it wasn't a bad thing. Once they knew she was taken, the male students who pestered her would decrease too.

Even she thought it was an excellent improvisation.

On the other hand, Shirone, who was on the receiving end, felt his heart pounding. Amy was a senior and the object of students' admiration. He knew it was a lie to handle the immediate situation, but it was still an enormous burden.

"Right, Shirone?"

Amy turned around with an eye smile. It was obvious she was forcing herself to smile. He could almost hear her mental voice saying she'd kill him if he didn't answer quickly.

"Ah! Yes, that's right."

"Kyaaah! How could this happen? I'm completely shocked, no, moved!"

Seriel slapped her own cheeks rapidly and spoke quickly.

"Hoho, I knew it all along! No wonder this one acted coy whenever she saw Shirone. Since when have you been dating? Who confessed first?"

When even Seriel, Amy's friend, believed it, the teachers couldn't doubt it either. If they were lovers, it wasn't incomprehensible that he would chase after the Black Magicians with youthful passion.

Thad pulled at his hair while writing the report.

"The victims of this incident, Shirone and Amy, are in a h-healthy relationship..."

* * *

The rumor spread in an instant.

Now there wasn't a student at Alpheas Magic School who didn't know that Shirone and Amy were lovers. While the notice posted about the Black Magicians' misdeeds played a part, the heroic tale from the chatterbox Seriel's mouth was what really stirred hearts.

Shirone, who infiltrated enemy territory alone to protect his lover. Though the Black Magicians responded with Anti-Magic, he overcame it with the power of love and rescued Amy.

The rumor was that the villain boss Jake was overwhelmed by Shirone's gaze and begged forgiveness while shedding tears and snot. The gist of the story was that the two shared a deep kiss in the mountains under the pouring moonlight.

"Seriel! Do you want to die? What kind of rumors have you been spreading?"

"Giggle giggle! Why? It's roughly the right story!"

"It's not even roughly right! When did I ever kiss Shirone?"

"Oh my, such coyness. If you're dating, you would have kissed at least that much, right? If I'm going to embellish it, that much needs to be included!"

"What are you, some playwright? Why are you arbitrarily embellishing other people's stories?"

"It worked out well, didn't it? Those annoying boys who used to bother you don't come near anymore."
