Amy was satisfied with that aspect as well. The rumor wasn't just about dating—it had escalated to them sharing a kiss, so the shock among the male students would be considerable.

"What are you doing today? When are you going to see Shirone? Huh? Huh?"

"I don't know. We decided to focus on our studies for the time being."

A hint of disappointment crept into Amy's tone.

'Even if it's a fake relationship, with rumors like this spreading, how can he be so indifferent?'

Amy's pride was hurt by Shirone's stone-like attitude. She wasn't a princess complex case, but whenever she looked in the mirror, she thought her looks were certainly not something to be ignored. Yet Shirone seemed genuinely uninterested, focusing only on his studies. Even if it was a fake relationship, they were officially a couple. She might be fine as a girl, but shouldn't a guy be at least a little conscious of it?

"I don't know! I'm not going to care either. I have mountains of work to do—where am I wasting my attention?"

"You're disappointed after all, aren't you? Shirone really is too much though. Neglecting such a pretty girlfriend like this. If it were me, I'd stick to you all day. Oh my! Perhaps it's exactly that kind of attitude that moved Amy's iron-walled heart?"

"Seriel..."

Seeing Amy's eyes turn red with anger, Seriel broke out in a cold sweat and waved her hands.

"Haha. Got it. That's enough!"

Amy exhaled sharply, releasing her anger. In a way, Shirone was properly grasping the situation. If his mind wandered to inappropriate places, there would be no point in having gone through a fake relationship to chase away the male students.

"Oh my! Amy, isn't that Jake over there?"

Jake was coming down the hill path. His face was covered with bandages, and he carried a large backpack on his shoulder.

By the disciplinary committee's decision, the Black Magician had received a two-year suspension. It was conditional on apologizing to the students who had withdrawn, but it was clearly an exceptional lenient punishment.

"Hey! Long time no see, Amy."

For someone being expelled from school, Jake's face was bright.

"You still haven't left? How persistent."

"Kekeke! I've done so many bad things that I have many places to say goodbye to."

"Did you have some uncharacteristic change of heart? Come on. Does a person's personality change that easily?"

"Well, that's true. But there's someone who believes in even someone like me. So now I can't do bad things anymore."

The story of Siena fighting hard in the committee to lower Jake's disciplinary level was famous among the students. Without her, the Black Magician would not have avoided expulsion.

"But what will you do from now on? If you rest for two years, your class will drop too."

"I have to apologize to the kids who withdrew. They probably won't forgive me, but I'm prepared for that. After I set everything right, I guess I'll figure out what to do next."

Amy thought it wouldn't be easy. Most of the children who suffered under Jake were First-class nobility and had suffered irreparable psychological wounds.

The possibility of being beaten to death couldn't be completely ruled out either.

Jake would know this fact better than anyone. But far from being afraid, he actually seemed relieved.

"I should get going. By the time I return, you'll have graduated. I don't know when the opportunity will come, but when it does, I'll do my best too. Take care. Have a good love."

As Jake waved and turned around, Amy responded with a bitter smile. It was ridiculous that even Jake, the person involved in the incident, thought she was actually dating Shirone.

Anyway, seeing him leave in such a shabby state felt bitter as a fellow student. After thinking for a moment, she remembered something and called out to Jake.

"Hey, Jake."

Jake turned around.

"Two years is nothing. Don't give up."

"Haha! If you have any troubles, contact me. I can lend you as much money as you need."

Bragging about money until the very end, the insufferable guy. But on the other hand, she thought it was very Jake-like. Honestly, if he had been crying and whining, she might have thrown a punch.

"Two years... Yeah, it really would be nothing."

Amy watched Jake disappear into the distance and thought. He couldn't attend school for at least two years. But what meaning was there in that? In the world of magic, if you lacked skill, you'd rot in the same place for life anyway.

"Seriel, I've made up my mind."

"Huh? Going to see Shirone?"

"I'm going to apply for graduation class advancement."

"What? Already? Isn't it too early?"

Once you enter Class Four, you automatically qualify to apply for graduation class. However, if you fail the advancement exam, you can't apply again that year, so the competition is fierce from the beginning of the semester.

Even if you pass the advancement exam, graduation is still far away. The graduation class is where only the most outstanding talents can enter, even within the magic school where geniuses gather.

Magic school graduates recall the graduation class as a battlefield more intense than society itself. It was a place where childhood friendships were temporarily set aside and only thirty prospective mages engaged in a survival competition.

Some criticize this infinite competition system, but considering the special nature of the profession, it's unavoidable.

Alpheas Magic School is a state-designated institution, so graduating gives you an unofficial certificate and recognition as a formal mage. In other words, it meant being "immediately combat-ready" personnel deployed directly to the social front lines.

In the worst case, having to navigate between life and death on battlefields, the teachers' common opinion was that strict standards had to be applied to the graduation class.

"How about waiting a little? The quota is still wide open, and it wouldn't be too late to apply after analyzing the graduation class level and trends, right?"

"No, I don't want to hesitate. Right now I want to run forward looking only ahead."

Knowing Amy's stubbornness, Seriel couldn't dissuade her further. On the other hand, she was also curious about how far Amy's genius would extend in the graduation class.

"Alright, I'll support you. You can do it if it's you."

"Thanks. I'll go up first and check out the atmosphere."

"Hehe, actually I'm a bit anxious, so I'm thinking of gathering information first. Anyway, let's work hard."

"Yeah. I'll help you too."

Amy looked up at the blue sky with a relieved heart.

Dreams are as far away as the sun. But like the sun, they illuminate oneself with brilliant light and guide the path for all who look upward.

'I will definitely become the greatest mage.'

**Eyesore (1)**

The time for advanced class integrated lessons had come around again.

Even while upperclassmen and underclassmen were mingling, no one approached Shirone.

Sometimes standing out too much was also a problem.

He had surprised the teachers in the entrance test and succeeded with the Four-Direction Style in his first class. He had crushed the Black Magician and become the official boyfriend of Amy, the object of admiration.

In a short time, Shirone had left considerable footprints. Yet he still belonged to Class Seven, the lowest in the advanced class, so his classmates' feelings couldn't help but be complicated.

"Oh! There he is, Amy. Your boyfriend. Shirone!"

Seriel waved from afar. Shirone pushed through the crowd and approached. Amy stood with her arms crossed, looking sulky.

"Hello, senior."

"Hohoho! This kid. Still calling me senior? We're not strangers and we're the same age anyway, so speak casually, speak casually."

Even while Seriel's matchmaking instincts were activating, Amy's reaction was sullen. From some point on, she had felt that Shirone was not just indifferent but actually avoiding her.

It wasn't boasting, but if it was Carmis Amy, there wasn't a man at school who would reject her. On the other hand, she had countless times worried about how to respond if Shirone approached her sincerely.

But what about Shirone? He drew lines as if she were worse than a friend, not even giving her a glance beyond businesslike conversation.

"Haha! Still, I can't do that. You're clearly my senior."

At Shirone's calm response, Amy almost used her fists. But she held back. Getting angry here would be admitting she lacked charm.

"Just call me casually when we're alone. It's ridiculous to call me senior when we're dating."

At Amy's trembling voice, Seriel realized anew the power of love. She who would be a corpse without her pride was swallowing her anger to try to win Shirone's favor. It would normally be impossible.

"No, it's fine. Well then, I'll go listen to the lesson."

As Shirone returned to his seat, Amy felt like crying from frustration and embarrassment.

"Fine! Handle it yourself! If you hate it that much, then don't do it!"

Seriel chased after Amy as she walked away. Even to her, Shirone's recent attitude seemed strange.

"Amy, did you fight with Shirone by any chance?"

"I don't know! I don't care anymore! He thinks he's so great!"

Shirone suppressed his apologetic feelings and returned to Class Seven. Amy was a good person. But there were too many obstacles to being close friends with the top student of Class Four.

As Shirone took his seat, his classmates murmured.

"So great, so great. Does he want to show off that badly?"

"Even during class time he's playing at romance? He has no skill whatsoever but got into school relying on his face?"

Their jealousy was much more severe than Shirone had expected.

The average age of Class Seven was fifteen. They were younger compared to Shirone. Especially at this age, a one-year difference shows a big gap, making it a group where immature incidents frequently occurred.

The children didn't like that a newly enrolled newcomer had been chosen by Amy, the top student of the advanced class. As mob psychology took effect, now even female students were badmouthing Shirone.

"My eyes must have been wrong. Isn't he a complete playboy? He doesn't study and only does romance, so he still can't cast a single magic spell."

Shirone decided to distance himself from Amy. It could deal a fatal blow to her image as well.

It would be a lie to say he didn't feel bad about the numerous criticisms. Recently the degree had worsened and he was starting to get annoyed.

But whenever that happened, he endured by recalling Temuran's advice. The only thing he could do now was to advance to a higher class as quickly as possible.

"From today we'll reduce theory classes and focus on practical training. Practice your Four-Direction Style specialty for one hour, and use the remaining time to practice pattern changes."

At Ethella's instruction, students gathered to train the Four-Direction Style. But Shirone couldn't mix with them.

Early on, he had carelessly deployed his Spirit Zone and suffered embarrassment. The children had avoided his spot, loathing Shirone's Spirit Zone transmitted through synesthesia as if it were filth.

Shirone moved to a secluded spot. Since he possessed the largest Spirit Zone in Class Seven, this was the only way to train comfortably.

After training the defensive form for an hour, Shirone practiced the remaining three patterns. The offensive form was decent though not as good as defensive, while the target form was difficult.

The biggest problem was the separation form. Forget the difficulty—he couldn't even imitate it.

'This is really tricky. How exactly does one achieve separation?'

He tried to separate his Spirit Zone to the right, but all that happened was the form becoming distorted. The saying that even in the upper classes, students who could execute the separation form could be counted on one hand wasn't an exaggeration.

'Center. Moving the center is the key.'

Shirone corrected the error and tried again. With the Spirit Zone's form fixed, he slowly moved the center.

A dizzying feeling swept over him with a whirring sound. Would it feel like this if one's soul left the body? His consciousness became distant and his senses grew remote. Just before achieving separation, the Spirit Zone burst like an air bubble.

"Phew!"

He could only think that it was too difficult. The mind leaving the body wasn't a natural phenomenon. Therefore, it had to be approached very technically.

'Should I try moving the center first? No, the first method is correct. If the form isn't perfect, the center won't move.'

As Shirone struggled, Ethella personally approached him.

"Shirone, how is it going?"

"The separation form is difficult. The part about moving the center isn't easy."

"That's probably the case. For someone who's convergence-type like you, it's like a polar opposite. The Four-Direction Style is a natural phenomenon, but only the separation form is unnatural. By the way, how are the other Four-Direction Style patterns?"

Ethella didn't expect even the separation form from Shirone. What she expected from him was his natural insight, not artificial calculation ability.

"Hmm. The rest... don't seem to have any particular problems."

Shirone answered honestly. Even in his opinion, he was becoming satisfyingly skilled at Four-Direction Style pattern conversion.
