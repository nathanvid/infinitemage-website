Ethella touched her lips thoughtfully, lost in contemplation.

"Then would you like to demonstrate in the Image Zone?"

"What? Right now?"

"Why? Are you not feeling well?"

"No, it's not that, but..."

Ethella blinked in confusion. The enthusiastic student who had wanted to use the Image Zone from the very first day of class had been passive in lessons lately.

'What could be going on? His expression doesn't look good. The kids seem to be giving him a hard time—is that the reason? He's more sensitive than I thought.'

Ethella patted his shoulder reassuringly.

"If you're not feeling well, we can do it next time. You're the only one in Class Seven who can perform Four-Direction Style transformations, so I just wanted to take a look."

"No, I'll do it. Please evaluate me."

Shirone changed his mind. Even if his classmates criticized him, he wouldn't throw away the opportunity to receive guidance from Teacher Ethella for such a reason.

When Shirone entered the Image Zone, harsh words flew at him.

"Oh? Is he planning to do it again? He's just desperate to show off."

"He probably wants to look good in front of his girlfriend. Well, that's the only thing that brat is good at. He can't do jack when it comes to actual magic."

Meanwhile, the upperclassmen stopped their practice and turned their attention to him. A month had passed since he succeeded with the defensive form of the Four-Direction Style, so they were curious about his growth.

"Teacher, I'll begin."

"Alright. Let's try them one by one first."

Shirone demonstrated his specialty, the defensive form. A massive icosahedral polyhedron formed with sturdy presence.

The upperclassmen let out exclamations of admiration.

"Just looking at the defensive form, it's upper-class level. That's practically armor-grade."

In contrast, the Class Seven students glared at Shirone as if he were a public enemy. Still, they couldn't grumble because it truly was an impressive level.

Shirone deployed the Four-Direction Style into offensive form. The zone's size decreased while countless spikes protruded menacingly.

Next was the target form. The cross's length was considerable, but its rotational force was weak for practical use. Even so, the expression "remarkable progress" wasn't lacking in describing it.

Ethella smiled with satisfaction. His skill was at a level where early promotion to Class Six would be perfectly acceptable.

Shirone didn't stop there and attempted the separation form. To receive advice from Ethella, it was important to show his failures as well.

Inevitably, difficulties crashed down on him. The Spirit Zone's form would change, and even when he shifted the center, the zone would burst just before separation.

Ethella's eyes lit up with surprise. She hadn't even expected it since it was contrary to his nature, but he was getting somewhere close.

Meanwhile, the Class Seven children who hadn't even thought of attempting the separation form each let out sighs of relief.

"Heh heh, what's he even doing? What kind of Four-Direction Style is that? It's child's play."

"I thought he was supposed to be a genius, but he's nothing special. He should at least be good at something. How's he going to become a mage like that?"

Shirone felt hurt. Not a single person in Class Seven could perform the separation form. He couldn't understand the mindset of applying standards they themselves couldn't meet to others.

As he lost his composure, the Spirit Zone wavered. The more it did, the more his classmates became furious and didn't stop their malicious gossip to bring Shirone down.

Amy, who had been watching the demonstration, frowned. The Four-Direction Style transformations had been satisfactory, but suddenly the zone was shaking.

"Why is he acting like that? What's he doing?"

"The separation form is naturally difficult. He's probably too conscious of the kids' reactions."

"No way. He's not the type to be shaken by that. Is there really something going on with him lately?"

"My, how protective. Well, since he's your boyfriend, of course you'd think that way."

Amy blushed and silenced Seriel, then fell into thought. It was definitely strange. Where had the endurance that overcame Anti-Magic gone? His Spirit Zone was swaying like a drunk person.

'Is there really something I don't know about?'

Shirone struggled desperately to suppress his emotions. But anger, once born, is difficult to control because it grows by devouring oneself.

'Why do they hate me? What did I do wrong? I just want to learn earnestly and do better. What's wrong with wanting to become a mage?'

The Spirit Zone began to fluctuate as if it would burst at any moment.

"Hey, you're thinking too much."

Shirone snapped out of his reverie. Someone from Class Five had spoken.

"If there's something you want to do, just do it. You came here to learn magic, didn't you?"

Shirone finally looked at his condition with a clear head. Now that he'd come to his senses, he realized acutely how foolish his thoughts had been.

'What was I doing?'

Having erased his distracting thoughts, Shirone attempted the separation form. It was fine to fail, and better to succeed. What mattered was advancing one step further through it.

The 40-meter diameter zone slowly began to move away from its center. The farther the center moved, the more the diameter decreased exponentially.

Which would come first—separation or dissolution?

All the advanced class students stared intently at the scene.

When the zone's size had shrunk to a 2-meter diameter, the Spirit Zone's surface completely separated from Shirone's body.

The shock the Class Seven students received was indescribable. Having succeeded at a technique that even advanced class seniors found difficult, it was natural for their minds to go blank.

The Spirit Zone began to rapidly circle around Shirone. New information flooded in every moment. The massive amount of information felt like his head would burst. When he opened his eyes wide, the Spirit Zone popped and vanished without a trace.

"Hah, hah."

Though he hadn't done anything, he was out of breath.

"I did it. I really succeeded at... the separation form."

The advanced classes began to stir.

This was an incomparable achievement to succeeding at the defensive form. Not only in Class Seven, but not even one person in Class Six had succeeded at the separation form.

Seriel shook Amy's arm, making a fuss.

"Amy, Shirone did it! He really did it."

Amy was smiling too. Whatever her feelings, as a colleague running toward the same dream, it was talent worthy of respect.

'His growth rate is tremendous. No, it's really too fast. If he can succeed at the separation form in just one month, surely...'

Talent that matches mine. Or perhaps even greater.

Amy felt a bit frustrated. Shirone must have trained his mind without missing a single day. But what about herself? She'd been wandering back alleys engaging in delinquent behavior.

'Why did I... waste such precious time so meaninglessly?'

Shirone, having succeeded at the separation form, looked around toward Class Five to find the owner of the advice. But since he had no opportunity to converse with the upperclassmen, he couldn't tell who it was from the voice alone.

'I wanted to say thank you...'

Ethella watched Shirone receiving applause and fell into thought. Everyone was being stimulated by Shirone's growth. A method to further boost the class atmosphere came to mind.

"Hmm, it came sooner than I thought."

* * *

Lately, Shirone had a secret worry. It was that he didn't know how to use a single magic spell.

The knowledge required for magic wasn't something that lower-class children could possess so easily. That's why the school only conducted full-scale magic practice starting from Class Five.

But reality was different. Since nobles received education from birth, even lower-class students knew how to use at least one magic spell. In contrast, Shirone's study period was only the year and six months at the Ozent family home.

Shirone's dilemma lay here. If he focused on one field of study, he might be able to use simple magic. But with the same methods as others, he could never surpass students who had been educated from childhood.

That's how he came up with the strategy of studying entire fields of study along with other studies that branched from one subject.

As a result, the number of books he needed to borrow increased, so lately he practically lived in the Great Library with a permanent spot.

Students mocked such a Shirone. They thought it was stupid to study haphazardly when he couldn't even keep up with current classes.

But Shirone didn't change his mind. With a spine of knowledge, any field of study could be arranged according to the order of time. In other words, the probability of forgetting content was significantly reduced.

'The immediate results may be minimal. But at least two years. If it's possible to study like this for two years, all the core knowledge of each field will be connected.'

This was the framework of knowledge. An entire encyclopedia that could access any information would enter his head completely.

Shirone renewed his determination and dove back into books. When he came to his senses, it was well past midnight. The only person remaining in the reading room was a girl from Class Six.

When Shirone packed his bag and bowed his head politely, she also bowed back with a shy smile.

When he left the Great Library, it was 2 AM.

Even if he went in now, he could sleep for about four hours. But thinking that his studies were behind those of noble family children made even sleeping time feel precious.

At such times, Shirone would recall a book he'd once read called "Conversations with Great Scholars."

Among them, an interview with a biologist named Torkcolin was particularly impressive. He claimed that humans must get at least six hours of sleep, but at the end of the interview, he made this joke:

"Of course, during my school days, I only got four hours of sleep."

The book's author asked:

"Then isn't your research wrong? You became an outstanding scholar sleeping only four hours."

Torkcolin's answer was this:

"Haha! Teenagers aren't human. They're superhuman. Whether they sleep or not won't matter at all."

These were words that gave great courage to Shirone, who was pressed for time.

'That's right! Let's work hard. If I do my best, results will follow.'

Lights were on in the graduating class building. The windows flickered as if magic experiments were being conducted late into the night. What kind of new magic was being created in there?

Shirone's gaze was already directed toward the graduating class.

* * *

Near the end of lunch break, Ethella came looking for Siena. Though they were the same age at 26 and had worked together for four years already, they still spoke formally to each other.

"Teacher Siena, could you spare some time?"

"Yes. But I have Class Seven scheduled, so I don't think we can talk for long."

Since discussions about magic often stretched well over an hour, Siena asked for understanding in advance.

"Ah, I see. I have something to discuss regarding Shirone."

At the mention of Shirone, Siena also showed interest. She'd heard that while his performance in her theory classes was lacking, he was showing promise in Ethella's practical sessions.

"How has he been lately? Looking at his practical scores, they seem quite high."

"That's certainly true. Last time, he even succeeded at the separation form of the Four-Direction Style."

"Oh, is that so?"

Siena smiled with satisfaction. As Shirone's homeroom teacher, receiving praise from another teacher was a pleasant matter.

"So I'd like to make a proposal to Teacher Siena."

"What? A proposal?"

It was quite rare for Ethella to make suggestions to another homeroom teacher about a student. Thinking it must be something quite significant, Siena blinked.

* * *

Chemical theories were written densely on the blackboard of Class Seven's classroom. Students taking notes moved their eyes and hands busily. They felt today's class was particularly fast. As expected, Siena, who finished class about ten minutes early, came down from the podium.

"Let's stop here for today. However, I have an announcement to make."

The students showed great magnanimity. As long as class ended early, they could listen even to ghost stories.

"An early promotion candidate has been decided. Arian Shirone, please stand up."

Shirone was startled by the sudden early promotion. Meanwhile, his classmates wore unpleasant expressions. Early promotion wasn't extremely rare. But the problem was that the target was Shirone.

"Student Shirone will advance to Class Five. Starting tomorrow, attend classes according to that timetable. I hope the rest of you will also work harder to earn such opportunities. That's all."
