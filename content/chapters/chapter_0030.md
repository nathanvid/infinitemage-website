The classroom buzzed with excitement. Class Five? He hadn't just been promoted early—he had jumped up two entire levels at once. This was an unprecedented decision, not just for the students but for the school as well.

"Teacher! I object. How can Shirone advance two whole classes? Shirone can't use a single spell."

This was news to Siena. Even Ethella had never mentioned this to her. Perhaps she didn't know either. After all, there was no particular need to use magic in the lower-level classes.

"Is that true, Shirone?"

His classmates turned to look at Shirone. Their eyes seemed to be saying:

*Please say you can't do it. Please say you can't.*

"Yes. I don't have any magic I can cast yet."

"Hmm."

Even so, there was no problem with the early promotion. Magic was taught in earnest starting from the advanced classes, and the lower-class curriculum was focused entirely on strengthening one's Spirit Zone.

Shirone had mastered all the basics of the Four-Direction Style, and his Spirit Zone's size and durability were not inferior even compared to the advanced classes. Therefore, if they were to determine his proper class level, Class Five would be appropriate.

However, it was still unusual that he couldn't cast magic yet. Students would typically try magic secretly on their own, even without being taught. After all, these were children who had entered magic school because they desperately wanted to learn magic.

"I'm curious about this too. However, there are no magic evaluation criteria up to Class Six. Shirone's early promotion will proceed normally."

"I absolutely cannot accept this!"

Mark, the unofficial leader of Class Seven, shot up from his seat. He was a student with a large build and a strong square jaw to match his imposing frame.

"Why are you showing favoritism to one student? Please provide convincing evidence. Teacher, you yourself said that omniscience is just as important as omnipotence! Applying special conditions only to Shirone is incomprehensible from a common-sense perspective!"

"That's right! Honestly, I'm confident I could beat Shirone in academic competition right now! Shirone can't even keep up properly with the theory classes!"

"If you promote Shirone early, I'll petition the student council to hold a hearing!"

The students' backlash was much fiercer than expected. Though young, these were all children who had climbed up through competition starting from Class Ten. They had hoped to be stimulated through Shirone this time as well, but instead they were burning with hostility as if facing an enemy.

*'There's something I don't know about.'*

From the children's expressions, as if they would wage war itself, Siena realized the situation was serious. If the resistance was this severe, it could actually have a negative impact on the class atmosphere.

"This matter hasn't been officially decided yet. The exact announcement will be made after going through the faculty meeting. That's all for today's class."

Returning to the faculty office, Siena rested her chin on her hand and fell into thought.

Due to the nature of specialized schools, competition was inevitable. The students also knew this fact and had voluntarily enrolled.

*'What exactly is it? Those strange looks in the children's eyes?'*

It wasn't simple jealousy. Early promotions had existed for a long time, but never had the backlash been this severe.

"Excuse me, Teacher Siena."

A female student named Maria came looking for Siena.

She was a 19-year-old girl, the oldest in Class Seven, who had been unable to advance for four years and was stuck in the same place.

It wasn't that she completely lacked talent, but she had a timid personality and was very fearful, so the school was watching her with sympathy.

"Hm? What is it, Maria?"

"Actually... I have something to tell you."

After hesitating for a long while, Maria laid everything bare. How Shirone was currently being treated in class, and why the children had gotten so angry just moments before.

As the story progressed, Siena's brow furrowed deeper. The methods being used to torment Shirone were too malicious to be considered mere emotional conflicts.

Whenever they encountered Shirone, they would make retching motions as if by agreement, and there were countless cases of them intentionally gathering around Shirone to talk among themselves.

Maria finished her story in tears.

"Right now no one pays attention to me since I'm the oldest, but I actually experienced that kind of thing too. Back then, I couldn't focus on studying or anything else. I think Shirone is amazing. How can he stay so calm in that situation?"

Siena grasped the full extent of the situation. One student was being ostracized by the group. If fair competition couldn't take place, there was no reason for the school to exist.

"Thank you for telling me. From now on, I'll take care of it."

Shirone arrived at his dormitory around midnight. Since the talk of early promotion had come up, the children's ostracism had become even worse, so it seemed better to come back early and read books instead.

*Knock knock.*

Someone knocked on his door. Checking the time, it was already past 1 AM.

*'Who could it be at this hour?'*

Students couldn't go out, and the staff had already left for the day. Could it be that the children had come all the way here to torment him?

With an anxious heart, he hesitated to approach, when a familiar voice came from beyond the door.

"Shirone, are you sleeping?"

"Teacher Siena?"

Shirone hurriedly opened the door. It really was Siena.

"May I come in?"

"Ah, yes. Please come in."

Was today Teacher Siena's duty day? She must have washed up at the dormitory, as her hair still had moisture in it.

The advanced class dormitory also housed students in their early twenties, so it wasn't a place for a female teacher to be coming and going late at night. However, Siena had chosen this time to meet secretly without the other students knowing.

Unlike other male students' rooms, everything was organized with military precision. Guessing at Shirone's personality, she checked the books spread out on his desk one by one. There were textbooks, but mostly a pile of books from fields he didn't need to study yet.

*'So that's how it is. His way of thinking really is different.'*

Though it seemed like he had just spread out random books, to someone who understood the whole picture, they were from fields that were extremely closely related.

Siena began to faintly understand why Shirone still couldn't cast magic. It wasn't that he couldn't—he wasn't trying to.

*'He was weak in omniscience from the time he enrolled. He's desperately seeking ways to compensate for his shortcomings. This child doesn't want to learn magic. He wants to become a magician.'*

Siena supported Shirone's approach. Connecting knowledge to knowledge was a difficult process, but the fruit was great. Connected knowledge was not forgotten.

"Um, Teacher. Should I make you some tea?"

"No, it's fine. I came because I wanted to ask you something."

As Siena sat on the edge of the bed, Shirone pulled over his desk chair. This was the first time seeing her face so close up. Perhaps because she was in casual clothes with her hair down, she looked much younger than at school. Somehow feeling embarrassed, he quietly lowered his head.

Siena observed him calmly.

*'He's quite shy. Is this his original personality?'*

Since Shirone in class focused as if he would bore holes in the teacher's face, this side of him was unfamiliar.

"Isn't school life difficult for you?"

"No, it's fun. I enjoy studying too."

"Why didn't you say anything? I heard the children are tormenting you."

Shirone had already expected this. In fact, it would have been strange not to know. Recently, the children had been openly tormenting him.

"It's okay. You don't need to worry."

Having heard about the children's harassment from Maria in detail, Siena didn't believe Shirone's words.

"You can speak honestly about things like this. It's not shameful."

"I'm really okay. It's disappointing that I can't make friends, but if they dislike me, there's nothing I can do about it."

"Ostracizing a student is wrong."

"You can't force emotions. Of course it was difficult at first, but I'm okay now. If the children in Class Seven dislike me, there's nothing I can do. But that doesn't mean I'm hated by everyone in the world."

Siena could understand. For some people, the group they belonged to was their entire world, but for those who looked upward, such groups were merely temporary stops along the way.

"I want to meet more people. I'm sure there are people who can listen to my story more seriously."

Shirone was making his attitude toward early promotion clear. In her opinion too, if it was Class Five or above, there would be friends who could accept Shirone without an inferiority complex.

"Shirone, I've clearly heard your resolve. I'll reference it at the faculty meeting."

**Teleportation (1)**

"With that, I conclude my presentation regarding Shirone's early promotion."

With Principal Alpheas and the advanced class teachers in attendance, Siena submitted documents related to Class Seven's group ostracism incident and took her seat.

The teachers who reviewed the contents frowned. The circumstances of persistently ostracizing Shirone under the pretext that he couldn't cast magic were being revealed in detail.

"Does this make sense? Tormenting a class student for such a trivial reason?"

"It's entirely possible in the lower classes. There are many young children, and some students who stay despite having thick heads but no talent. The class itself lacks discrimination ability."

"Then it would be good to promote Shirone quickly. That child should be able to graduate within four years at minimum. With neighboring schools challenging Alpheas Magic School right now, the more early graduates the better."

The age of graduates was also one of the data points proving a school's excellence. While credibility would drop if they couldn't perform well in society, there were still rumors that other schools were competitively producing early graduates.

This was a standard method used to elevate a school to prestigious ranks. Once they obtained a prestigious title, outstanding talents would flock to them, and only then could they improve the quality of education.

In a situation where interference from other schools was severe, the method Alpheas Magic School could present was not only early promotion but also producing qualitatively excellent students. In that sense, the teachers had high expectations for Shirone.

"I'm somewhat negative about this."

Thad raised his hand and cast an opposing vote. Siena's expression soured. With early promotion becoming a foregone conclusion, he was throwing a wrench in the works, which was infuriating. However, Alpheas showed interest in this first dissenting opinion.

"Negative. Why is that?"

"I know Shirone has talent. However, the core of this incident is that Shirone cannot use magic. The children's backlash also stems from that point. Shouldn't we clearly address that issue before moving forward?"

Siena said, "I've already explained this. Shirone is learning the overall aspects of knowledge and isn't in a situation to focus on one particular field of study. Also, I personally am convinced that this is the method optimized for Shirone's growth."

"I'm not questioning the method. The problem is that Teacher Siena is showing too much favoritism toward Shirone."

"What did you say?"

"In any case, the children in Class Seven are also studying hard after entering the school. Whether Shirone had time to acquire knowledge or not, that should also be included as part of the evaluation criteria. Otherwise, there would be no reason not to promote other students early as well, right? Even if their Spirit Zones are weaker than Shirone's, they have theoretical superiority."

"Don't spout sophistry! I didn't judge this matter emotionally. This was entirely a conclusion reached according to school regulations. The main evaluation criterion for lower classes is clearly the Spirit Zone."

"The problem is the students' backlash. This incident could dampen their motivation. A teacher's job isn't to pour everything into one genius, is it?"

"Neglecting a talented student because of students' misguided jealousy isn't a teacher's job either!"

Both of them struck the table simultaneously and stood up. This was a regular spectacle whenever there was a meeting.
