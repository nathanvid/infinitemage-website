The relentless debate made the older teachers furrow their brows. Yet they remained silent because the arguing parties held higher ranks.

Siena and Thad, both certified 6th-grade mages active in their mid-twenties, along with Ethella, were the pride of Alpheas Magic School.

The argument showed no signs of subsiding. Ethella tried to mediate, but it was like fire and ice clashing head-onâ€”neither side would yield.

Alpheas simply smiled. Without passion for education, they wouldn't fight like this. They just had different objects for their passion.

Thad wanted the school's advancement, while Siena wanted the students' growth. As educators, they should naturally side with Siena, but Alpheas could also understand Thad's feelings as an alumnus.

"I've heard both of your opinions clearly. I understand what you're saying, so please stop now and take your seats."

The moment Alpheas spoke, Siena and Thad ceased their argument as if by magic. Their only common ground was their respect for Alpheas.

"From what I hear, both opinions have merit. Teacher Siena's words are logically sound. But we are, after all, educators. Shouldn't we also avoid letting prejudice take root in the children's hearts?"

"That's exactly my point, Headmaster."

Thad smiled while Siena remained expressionless. But Alpheas had no intention of ending it there. After pondering something thoughtfully, he smiled and offered his opinion.

"So then... how about we try this approach?"

A single official document was posted on the bulletin board of the advanced class building.

Dozens of students gathered in front of the bulletin board were shocked by its contents.

An unprecedented situation in the history of Alpheas Magic School. The document announced that all Class Seven students would undergo advancement evaluation.

The main points of the document were as follows:

All Class Seven students would be given the opportunity for early advancement. One student would be selected for advancement, and upon passing the test, would move up to Class Five. Acknowledging the students' concerns, the evaluation would exceptionally be conducted through magic rather than Spirit Zone.

The evaluation subject was teleportation.

"T-teleportation? I don't know how to do that. Do you?"

"No, of course not. It's a Class Five designated magic."

"I tried it once. But it was so scary I couldn't bring myself to try again."

"Idiot! If you just follow the formula, it's easy. The problem is that applications are difficult."

The murmuring voices of the children suddenly quieted. Shirone was walking over. Receiving concentrated fire from countless gazes, he arrived at the bulletin board and read through the document. The conclusion from the teachers' meeting was a real showdown between students.

'Teleportation.'

Shirone etched it clearly into his mind.

The incident dubbed the "Class Seven ostracism case" was also interesting to the advanced class students. Especially the fact that the target was Shirone sparked much discussion.

"My goodness! Such a thing happened? Amy, did you know?"

Amy, who only checked the bulletin board after the day's classes ended, read through the document in dismay. When Seriel told her the specific circumstances gathered from various rumors, her fists trembled with anger.

'He was ostracized? And because of me?'

Classmates reportedly wouldn't even make eye contact with Shirone. Moreover, when he exchanged greetings with Amy during integrated classes, some kids would openly curse at him.

"What do you think? Well, Class Seven does have young children. Actually, I went through something similar once. But I advanced quickly so it wasn't a big deal."

"Being young can't be an excuse. If we think that way, aren't we young too?"

"Anyway, we're in Class Four. Since magic involves a lot of mental aspects, I don't think age matters."

Amy didn't want to argue about this and that. Her mind was actually in chaos, so she couldn't think of anything. She was just angry that Shirone had suffered.

"Idiot! Why didn't you tell me?"

If he had honestly confided and consulted with her, they might have found a better solution. No, surely they would have. Regardless of popularity, she was first in Class Four. Thinking that nobodies had glared at him for dating such a person made her as angry as if it had happened to her.

"I need to go see Shirone."

"Going is fine, but what are you planning to do?"

"First, I'll give him a beating. Then I'll gather all the Class Seven kids. Since we're lovers, I can do that much, right?"

"What? Are you crazy? Absolutely not!"

"What do you mean absolutely not? Then should I just stay put? And it became like this because of me?"

"Ugh, you really don't understand men. Do you know why Shirone didn't tell you? Because his pride was hurt. If you add fuel to that fire, what will happen?"

Amy couldn't understand. The reason he hadn't even made eye contact all this time was just because he was afraid of Class Seven children.

This incident had hurt Amy's pride instead.

"Men, you see, like to be acknowledged. They live and die by their pride. Would he want to tell a girl he likes that he was ostracized?"

Seriel's words made sense, but that was only if they were truly in love. What should she make of him not telling her when it was just fake dating?

'He must think he stepped in shit because of me. That's why he's avoiding me.'

Seriel viewed the school's response positively.

"But isn't it fortunate? If he passes the advancement test, he can enter Class Five. The teleportation test was really well chosen. The Class Seven kids will have to learn from scratch too."

Amy thought differently. There was a difference between not learning a specific magic and not learning magic itself.

Moreover, teleportation of all things.

The most important thing when learning teleportation was overcoming fear. It was at a completely different speed from flight magic, and if you accidentally hit an obstacle, you could lose your life.

"Now that I think about it, this is an incredibly dangerous test, isn't it? What are the teachers thinking?"

"They'll probably adjust the difficulty appropriately. They might be testing the students' passion. I heard more than half of Class Seven plans to take the test."

"What? That many when they've never learned it?"

"The reward for passing is Class Five. Plus everyone's learning from scratch. I would have challenged it too."

Amy couldn't shake off her unease. The students taking the test would surely receive help from upperclassmen or have dedicated teachers for intensive practice.

On the other hand, Shirone wasn't in that situation. A dedicated teacher was unimaginable, and he didn't even have friends to ask for advice.

'He might really fail at this rate.'

While she acknowledged Shirone's talent, looking at just the short-term process, it was a test that couldn't guarantee success by any means.

"Right! Amy, how about you help Shirone? You could reconcile through this opportunity."

"Hmph! After going through such humiliation without a word of consultation, would he accept help? I'll just keep pretending I don't know."

"Ugh, you two are really something. If you like each other, that's all that matters. Why is that stuff important?"

"Mind your own business. That's our way of dating. Besides, I'm not in a leisurely situation either. The graduation class advancement test is right around the corner."

"Ah, right! That's true. Sorry."

Nothing was more important to students than advancement. Even Amy, to overcome the high barrier of graduation class, had no energy to spare for other things.

"He'll figure it out somehow. If he can't even do that much, it'd be better if he didn't have the title of being my boyfriend."

Amy, turning away from the bulletin board, continued internally.

'Even if he's a fake boyfriend.'

Near midnight.

A masked figure infiltrated the garden of the men's dormitory. With cat-like movements, even the grass made no sound as they stepped. Confirming that lights were on in the 7th floor of the building, they scratched their head in annoyance.

'This is absolutely not because I'm worried about him. I'm helping because I have some responsibility too!'

Amy ground her teeth. Even though she tried to let it go, she couldn't concentrate on her studies because she was concerned about Shirone.

"Just wait and see. I'll make you beg for forgiveness."

Amy climbed the wall to the 7th floor. If rumors spread that she had crossed the threshold of the men's dormitory in the middle of the night, she wouldn't be able to hold her head up, but her youthful mischief hadn't gone anywhere.

'Hehe, since it's come to this, I'll scare you so much your heart falls out.'

Amy rolled forward as soon as she opened the window. Calculations were made simultaneously with landing. She would subdue Shirone and throw him on the bed. Then she planned to twist his arm until he screamed.

"Huh?"

But Amy couldn't move a single step. Shirone was looking at her with surprised eyes. And beside him, Teacher Siena was sitting in a chair.

"T-Teacher?"

"Are you Amy?"

Siena adjusted her glasses and looked again. Just from the red hair and deep double eyelids, it was definitely Amy.

She knew Amy was dating Shirone, but recently thought they were only studying for their respective goals. But now that she looked, their behavior was suspicious beyond measure.

"Don't tell me you've been meeting like this all along? Acting like strangers during the day and enjoying secret meetings at night?"

"It's a misunderstanding, Teacher! That's a really huge misunderstanding!"

Siena quickly brought her hand to her mouth.

"Shh! The next room will hear."

Amy covered her mouth and glanced at the next room. This was the men's dormitory of all places. If rumors spread that a girl's voice was heard from Shirone's room, she would definitely be the first suspect. Though even so, she had nothing to say in this situation.

"Wait, hold on! I can understand me being here, but Teacher, what brings you here? And at this hour?"

Thinking about it, Siena was the most out-of-place person in the current situation. There was no reason for a teacher to visit in casual clothes late at night when they could simply summon him.

"Tell me. Why did you come here at this hour?"

At Amy's reasonable suspicion, Siena's cheeks flushed. But she quickly returned to her usual composure and spoke coldly.

"I came to give some advice about the advancement test. Given the circumstances, it seemed best to avoid being seen by others."

If the advancement test was the reason, Amy had nothing to counter with. She had come for the same reason.

"Um, senior."

Shirone, who had prepared tea, offered Amy a teacup.

"First, have some tea..."

"Hmm."

Amy took the teacup and savored the aroma. Like a well-mannered junior, he had the basic etiquette for welcoming guests.

"...my ass! This all happened because of you!"

"I'm sorry!"

When Shirone apologized, Amy became even more heated. Because he was so good-natured, even the young kids were ignoring him.

"Let's sit first. I'd like to finish the conversation we were having."

Siena offered seats. Amy sat next to Shirone and turned her body away. While she had come because she was concerned, she was still angry at Shirone.

"As you both know, the evaluation subject for this test is teleportation. It's a decision made directly by the Headmaster."

"The Headmaster?"

Amy finally understood the situation. She had thought it was a test inappropriate for Class Seven, but if it was the Headmaster's mischief, it made perfect sense.

"Right. Actually, I don't really understand his intention either. Teleportation is dangerous magic for lower classes to attempt."

Amy asked.

"The test will probably be at the 'Uncrossable Bridge,' right?"

"It's not certain, but honestly, there's nowhere else."
