The Impassable Bridge was a bridge connecting two mountain peaks at an altitude of 1,000 meters above sea level, the highest among all training grounds. The bridge stretched 700 meters in length, with rapids flowing through the valley below.

"Why is it called the Impassable Bridge?"

Amy explained in response to Shirone's question.

"Because it literally cannot be crossed. It's a training ground used for teleportation practice. The difficulty ranges from levels 1 to 10, and even I, being Class Four, would have to risk my life from level 8 onwards."

Siena added to the explanation.

"The advancement exam will be set to level 1. That means no obstacles. For Class Seven students, even leaping 700 meters would be impossible."

Amy asked, "Huh? Then how do they evaluate it? Isn't it about who arrives first for advancement?"

"The student who leaps the farthest distance will be selected. It shouldn't be too dangerous. They'll conduct it with safety measures activated, and advanced class teachers will be observing. The problem is the students themselves. When competition gets too intense, collisions between them are quite common."

Amy thought that was indeed the key issue. Since it was a test for early advancement, there would be no collusion. Even so, the person who would face the most interference would be Shirone.

"How about this approach? Shirone charges forward from the beginning. Of course, it would consume quite a bit of mental energy, but someone of Shirone's caliber should be able to handle it."

"I was thinking the same thing. That's why I'll be personally tutoring Shirone starting today."

"What? You, teacher?"

Amy's eyes widened in bewilderment. Having a teacher personally tutor a specific student would not only violate fairness but could easily lead to strange misunderstandings.

"Why would you go that far, teacher?"

"I bear some responsibility for this situation. I intended to register Shirone in Class Five from the beginning. But it fell through due to opposition from other teachers. If they had followed my advice, Shirone wouldn't have suffered bullying."

"But if rumors spread, it could become a bigger problem. Other students will research teleportation by any means necessary, but if word gets out that a teacher personally tutored Shirone, even a successful test could become meaningless. Instead of that, I'll take charge of Shirone for now. I can teach him easily enough for level 1 difficulty."

Siena shook her head.

"I understand you've applied for graduation class advancement. Wouldn't it be better to focus on that? You won't have time to spare worrying about Shirone."

"Oh? Really, senior?"

Shirone asked in disbelief. Being the first to apply when no one else had submitted their application yet meant she intended to break through using orthodox methods.

'I see. That's truly amazing.'

He was grateful that she had come to see him despite being busy preparing for the advancement exam. However, the situation was flowing differently from the warm atmosphere he had expected. The two women, their pride ignited, wouldn't yield even a single step.

"No matter how busy I am, I can at least help with teleportation, so why don't you give up, teacher? Rather, such interference could have a negative impact on Shirone."

"As a teacher, I cannot turn a blind eye knowing this is an important time for a student. The graduation class test can only be attempted once a year. Wouldn't it be better to leave it to the teacher and focus on graduation class matters?"

Both were wearing smiles, but looking at their eyes, they were definitely not laughing. Finally realizing they couldn't find a compromise, they turned to Shirone one last time.

"Shirone, you choose. Me or the teacher? Of course, having your girlfriend teach you would be better."

"That's right, Shirone. It would be best if you decide. A teacher can teach you much better than a student facing graduation exams."

Though their voices were gentle, from the recipient's perspective, it was a threat. However, Shirone remained unswayed by either and expressed what he had been thinking from the beginning.

"I'll just do it alone. Thank you for the offer, but I don't need help."

The women's expressions went blank.

"Learning from a teacher would violate fairness. And I don't want to receive help from a senior who has an exam ahead. I'll try to pass this test on my own."

"You fool! The other kids will get private tutoring for the exam! Plus, everyone's keeping you in check! This isn't something you can handle alone!"

"If that's the case, I can accept that outcome."

"Huh?"

"I think senior's decision to pursue graduation class advancement is truly amazing. It's a resolve that if you can't overcome even this much, you won't be able to surpass any future obstacles."

"Huh? That's... well, that's true, but..."

"It's the same for me. I'll work hard and definitely pass. I won't be a boyfriend to be ashamed of."

Realizing how great Shirone's determination was, Amy could no longer object. Above all, she was grateful that he acknowledged her decision.

"Hmph. Of course you should."

Though no one was chosen by Shirone, the atmosphere suggested Amy had won by decision.

Siena adjusted her glasses and stood up.

"If that's the student's thinking, then the teacher must accept it. But if you ever have questions, come and ask anytime. That goes for other students too."

"Yes. Thank you for your concern."

Before opening the door to leave, Siena spoke to Amy.

"I'll let it slide today since there's no choice, but refrain from entering male students' rooms in the future. You could face disciplinary action if caught next time."

Amy bowed her head humbly. In her mind, she could only consider today lucky.

After Siena left, an awkward silence settled in.

Shirone, experiencing being alone in a room with a girl his age for the first time, couldn't utter a single word.

Then Amy was also swept up in the strange atmosphere. She had come here with the intention of giving him a good punch, but now that she was in this situation, Shirone began to seem frightening.

"Then... I'll go too."

"Ah, yes! Thank you for worrying about me."

Amy let out a sigh of relief and prepared to leave. Then, as if suddenly remembering something, she turned to Shirone and shouted.

"You fool! Why didn't you tell me? If something like that happened, you should have consulted me right away."

"I'm sorry. But I didn't want to talk about it."

"Because of pride? Stupid, what's so important about that?"

"It's more that... I didn't want to break up with you, senior."

Amy's cheeks flushed hot.

"Even if I told the truth, it would only make things more awkward between us. But I want to continue having a good relationship with you in the future. You're my goal, senior."

Shirone recalled the first day he entered magic school. From the moment he saw the name Carmis Amy at the top of Class Four, his goal had always been Amy.

"I'll definitely catch up to you, senior. So please work hard too."

Amy felt pleased but also somewhat burdened. The truth was, she was feeling similar emotions.

"Then don't call me senior anymore."

"Huh?"

"We're the same age anyway, and I acknowledge you too, so don't call me senior anymore."

"But that's..."

"I'm annoyed! What's with that? Acting like you're following by calling me 'senior' while chasing from behind is cowardly! Come to my side and compete fairly!"

Class standing in magic school was connected to social status. For her to tell him not to treat her as a senior meant she considered Shirone her equal.

"Instead, hurry up and climb up. If you just talk big but stay pathetically below, I'll cast you aside. Got it?"

Amy walked to the window with a reddened face. Unable to leave through the door, she had to climb over the wall again.

"Amy."

When Shirone called her name, Amy flinched and looked back. If he did it immediately after being told, what would happen to the listener?

But Shirone's eyes were burning terrifyingly. Facing that gaze, her frivolous emotions vanished instantly.

"I'll definitely catch up. Wait for me in the graduation class."

Amy's eyes curved like a seagull's. Though hidden by her mask and not visible, she was surely smiling.

"Hmph. By then, I'll probably have already graduated. If you can follow, try following all you want."

Amy jumped down from the window. When he looked down below the window, she had already disappeared.

Shirone let out a sigh. Though he had acted strong, the truth was he felt at a loss about where to start.

"Teleportation, huh..."

* * *

One month remained until the advancement exam. He had to master teleportation somehow within that time. First, he went to the Great Library and gathered all the books about teleportation magic. Contrary to his expectation that there would be no stock, obtaining books wasn't difficult.

According to rumors, roughly 20 students would participate in the advancement exam. This meant that all of them were studying through special methods rather than relying on books.

"At this rate, I might really fail."

Shirone calmed his anxious heart and steadily learned teleportation from the basic concepts.

The photonization theory, considered one of the greatest discoveries in magical history, was magic that transformed a mage's body into light.

Then what mattered were the properties of light, which were too complex for the human mind to understand.

It possessed both particle and wave properties simultaneously, had no relative velocity, and didn't even contain mass.

However, Kergos gained great insight from those complex properties. By utilizing the absolute nature of light, which has no relative velocity, one could rapidly leap through space.

Anyone could succeed at teleportation if they adopted photonization theory as their foundation. That's what made it a great discovery, but the problem was how much control one could exercise over it.

Teleportation moved to the destination so quickly that trying to calculate and move with one's head would likely result in death.

'Right. It's impossible to calculate speeds reaching 10 to the 20th power.'

Shirone continued reading the book. Mages divided light speed into four major categories: faster-than-light, light speed, sub-light speed, and quasi-sub-light speed.

Faster-than-light was speed exceeding light itself, a realm where time slip magic that theoretically reversed time was possible. However, it remained an unknown territory that no mage had yet reached.

Therefore, the most outstanding light mages among humans were those who wielded light speed. They could learn Stop magic, called the realm of gods, but mages who reached this level could be counted on fingers throughout history.

Ultimately, most professional mages dealing with light had their skills differentiated within the realm of sub-light speed.

According to mages' definition, sub-light speed was "speed that far exceeded the maximum velocity of matter but was much slower than light speed."

Sub-light speed was also the basic omnipotence of spatial movement. Light speed realm would require no time for movement, but even handling just sub-light speed made it possible to reach destinations within seconds.

Shirone read with continuous amazement, but it still didn't feel realistic. What he needed to focus on was the final speed of light: quasi-sub-light speed.

The definition of quasi-sub-light speed established by mages was "speed that exceeded the maximum velocity of living beings but was much slower than sub-light speed."

That's why, even though teleportation possessed light properties, human eyes could track the movement path.

Since it wasn't speed enough to distort space, overlooking even one obstacle in the surrounding environment could lead to irreversible disaster.

'The moment I miss even one piece of cover, it's over. Even if photonization theory reduces mass, there's still speed, so it would be a fatal impact.'

He understood why Siena had emphasized that the Impassable Bridge had no obstacles. However, she had said there were no special measures for collisions between students.

'Can I really do it? With just basic formulas?'
