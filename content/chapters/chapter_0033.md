title: Chapter 33 - Teleportation (4)

The time it takes to travel from point A to point B is within one second. Calculating variables in your head during that time is extremely difficult. Moreover, due to the nature of teleportation requiring multiple short-range repetitions, the confusion would only grow with each attempt.

"Ah, I see."

Shirone slapped his palm down. He couldn't calculate it with his mind, but he could sense it through intuition.

Just as he could count the number of leaves on a tree through his Spirit Zone, he could perceive the speed of light through insight as well.

This was exactly what Alpheas wanted. Magic that anyone could learn, but whose mastery level would vary dramatically based on talent.

Shirone gained confidence. Though he might lag behind in omniscience, he had been honing his omnipotence daily since he was twelve years old.

There were thirty days left until the exam.

Shirone did his best to transform Kergos's photonization theory into omniscience. After classes ended, he buried himself in books all night at the dormitory. After twenty days passed, there was nothing more to study by reading books alone.

From that day on, he sought out the training ground exclusive to Class Seven. His classmates all seemed to be doing private training, as the place was quietly empty.

Shirone combined the omniscience of photonization theory with the omnipotence of his Spirit Zone. Since it was his first attempt, finding the right sensation was difficult.

Shirone stood between omniscience and omnipotence. The moment he erased himself from that state, omniscience and omnipotence would stick together, triggering the magic.

Shirone cast the magic in a state of selflessness. He felt his body decomposing as light flashed brilliantly. The moment he tilted his head forward to advance, the melting world came crashing down on him.

"Aaahhh!"

Having moved a distance of five meters, Shirone rolled on the ground the instant he arrived. It felt like every bone in his body was shattering.

"Ughhhh..."

Even while gritting his teeth and enduring the pain, the word "failure" was etched into his mind. If he didn't perfectly reduce his mass through photonization, the impact force from advancing at near-light speed would hit him directly.

It was magic too dangerous to attempt alone.

However, Shirone, who had neither a private tutor nor even upperclassmen to ask for advice, had no choice but to learn through physical trial and error.

'I won't give up. I'll definitely succeed.'

From that day on, Shirone corrected his mistakes through countless trials and errors. It seemed like a crude method, but ultimately, only the memories learned through the body would remain.

After a few days, an unidentifiable person appeared at the training ground to observe Shirone. It was probably a spy sent by someone, but he didn't care. There was nowhere else suitable anyway.

How many times had he rolled on the ground and pressed his lips to the dirt? His entire body was bruised, and his joints ached every morning when he woke up.

And so the final day approached.

With ten minutes left until midnight, Shirone staggered back to his position.

"I absolutely... won't give up..."

His throat was rough from inhaling dust. With half-glazed eyes, he stood blankly in the center of the training ground.

Most of the errors had been corrected. What remained was the persistence to overcome pain and the will to conquer fear.

Shirone couldn't move. He was too afraid to cast teleportation. His stamina had dropped to its lowest point, and now even his bones seemed bruised, aching at the slightest touch.

"I have to... I must do it..."

Shirone muttered in a dazed state. Perhaps this was for the best. He could forget himself naturally without any effort.

"Teleportation..."

At the extreme differential point where his upper body leaned, Shirone's body shot forward ten meters. Though it couldn't compare to the speed of light, to human eyes it looked like a flash had passed.

Arriving at his destination, Shirone hastily caught his upper body as it was about to fall forward.

"..."

He stood there for a long while. He couldn't feel it. This time, the terrible pain didn't come.

"Hehe, I did it."

The bell announcing midnight rang out.

Listening to that solemn sound, Shirone collapsed to the ground while still standing upright. The smell of earth stimulated his nostrils.

In thirty days, the distance he had advanced through teleportation was merely ten meters. But it was his first leap of ten meters.

'How far can I go with this?'

To pass through the 700 meters of the unbridgeable bridge, he would need to cast teleportation at least seventy times. Moreover, if it was a race, he had to consider stamina as well.

Casting teleportation once was far more inefficient than casting an attack spell once.

If you were going to cast teleportation to move ten meters, it would be better to just run quickly instead.

In the end, the key was continuity.

If he couldn't cast continuously without rest, teleportation would be worse than useless magic.

If he arrived at his destination in a perfectly photonized state, inertia would disappear. Thanks to this, the mage's body wouldn't be destroyed, but to chain teleportations, he needed the same level of concentration as the first attempt.

'I don't have time for this. I can't just lie here. I need to practice more. At least I need to strengthen the chaining part more...'

His motivation remained the same, but he couldn't move a single finger. His consciousness was being sucked into the abyss, and Shirone's eyelids slowly closed.

And so the next morning dawned.

* * *

Mark opened the window and felt the refreshing morning breeze. He stretched lazily and went to the bathroom to wash his face. A smile never left his face as he changed clothes.

Today would be a historic day in his life.

'Fast promotion from Class Seven. Hehe. I'm already looking forward to seeing how the Class Six kids will treat me.'

Mark had a sturdy build that was hard to believe for a fifteen-year-old. Though physical strength wasn't particularly important in the magical world, young children were naturally intimidated by visible size. On top of that, he was born with magical talent, so no one in Class Seven dared to challenge him. Thanks to pressuring Shirone and gaining this opportunity, his pride had grown even stronger.

"Young master, how are you feeling?"

A man with a slender build opened the door and greeted him. He was the mage who had privately tutored Mark in teleportation for a month. Though hastily hired due to the urgent nature of the situation, he was still a certified 9th-grade mage and skilled in imitation.

"I'm fine. How about Shirone?"

"Same as always. No matter how easy teleportation is to learn, there are limits to doing it alone. Even if he takes the promotion exam, he won't be a match for you, young master."

"Hmm. Still, I shouldn't be careless. His Spirit Zone is larger than mine."

Mark was satisfied with what he had just said. Wasn't it often said that the weakness of geniuses was laziness? But he was different. With natural talent combined with effort, there was no way he could lose to Shirone.

"By the way, how many are participating in the operation?"

"From what I heard yesterday, four."

"That's quite few. The opportunity to receive private tutoring from a certified mage isn't common."

"They must be getting greedy without knowing their place. Or perhaps it's petty pride."

Mark snorted as he thought of the students who had refused to participate in the operation. Those with no talent whatsoever had been blinded by the opportunity for early promotion and kicked away their fortune with their own feet.

'Let them do as they please. Anyway, the promotion belongs to me, Slider Mark.'

The Slider family was nobility of the third rank, not a very high grade, but since most family members worked at the Magic Association, they had considerable influence in magical society.

The snooty first-rank noble children might sneer, but anyway, such kids wouldn't stay long in places like Class Seven if they weren't confident in their magic, as they wouldn't even enroll in the first place.

In any competition, if there were upper ranks, there were also lower ranks. Mark decided to pull in children with mediocre grades to form his operation team. When he offered to help them get jobs at the association after graduation, several came over. They judged it more realistic to make a deal than try to pass through the needle's eye of one successful candidate.

"Four is enough. We just need to crush him at the beginning."

"How about teleportation?"

Mark opened the door and gave a thumbs up as he left.

"Perfect. I could cross 700 meters with my eyes closed."

"I wish you victory, young master."

The certified 9th-grade mage showed courtesy to Mark until the last day. From his perspective, Mark was a junior far below him, but since he was hired by Mark's father, who was a technical advisor at the Magic Association, Mark was also his employer's son.

Mark headed toward the advanced class building. Since the promotion exam was scheduled for today, there were no regular classes, but students not participating in the test remained for self-study. Mark also came here first to meet with his operation team.

As expected, the expressions of the self-studying children weren't good. It was due to the self-loathing of not even qualifying to take the exam.

Mark enjoyed his sense of superiority as he looked over their faces. Thinking that those who remained in the classroom today would probably be in a position to shine his shoes when they entered society, he couldn't help but laugh.

"Hey, Maria! Are you giving up on the exam too?"

Mark raised his hand toward Maria approaching from a distance. Maria's face turned pale. After reporting Shirone's bullying incident to Siena, she had also become a target of bullying.

Mark looked at the helpless Maria with disgust.

'Tch. Bat-like girl. Acting all cooperative when we were bullying together, but now slipping away by herself? Just older but completely useless. Why does someone like that even come to school?'

The frightened Maria spoke first.

"Mark, didn't you go to the practice ground? Are you here to self-study too?"

"Haha! As if that would happen! I'm not like you. I came because I had time and wanted to meet some friends."

Maria felt depressed being spoken down to by Mark, who was four years younger. But since her skills were poor, she couldn't blame anyone.

"What are you doing in a place like this anyway? What's going to change by studying for one day? That's why your grades don't improve. Come up to the practice ground and observe. Watching skilled people and learning from them is also studying."

"Yeah, right..."

Even while listening to Mark's lecture, Maria maintained an awkward smile. She just wanted to quickly end the conversation and leave.

"Well, good luck. I hope you really pass."

"Heh! Do you really think so?"

At Mark's sneer, Maria's heart sank with a thud.

"I've been patient because we were classmates until now. But if I become an upperclassman, you'd better be prepared then. I won't forget about you tattling to the teacher."

Maria tried to make excuses in her urgency, but her mind went blank and no words came to her. Finally giving up, she bowed her head and hurried away with quick steps.

Mark snorted and entered the classroom where his operation team had gathered. Four classmates were waiting in the empty lecture hall.

Three boys and one girl. They were students who had been training for a month to interfere with Shirone. They had especially focused on practicing situations occurring within 100 meters.

Shirone would surely know he was being targeted, so he would try to break through at the beginning. The key was to eliminate him before that happened.

Intentional collisions might result in disciplinary action, so they had to be careful, but from Mark's perspective, it actually didn't matter if they crashed into him head-on. He could just compensate them for their sacrifice.

"How is it? You've properly planned the strategy, right?"

"Yeah. Right after we start, two people will stick to Shirone first. Meanwhile, the other two will escort you. If Shirone breaks through from there, we'll have to use the last resort."

They had at most two chances to bring down Shirone. But for a battle decided within 100 meters, it was a satisfactory number of opportunities.

Shirone's jump distance was probably the standard ten meters. Then the operation team just needed to make Shirone fall within the first ten attempts.

"I won't forget today's help. When I get early promotion, I'll lead you all."

"Right. We're counting only on you."

Mark was satisfied. Everything was going according to plan. He would be the protagonist of the proud two-class early promotion.

"Good! Shall we head out?"
