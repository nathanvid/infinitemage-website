## Teleportation Practice Ground

Students arrived one after another at the peak 1,000 meters above sea level. Since there were no classes, not only Class Seven students but also upper-class students gathered to witness the results.

After today, one student from Class Seven would advance to Class Five.

Considering that it normally takes an average of two years to advance one class, in the worst case, a student four or more years younger could become a classmate.

"Wow! So this is the Unbridgeable Bridge. I've never been here before."

The students participating in the advancement exam were amazed by the enormous scale of the practice ground. Teachers and students had also gathered on the opposite peak 700 meters away.

"But why is it called the Unbridgeable Bridge? Where's the bridge?"

"Idiot, it's right there."

A long iron bar connected the two peaks. The longer the length, the weaker the tension. The fact that a 700-meter bar stretched across proved it was made of alchemical material.

Several students walked to the cliff edge and looked down. Contrary to what the teachers had said, there was no safety equipment visible, not even anything resembling it.

"What's this? Won't we die if we fall?"

Thad, who had jumped between peaks using spatial movement, spoke.

"No need to worry. The safety measures are reliable."

The students couldn't feel at ease. They had heard that students had actually died during teleportation practice at other schools.

"How does it work exactly?"

"If you fall 100 meters, an Air Net spell automatically activates. The safety measures are designed to be invisible because students don't feel tension if they can see them."

"What if it malfunctions?"

"Ha ha ha! I can't say that will never happen. But nothing like that has occurred so far."

"So there's no absolute guarantee of safety?"

"Hmm, you could say that."

The students' faces turned pale. Thad turned around with a satisfied expression. Even if the safety measures malfunctioned, no accidents would occur. That's why they had suspended all advanced classes and summoned the teachers.

But even if an accident happened, it couldn't be helped. Magic schools were special-purpose institutions supported by the kingdom, so injuries or deaths during classes were not considered negligence in principle. Students already knew this when they applied to advanced classes.

"It's been ages since I've been here. Amy, let's go over there."

Seriel grabbed Amy's hand and pulled her up the hill. Amy looked reluctant but eventually followed her lead and spoke.

"I don't want to watch. Class Seven level is so predictable."

"Oh my! Your boyfriend is boldly advancing to Class Five, and what are you saying? If his girlfriend doesn't cheer him on at a time like this, when will you earn points?"

"Tch! Whether I cheer or not, those who'll pass will pass and those who'll fail will fail."

Amy acted tough, but inside she was quite concerned. How much had his teleportation level improved in a month? Could he even teleport at all?

Practical training was best for mastering the sensation of teleportation. But since the process was extremely painful, most people first learned techniques following an expert's advice before diving in.

Amy, on the other hand, was the type who literally learned by throwing herself into it. Of course, having mastered Schema from childhood, it wasn't too difficult for her.

'But Shirone wouldn't be like that. He's not the type to give up either. His condition better be okay.'

Even if not as much as Shirone, Class Seven had quite a few noteworthy talents. Depending on the situation, it wouldn't be strange if Shirone failed.

"Huh? But I don't think Shirone has arrived yet?"

When Seriel looked at the peak through binoculars, Amy hastily snatched the binoculars. As she said, Shirone wasn't visible among the twenty students standing on the cliff.

"What? What's going on?"

"Don't tell me he failed?"

They couldn't be certain. They believed in Shirone because it was him, but realistically, it wasn't easy magic to learn through self-study.

'This idiot... where the hell is he and what is he doing?'

* * *

Under the scorching sun, Shirone opened his eyes. Unlike usual, his view was low and the sky was high. When a jay hopped in front of him, he snapped to full alertness.

"Ahhh! What is this!"

Looking around, he was in the middle of the training ground. He had been sleeping since collapsing last night.

Having studied with only three hours of sleep daily and then pushing his body to the limit for the remaining week, it was no different from fainting.

'The advancement exam!'

Cold sweat trickled down Shirone's spine. Without time to feel despair, he kicked off the ground and ran. To climb 1,000 meters above sea level, regardless of condition, he had to run no matter what.

'Please! Please!'

## The Unbridgeable Bridge (1)

"We'll begin, Headmaster."

"Yes, proceed."

When Siena fired an illumination spell toward the sky, tension filled the practice ground. Ethella, who confirmed the illumination from the opposite peak, looked around at the students and spoke.

"When the teacher gives the signal, run toward the cliff. The person who travels the farthest using teleportation will pass the advancement test."

The students gulped nervously. The Unbridgeable Bridge's difficulty was Level 1 with no obstacles, but the terror of flying through empty air was beyond imagination.

Regardless of ranking, they needed to chain at least 70 teleportations to safely reach land. Moreover, if their rhythm broke midway, the fear of falling would make even their Spirit Zone disappear.

'I can't cross anyway. I'll eventually fall, but what if the safety measures don't work?'

Even when told it was safe, most students couldn't believe it—such is human psychology—and their bodies stiffened with tension. The only ones with any composure were Mark and his operation team.

'Hmph. I've practiced every day. As long as I'm not disturbed, seventy times should be enough.'

The variable was Shirone's absence. Mark's dedicated mage had reported that Shirone's progress was slow, but he couldn't believe it until seeing it with his own eyes. Now that it had come to this, he felt foolish for being nervous about someone insignificant.

'Teleportation. He couldn't master it. Well, he was never much to look at except for his Spirit Zone anyway.'

The person most anxious about Shirone's absence was Amy. Her tough demeanor had vanished, and she was pacing anxiously on the cliff.

"What the hell! What's going on! Why isn't he coming!"

"Amy, look over there!"

Seriel pointed to the opposite peak. When Amy checked through binoculars, Shirone was running up to the summit. His clothes were covered in dirt from wherever he'd been rolling around, and his face was blue as if he couldn't even breathe.

"Where was he doing what to come only now! That idiot!"

Seriel sighed in relief.

"Still, it's fortunate. He arrived on time. But he must be exhausted—will he be okay?"

"I don't know! What do I care! Just be grateful he didn't get disqualified!"

Anyway, seeing that he arrived at the exam site, it seemed he could teleport. Seeing his split lips and the dark bruises on his arms, Amy could picture Shirone's ordeal. She regained her composure and looked around.

"The wind is quite strong today. It'll be a difficult exam."

While not as much as the flight spell Fly, teleportation wasn't completely free from wind speed or air pressure either. It would be an exam where they couldn't lose concentration for even a moment.

The students waiting for the exam had grim expressions at Shirone's appearance. Just when they thought he'd given up and let their guard down, it felt like being hit from behind.

"Tch! That bastard did that on purpose. To confuse us."

"He acts innocent but he's quite cunning. Does he want to advance so badly he'd resort to such underhanded tactics?"

While it was true he had shocked the children mentally, Shirone was in a state of physical exhaustion, so he was actually at a disadvantage.

Ethella looked at the panting Shirone and fell into thought. Since he arrived before the exam started, there was no problem with his qualifications, but exams should evaluate ability under equal conditions.

'Would proceeding like this cause no problems with fairness?'

She shot an orange illumination spell into the sky. Blue meant ready, red meant test start, and orange meant question mark.

The teachers who confirmed Ethella's flare discussed their opinions. Views were split between starting immediately and giving even ten minutes of rest.

"What do you think, Headmaster?"

Alpheas was firm.

"Let's begin. Managing one's condition is also part of a student's capability before an exam. It's not our place to intervene."

"Understood. Then..."

Siena conveyed the decision to proceed with red illumination. Shirone squeezed between the students lined up in a row. The only people kindly making space for him were Mark's operation team.

All the students were equally tense. No matter how much special training they'd received, running across a 1,000-meter cliff was a different matter. An unknown world equal for everyone. What would they see, how would they feel, how frightening would it be when the sky spread beneath their feet—they wouldn't know until it happened.

"Now we'll begin Class Seven's early advancement test. Get ready."

The students took running positions. Just as only the sound of heartbeats began to be heard, Ethella cast her illumination spell.

With a bang, a red sphere shot into the sky. The teachers on the other side flipped through their documents, preparing to record, and the students kicked off the ground and ran without anyone taking the lead.

'First place! I need to take first place!'

'If I charge ahead in first, it's not completely impossible!'

Most students had similar thoughts. As a result, Shirone, whose legs had lost strength, inevitably fell behind.

But there was still a chance to recover. The point at which each person would cast teleportation before the cliff depended on their individual resolve. The best start was to kick off from the cliff edge and then cast teleportation while airborne.

But how many people could actually do that? It was the starting point with the highest tension, and the Unbridgeable Bridge was at an altitude of 1 kilometer above sea level.

Wind speed, wind direction, air pressure, temperature—every environmental factor differed from practice. If they leaped with their bare bodies and the magic failed, that would be the end. It was human nature to want to start from the ground where there was a chance for recovery.

As Shirone expected, when five meters remained to the cliff, students who couldn't bear the fear began casting teleportation and flying away first. Then the remaining students followed one after another. In the group maintaining the lead, Mark's party were the only ones who hadn't started yet.

'No! Just a little more!'

He suppressed his rising fear and kept running. Shirone would definitely be aiming for the optimal start. Then he too needed a starting point comparable to that.

'Can I do it? What if I fall?'

Even gritting his teeth and steeling his resolve couldn't erase the queasy feeling. When the operation team escorting Mark couldn't endure and shot away like lightning, he too finally cast teleportation.

Even with more than half the students having left the cliff, Shirone was still running. The operation team matching Shirone's pace felt their blood drain.

At this rate, they would fall off the cliff. With two steps remaining to the edge, the operation team finally cast their magic first. Even so, Shirone kept running. Having understood the essence of danger, fear posed no hindrance to him whatsoever.

The first turn hadn't even ended yet. If he could just get a good start, he could make up for falling behind on the ground.
