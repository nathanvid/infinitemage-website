Unlike the fierce psychological warfare taking place, to the distant spectators it merely looked like students jumping down in a rush. Such was the intensity of the battle unfolding in mere seconds.

*'Until you fall, you haven't fallen.'*

Even with the cliff just one step away, Shirone's body didn't glow. This made the watching students' hearts pound even harder. Kicking off from the edge of the precipice, Shirone leaped as far as possible. An incredible floating sensation. Strong winds shook his body as mountain birds flew in flocks far below his feet.

Shirone focused solely on teleportation. At the critical point of his leap, his body finally flashed and shot forward in a burst of light.

With Shirone as the last, everyone completed their first turn. Naturally, the rankings flipped when moving into the second turn. The group that had started first fell to the rear.

Shirone made up for the gap that had opened during the run. Most importantly, he was able to overtake Mark by a narrow margin.

Mark was shocked to see Shirone emerge from behind. How late must he have started to be able to overtake him in the first turn? Of course, the leading group was still within 10 meters of each other, so the rankings could easily change, but it was frustrating that his expected strategy had come to nothing.

"You bastard! Don't stop there!"

With a split-second time difference, Shirone and Mark cast teleportation magic almost simultaneously.

* * *

Ten minutes before the advancement exam began.

There was a girl walking toward the practice field with a gloomy expression.

Erlang Maria.

The third daughter of the Erlang family, nobility of the 3rd rank, she was a 19-year-old prodigy who had awakened to magical talent early and entered Alpheas Magic School.

Although she now remained in Class Seven and was mocked even by Mark, who was four years younger, she hadn't always failed to distinguish herself.

She had entered school at age 10 and fought fiercely for nine whole years. But at some point, such competition began to feel meaningless.

She couldn't understand why she had to desperately struggle to move up to higher classes. Even if she advanced, it would just be the start of new competition. The life she was living was just a marathon with no destination.

"Sigh, what am I doing right now?"

Perhaps it was because she had missed the timing to push forward. From the moment she realized she was the oldest in Class Seven, everything felt empty.

The probability of a Class Ten entrant rising to Class Seven was roughly 40 percent. Breaking through less than half the odds was something to be proud of.

Maria had also been elated when she entered Class Seven at age 15. But the happiness was brief, and she gradually felt fear at the narrowing gap for advancement.

Ironically, her best academic performance was in her first year after advancing to Class Seven.

But from the following year, her grades gradually declined, and now she had reached the level of being ignored even by new students.

She was afraid to compete. She had to risk her life for something. She had to become a little more tenacious and a little more perfect. Whenever she had such thoughts, she felt suffocated.

Was she unable to leave school due to inertia, or because some passion still remained? Or perhaps she was being stubborn because she felt sorry for the time she had invested?

Maria, who had entered magic school because she loved magic, sighed as she discovered herself losing her identity.

Advancement exams were nothing more than other people's business. But staying in the classroom with young children for self-study also hurt her pride.

With such thoughts, she walked aimlessly. Then, suddenly thinking she should go to the practice field, she turned her steps.

Perhaps those shining talents would be engaging in fierce competition at that peak? Seeing them would only deepen her self-loathing, but anyway, she felt the lifespan of her passion was running out.

Grasping at straws, or hoping some incident might occur to provide even a small stimulus, she moved her empty steps.

"Hm?"

Ethella's illumination spell shot up from the peak. Judging by the blue color, the exam preparations were in full swing.

The cheers of students echoed down. Maria, who had lost the confidence to head there, stopped walking. Their cheers weren't meant for her.

*'My place isn't up there. Only the outstanding ones from Class Seven would be there.'*

At that moment, some devil-like thought lodged in her mind and guided Maria's path.

At first, she had simply turned her steps because she didn't want to ignore the fact that a possibility existed.

Then, when she came to her senses, she had already arrived at the control room of the Unbridgeable Bridge.

Perhaps it wasn't over—that hope.

Clinging to that hope, she opened the door to the control room. A staff member sat in a chair, yawning. Normally, a teacher would accompany such advancement exams, but today the Unbridgeable Bridge's mechanisms were turned off and all teachers had mobilized for student safety, so none were visible.

The relaxed staff member stretched his legs and whistled. But shortly after, his eyelids slowly closed and his head drooped.

Behind the deeply sleeping staff member stood Maria.

Sleep magic that relaxed the mind had little effect on mages, but was quite effective on people who didn't know magic.

Maria looked around the control devices. The Air Net safety device was activated, and on the side was a rotary switch that adjusted the difficulty of the Unbridgeable Bridge.

She placed her finger on the safety device button. Her body trembled. Was this really the right thing to do? No, right or wrong aside, was this really something she could do at her level?

She just had to press the button. It would cause terrible consequences that the usual her could never imagine, but when people become obsessed with something, only sweet rewards fill their minds.

Maria pressed the button. Once she put it into action, it was laughably simple. No terrible events, no miserable consequences. She had simply pressed a button.

The lights of the Air Net installed on the cliff began to lose their red glow.

* * *

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosive sounds erupted from the crowd of students. Twenty people were each flickering as they raced through the 1,000-meter-high airspace.

At the point where the third turn was proceeding overall, the distance between the leaders and the rear wasn't greatly separated.

It was like a massive human constellation moving.

But differences in skill became apparent. Most of those who had started early couldn't endure the emptiness of having nothing beneath their feet and their minds wavered.

*'Huff, huff! Am I really falling? Here?'*

Looking down, it was a ten-thousand-foot precipice. Whether safety devices were really installed, or even if it was safe, having to inevitably fall 100 meters was a terrible thing.

As their Spirit Zones weakened, their leap distances decreased. The more this happened, the gap with the leading group widened instantly.

The Spirit Zone was an extremely sensitive mental state. Therefore, even the slightest loss of concentration made it impossible to maintain. Eventually, students in the rear group who failed to maintain teleportation began to plummet headfirst.

"Aaaahhh!"

"Sa-save me! Please save me!"

"Wahahahaha!"

The seniors watching from across burst into laughter. Having already experienced the Unbridgeable Bridge, they found their struggling juniors merely cute. The teachers also smiled as they carefully recorded the evaluations of the eliminated students on their papers.

But the festival-like atmosphere changed in an instant.

Without exception, the teachers raised their heads with surprised expressions. Though enough time had passed for students to be caught by the Air Net, no siren was sounding.

"What! What's happening! Control room!"

"I'll go check!"

Thad cast spatial teleportation. Light shot up into the sky and curved toward the control room.

"I'll save the students first!"

Siena dove below the cliff, casting teleportation at terrifying speed. Ethella, who had been watching from across, also realized something was wrong and jumped down.

"Principal, what should we do? Should we stop the exam?"

Alpheas exhaled with a "hmm." With two certified 6th-grade mages going, the students would be safe. However, whether to continue the exam as it was needed consideration.

From the school's standpoint, stopping the exam would be convenient. But then the students desperately maintaining the leading group would suffer uncompensated losses. As long as safety was guaranteed, it was better to respect the participants' will.

"Let's watch for now. Twenty or so students can be sufficiently protected. If we end it like this, wouldn't we be making light of the students' passion?"

Siena and Ethella simultaneously shot up from the precipice. Students caught in Air Net magic followed, ascending.

"What's going on? Something seems to have gone wrong."

Seriel said while surveying the air with binoculars. Other students also murmured at the unexpected situation.

But Amy wasn't swept up in the atmosphere. Falling deaths wouldn't occur in a place where certified 6th-grade teachers were standing guard. Moreover, the leading students remained undisturbed. She would have done the same. With Class Five at stake, what did safety matter?

On the other hand, noticeable disturbance arose in the middle group. Seeing teachers jump below the cliff to catch students made them sense something had gone wrong.

*'No safety device?'*

What had allowed them to endure the fear until now was that no matter how much it resembled real combat, it wasn't actually real. But now they were truly floating over a thousand-foot precipice.

"Aaaahhh! No way!"

"Teacher! Please save me! I'll give up the exam!"

"We're really going to die at this rate!"

The middle group began falling one after another. A spectacular scene unfolded as teachers flashed with light while rescuing students.

Even in such circumstances, the leading group's sprint didn't stop. They too knew something had gone wrong with the safety devices, but rather rejoiced.

*'This is our chance! Let as many as possible be eliminated.'*

Before entering magic school, these children had grown up being told they were unparalleled geniuses in the world. Their competitive spirit was on a different level from ordinary children their age. The distance the leading group had advanced so far was 270 meters. It was an incredible level for Class Seven.

Shirone still maintained first place. Though Mark and his strategy team alternately overtook him, he was invariably reversed in the next turn. During 27 consecutive teleportations, his leap distance per turn was exactly 10 meters without the slightest error.

*'I will only repeat each moment. Erase the concept of linking.'*

The mechanical routine Shirone had refined in preparation for this test was showing its brilliance. Under certain conditions, humans could become far more precise than machines—this was the unconscious action called repetitive compulsion. Humans who utilize compulsion are frightening. When they decide they must do something, they advance like machines, breaking through barriers.

*'Damn! He's really persistent! What are the others doing!'*

Mark was irritated. Because Shirone wouldn't give up the lead, there was no room for the strategy team to intervene. When he glanced to the side with sharp eyes, a female member of the strategy team who met his gaze flinched. It was silent pressure to begin the final measure.

The method was mutual destruction.

But the safety devices were turned off. She wondered if this was really the right thing to do.

*'No. I have to do it. Whether I die like this or live a failed life, it's all the same.'*

She raised her concentration to maximum. By giving up completing the course and casting teleportation, she could briefly take the lead.

The girl who rapidly linked teleportation blocked Shirone's path. Simultaneously, another strategy team member blocked Shirone's left route.

With front and side blocked, as the girl slowed down, Shirone had no choice but to reduce his leap distance.
