'Sorry. We need to survive too.'

The male student squeezed his eyes shut and cast Teleportation toward Shirone.

If a collision occurred, fatal injuries would be unavoidable.

"Argh!"

A groan of terror escaped involuntarily, but the expected impact never came.

When he opened his eyes, Shirone was still beside him.

'He changed direction.'

Evasion was better than mutual suicide, but having lost distance meant victory had slipped away.

The female and male students fell with satisfied expressions, and Mark seized Shirone's leading position.

'Damn it...!'

With his repetitive compulsion broken by the recent evasion, Shirone gritted his teeth and concentrated desperately to restore his Teleportation tempo.

"Didn't those kids' movements seem strange just now?"

The advanced class students began talking.

"I felt that too. Maybe they got tangled up from pushing too hard? Surely they weren't really trying to crash into each other."

"No, they did it on purpose."

The Class Five students turned around.

The owner of the metallic, thin voice was Iruki, a Mercenary from Class Five.

He was the same person who had given Shirone advice in the Image Zone before - a scrawny boy with mismatched eyes and crooked teeth.

"How can you be so sure? In cases like this, there might be suspicion, but unless you're directly involved, you can't know for certain."

Iruki opened his palm and struck it with his fist as he spoke.

"One person blocks the path while another attacks from the side. It's an excellent strategy that simultaneously seals both the immediacy of Teleportation and spatial jumping. If Shirone hadn't evaded, the match would have ended there. Of course, if it were me, I could have calculated the equations of motion and escaped at the most precise timing."

His classmates turned their heads back toward the test area.

'What a show-off.'

Meanwhile, Shirone began to grow increasingly anxious as the gap with Mark widened.

Remaining distance: 350 meters.

At the halfway point, all participants except Shirone and Mark had been eliminated.

'I won! I actually won!'

The moment Mark became certain of first place, he shuddered with excitement.

No one stood in his way, and despite casting nearly 40 Teleportations, he didn't even feel tired.

'Today I'm different from usual. I'm the one who'll pass!'

Visions flashed through his mind: rapid promotion to Class Five, the envious faces of his peers, the humiliation of Class Six upperclassmen.

"Hahaha! I'm in first place!"

As Mark accelerated his Teleportation tempo, the distance between him and Shirone began to widen further.

'In that case...'

Shirone's rhythm suddenly quickened, and the sonic booms of his Teleportation echoed like drumbeats.

The students' excitement reached its peak.

"Shirone's starting to catch up! This is the decisive moment!"

"Mark! More! Faster! More, more, more!"

That's when Mark's eyes detected a strange change.

The iron rods of the Unbridgeable Bridge began bending geometrically and rushing toward him at tremendous speed.

If even his toes caught on them, broken bones would be the least of his worries - his balance would be lost and a fall would be inevitable.

-Warning. Warning. Activating the mechanisms of the Unbridgeable Bridge. Level 10. Level 10.

The advanced class students were horrified.

"Level 10?"

The highest difficulty of the Unbridgeable Bridge.

Even the upper classes of the advanced level had never seen the iron rods bend in such a menacing formation.

"What on earth is happening! How did the mechanisms suddenly activate!"

The teachers fell into chaos.

Not only had the safety devices been disabled, but now the highest difficulty trap had been activated.

"What is Teacher Thad doing! He went to the control room!"

"Headmaster, what should we do? The advancement exam..."

Alpheas looked at the bent iron rods about to strike Shirone and Mark and clicked his tongue.

He knew what kind of determination students brought to their graduation exams and wanted to respect their will as much as possible, but if this was Level 10 of the Unbridgeable Bridge, that was a different story.

'There's no discrimination ability to begin with. Those boys' class levels can't pass this.'

Alpheas spoke bitterly.

"Cancel the exam and disable the mechanisms."

The moment his words fell, a streak of light shot up into the sky above the test area.

It was Siena, who had gone to find Thad at the control room.

* * *

Meanwhile, unaware of the test area situation, Thad was snorting angrily as he approached the control room entrance.

"Damn it! Just let me catch whoever did this!"

Since no sane staff member would disable the mechanisms, it had to be some troublemakers from the school playing pranks.

"Who the hell...!"

He shouted while roughly turning the door handle, but heard the click of it being locked from inside.

"You bastard!"

Expanding his Spirit Zone, he sensed someone sitting with their back against the door inside.

Thad ignited flames in his hand and said,

"Open up. I'm going to cast Fire Strike. If you don't open it, I'll blow you away too."

"I don't care. No, please do exactly that, teacher."

Unexpectedly, it was Maria's voice.

Though he wasn't her dedicated teacher, she had been attending the school since before Thad's appointment, so there was no mistaking her.

"Maria? What are you doing?"

"I'm sorry, teacher. Please don't forgive me."

"Open the door. Let's see your face first and then talk."

"I'll be expelled now, won't I? No wait, will I go to prison?"

"No, Maria. I don't know what circumstances you have, but I'll listen. Just open the door first."

"I don't care. I don't want to live. I wish I could just die like this."

Thad extinguished his blazing flames.

"Sigh. Fine, if you don't want to come out, don't."

From Maria's usual behavior, she clearly wasn't in her right mind, so smashing the door wouldn't help anyway.

Thad sat with his back against the iron door and looked up at the sky of Alpheas Magic School, which he had found tedious in his childhood.

Just the fact that he wasn't shouting at her to come out immediately helped calm Maria's mind somewhat.

"Teacher."

"What?"

"You hate me, don't you?"

"I don't hate women."

He fundamentally liked women, but this statement carried a different weight - it was Thad's own peculiar belief.

"Why is the world so unfair?"

"Haha! Don't like it being unfair? It's rare to be born as pretty as you."

"You don't understand, teacher - someone called a genius magician. You don't know what it's like to have no talent. Even when I want to do well, despair comes first. It feels like nothing will work no matter what I do. Do you know how hopeless that feeling is?"

"...I do."

Maria turned her head toward the iron door.

"You do, teacher?"

"I graduated at twenty-two, so it's already been four years since I became a teacher. When you enrolled, I would have been in the graduating class. You knew I was an alumnus here, right?"

"Yes."

"Then think back. Do you remember ever hearing about a student named Thad attending this school?"

Come to think of it, she couldn't recall anything at all.

Even Shirone's case, becoming the talk of the students immediately upon enrollment, was unusual.

"No. I've never heard of it."

"Of course not. My grades were mid-to-low, no talent, and my family wasn't well-off either. I was always fighting outside school and wandering around."

"You, teacher?"

"Yes. I took exactly two years every time I advanced a class. I was stuck in the graduating class for three years. Haha! Of course, the situation looks a bit better than yours right now."

Thad imagined Maria's sulking expression as he spoke.

"But isn't it all the same anyway? Unless you can be the best, everyone gets broken eventually. I was the same. Somehow I made it to the graduating class, but I failed every time."

"But how did you..."

"Become a successful teacher? It was all luck. Although I say I did my best, I didn't work as hard as others, and I got sick of struggling to beat someone. But one day, someone said this to me."

Thad recalled that time as he spoke.

"The reason you can't win in competition isn't because you can't win, but because you don't want to win."

Maria quietly repeated those words.

"Maria, you don't necessarily have to beat someone. If you like magic, that's enough. There are people in this world who don't want to compete with others. Like me."

The ten-year-old girl who had enrolled because she loved magic was now battered and broken nine years later.

"My life changed after meeting that person. When I think about it, it's really strange. A teacher saying such things."

"Was that person a teacher?"

"Yes. My master, Headmaster Alpheas."

Maria's head whipped around.

"What? The headmaster?"

"After that day, I became his official disciple and received personal guidance. It was an incredible privilege. Thanks to that, my life took off. Being taught by a renowned magician from the continent, even trash like me gets called a genius and lives comfortably. How about it? Envious? Life is all about luck. Hahaha!"

Maria became dejected again.

"So what I want to tell you is that the world is ultimately unfair. Some are born with talent, some throw themselves into competition like mad dogs. But sometimes miracles happen even to people like me who have no talent and hate competition. That's why everyone lives with hope, isn't it?"

Thad stood up and turned around.

"Miracles can come to anyone. It would be a waste of all the time you've invested to give up already. How about trying just a little more, just a tiny bit more?"

Maria buried her face in her knees.

"Should someone with no talent like me spend my life waiting for a miracle that might or might not come? What if it doesn't? What happens to me then?"

"What are you talking about, Maria?"

Thad placed his hand on the iron door and smiled.

"Look, a miracle has come to you right now."

Tears welled up in Maria's eyes.

"Let's try again with me. I may not have succeeded like others, but don't judge yourself so quickly. You might have just had really bad luck. Your methods might have been wrong. School lessons aren't efficient for everyone. So won't you entrust yourself to me one more time? I'll definitely make you into a magician."

Maria covered her face with both hands.

"Teacher, really? Can I do it too?"

"You can. If magic is everything in your life, there's absolutely no need to give up."

A clunking sound was heard, and Maria emerged with swollen eyes, having unlocked the door, and shouted urgently.

"Teacher! Quickly, the mechanism... The mechanism...!"

"Huh? Mechanism?"

Even with a 700-meter jump, Teleportation magic shouldn't take very long.

By now they should be nearing the end of the test, and since there had been no news so far, it seemed the advancement exam had ended safely thanks to the teachers' capabilities.

At that moment, betraying Thad's expectations, a sharp sound rang out as light crashed down.

"Teacher Thad! What are you doing right now!"

Siena's face, as she rushed toward them with blazing eyes, was filled with both anger and urgency.

She was about to grab Thad by the collar when she spotted Maria and looked bewildered.

"Maria? Why are you here?"

Thad asked.

"Why? Is something wrong?"

Siena shouted again.

"Quickly disable the mechanisms! The Unbridgeable Bridge difficulty has been set to Level 10!"

"What?"

It wasn't just the safety devices that had been disabled?

Remembering Maria's words, Thad realized the truth and hurriedly headed toward the control room.

Just then, another streak of light curved in.

Ethella, who had arrived via spatial movement, spotted Siena and Thad and came running frantically.

"Teacher! This is terrible, terrible!"

Since a truly massive trap had indeed been activated, Siena was struck with immediate fear.

"What's wrong? Don't tell me there was an accident..."

Ethella shouted with eyes still shocked.

"Shirone... Shirone!"
