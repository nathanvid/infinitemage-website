title: Chapter 37 - The Unbridgeable Bridge (4)
date: 2025-08-27

The teachers fell into a state of panic.

It was the first time in advanced class that the difficulty of the Unbridgeable Bridge had risen to level 10.

"Teacher! L-look over there!"

One teacher raised his hand and pointed.

Shirone and Mark were leaping into the center of the iron rods that were intertwined in a three-dimensional structure.

"Damn it! How reckless!"

The judgment of those engaged in the fierce battle was to continue the test as it was.

Their determination for advancement was admirable, but from the teachers' perspective, it seemed like nothing but a suicide mission.

'This is an incredible trap. How do we get out of this?'

Even in a life-or-death situation, Shirone was only searching for a way to pass through the Unbridgeable Bridge.

The structure created by the bending iron rods was a 'wave progression system,' an endless composition that surged forward like waves.

'Just waiting in place won't help—the traps will keep coming endlessly.'

Ultimately, the key was to break through the waves in the shortest time possible and somehow reach the other side.

The first wave was structured so that the iron rods bent and surged forward like whips, and Mark, who easily avoided it, gained some confidence.

'If it's this much, then...'

No matter how difficult the level, only first place had the privilege of advancement.

'The higher the danger level, the greater the discrimination. This actually works out well.'

Mark's competitive spirit shone even in this situation.

'No! This is terrible!'

In contrast, Shirone was calculating not just the immediate danger, but also the future disasters that would come.

Based on his observations from the wave's starting point, the level 10 obstacles weren't structured in a way that could be escaped by avoiding each trap as it came.

Unless you moved while having analyzed all the waves—first, second, third, at least five or more—you would eventually be cornered into a dead end.

"What, what is this?"

As expected, Mark showed a dazed expression the moment he avoided the first trap.

After the vertical wave came a double horizontal line surging forward, followed by a triple horizontal line that rippled like waves.

Given the speed of the iron rods' advance, even a slight mistiming would have bone-breaking force.

'No. He can't avoid that.'

Shirone, who had been monitoring the situation from a position higher than the third trap, quickly descended toward Mark, who was in a situation where his back might break at any moment.

"Ugh!"

Just before Mark got caught in the trap, students who imagined the terrible outcome squeezed their eyes shut.

But no screams were heard, and when they opened their eyes again, Shirone was embracing Mark's waist and chaining Teleportation to escape the trap.

"Shirone!"

Saving Mark showed great courage, but it also seemed like a reckless choice.

Moreover, they were strictly in the middle of a test.

"What's this? Being kind has its limits too."

"How can you say that? When someone's about to die, isn't it natural?"

"Natural? Could you do the same thing?"

"Hey! Why am I suddenly brought into this?"

While the students were engaged in heated argument, only Iruki wore a meaningful smile.

'That's not it, you fools...'

The traps stretched to the end of their vision, and Shirone's heart felt stifled looking at them.

When the net-shaped trap approached, it was the first time since the test began that his mind went pale.

'How are we supposed to avoid that?'

Facing a massive trap covering 20 square meters, he felt like an insect waiting for a fly swatter.

"Ahhh! Save, save me!"

Mark began to struggle frantically.

Once his courage was broken, it would be impossible to regain his composure during the test.

We're going to die here.

The number of approaching traps was endless enough to give that conviction, and their forms were becoming increasingly bizarre.

"Stay still for a moment!"

Shirone racked his brain looking for a breakthrough, but Teleportation was powerless against the massive wall where there wasn't even space to escape.

'No, no. If it were a trap with no escape, they wouldn't have created it in the first place.'

At that moment, a lightning-like thought struck his mind.

'That's it!'

"Ahhhhh! We're all going to die!"

At the same time Mark screamed, Shirone cast Teleportation, causing Iruki to jump up and shout.

"That's exactly it!"

Shirone, who chose to retreat with Teleportation, increased the distance faster than the net's approach speed.

He had forgotten that there was empty space behind him because he was obsessed with the idea of crossing the bridge.

'If I retreat to secure enough distance and then jump over the entire net, it's simple.'

Timing it right, Shirone ascended diagonally, and the outer frame of the net barely grazed his toes as it passed.

'Cleared for now. But...'

Level 10 difficulty wasn't going to be easy.

As Shirone gained altitude, the iron rods adjusted their positions upward accordingly, and the next trap was surging forward.

Seriel shouted in frustration.

"Why is he doing such a reckless thing? If Mark gets eliminated, he's guaranteed to advance."

Amy said.

"He won't make that choice. That's just his personality."

"I know he's kind. But there's no need to go that far. I can't prove it, but Mark did the despicable thing of hiring kids to interfere."

"Shirone doesn't want to get first place."

He's not competing to get numbers given by others.

"He wants to pass the advancement test and reach a higher level. He knows that if he can't convince himself, advancing would be meaningless."

Amy understood Shirone's heart completely, but that's why she felt even more sorry for him.

'But this time, the luck ran out. It's too dangerous. This test should be stopped here.'

Level 10 of the Unbridgeable Bridge cannot be crossed by anyone at Class Four level.

Although Shirone was still holding on, based on Amy's experience, the difficulty of the traps he had passed so far was at most level 6.

"Ahhhhhhh! Ahhhhhhh!"

Mark's eyes turned white as he screamed loud enough to hurt their ears, and he finally foamed at the mouth and fainted.

In contrast, Shirone's mind became even sharper.

At some point, forgetting even his own existence, the teachers who had been stomping their feet as he passed through traps, and the students who had been making a fuss, now maintained silence.

Even Alpheas was repeatedly amazed, his gaze captivated by Shirone's dazzling movements.

'Crisis brings out potential. But everyone has limits to their endurance. So how?'

How can he still hold on?

Currently, the Unbridgeable Bridge was racing at 200 kilometers per hour.

In a situation where ordinary students would be overwhelmed by speed alone and lose consciousness.

Yet Shirone was flashing like lightning through the dark iron rod structures, penetrating them.

'From the beginning, were there no limits?'

Even when on an upward trajectory, the reason one cannot rise endlessly is that every human has a moment when they become satisfied with themselves.

Magic was the same.

The reason not every magician becomes the greatest—is it only a matter of skill or talent?

The limitation called capacity, which makes one satisfied upon reaching a certain level, is an irresistible barrier that inevitably affects human psychology.

'Shirone, are you dreaming of infinity with a human body?'

It seems like there's no vessel to begin with.

Because there's no standard for satisfaction itself, his mind is coping with the endlessly rising difficulty.

Shirone, who must be in a state of selfless absorption, might not remember this moment.

But Ethella, the youngest bishop of the Karsis Monastery, seemed like she would never forget Shirone's martial dance that she witnessed today.

'He's continuously finding escape routes close to one in infinity in real time.'

What kind of mind makes that possible?

'It's mental strength that even great masters can maintain only in a state of complete transcendence.'

The structure was now passing through complex stages and becoming so twisted it felt eerie.

It was a chaotic trap where no rules could be felt.

'I need to break it down even smaller.'

As the waves shortened to the point where they couldn't be avoided without moving within one meter, Shirone's jumping distance also decreased.

If it wasn't a situation where he could avoid one and calculate the next, he had to analyze everything from the beginning and jump in.

Left-right-left-left-right-left...

Shirone imprinted the ring-shaped overlapping traps flying toward him in his eyes and recalled the pattern.

When he cast Teleportation, flashes moved in zigzags penetrating between structures, but this time the same type of trap surged vertically.

There wasn't even time to calculate the pattern.

'It needs to be denser!'

Time was broken down even smaller, and the flash of Teleportation curved downward in a parabolic arc.

While students and even teachers gaped, Iruki raised his squinting eye and shouted.

"Rainbow Drop! He finally reached that level!"

The flash curving like waves penetrated through the center of the circle, swimming through like a loach.

Rainbow Drop was an advanced technique of Teleportation, magic possible only at the level of graduating class majors.

Therefore, the advanced class students couldn't understand the current situation where flashes curved to escape the traps.

"Is that really possible? How can Teleportation curve? Light only moves in straight lines!"

Iruki tapped his head and said.

"It's a simple principle. If you differentiate a circle, you get infinite straight lines. He broke down the intervals of Teleportation to about one thousandth."

"One thousandth? Can humans do that?"

"Even if calculation is impossible, you can imagine it sensually. He's more omnipotent than omniscient. In short, you could say he's a genius of the opposite nature from me."

The students turned their heads as if ignoring Iruki's words.

'He likes calling people geniuses. Just a Class Five student.'

Meanwhile, the speed of the Unbridgeable Bridge was reaching its peak.

The afterimages of the iron rods grew longer, to the point where even the shape of the structures couldn't be distinguished unless you were the person whose eyes had adapted.

Shirone's figure escaping through those afterimages had reached beyond technique to the level of art.

Everyone was mesmerized by the sight of breaking straight light into small pieces to operate curved trajectories.

"Could it really... work?"

The remaining distance to the Unbridgeable Bridge's destination was only about 30 meters.

Now even the students put aside other thoughts and were wholeheartedly cheering for Shirone's passage.

It was a situation where, for the first time in magic school history, an advanced class student might master the Unbridgeable Bridge.

"Headmaster! Over there!"

When someone pointed to the bridge's destination, all the teachers watching that spot turned pale.

What had to come finally came.

From the destination point, iron rods began to twist like burning hair, starting to create a massive three-dimensional structure.

"It's the Dragon's Maze! That won't work! Quickly disable the device!"

The Dragon's Maze was a trap that appeared only once at level 10, named so because its completed form resembled a dragon's face.

Though the appearance was similar, the internal structure was different each time it was created, and the length of iron rods used to construct the trap reached 600 meters.

It was a terrifying trap where you'd be swallowed by the dragon and torn to pieces unless you identified the escape pattern by understanding the iron rods' twisting process in advance.

Even to Shirone's eyes, which were concentrated to their limit, the sight of the iron rods twisting seemed ominous.

Forgetting even to blink, as he was storing the structure's pattern in his mind, he felt movement at his side.

"Ahhh! What is this! Someone save me!"

When the regained Mark discovered the trap that had grown gigantic beyond time, he screamed as if his throat would tear.

To his eyes, not having passed through the traps step by step, it was a feast of traps racing so fast he couldn't even think of analyzing them.

'It's coming!'

Even in that situation, the Dragon's Maze was charging forward with its mouth open at the highest speed in history.
