With just over one second until impact, even Shirone's heart couldn't help but sink.

'I can't give up!'

As electrical stimulation struck his brain, Shirone reorganized his Spirit Zone that had been shaken by Mark's scream.

This took one-tenth of a second.

Shirone thought: Was there time to spare?

But while one could imagine dividing one second by ten, it was impossible to feel 0.1 seconds ten times over.

Therefore, there was only one method: keep dividing it further.

One-hundredth of a second.

He mentally reconstructed the process of the dragon's maze being created.

Overall shape: a heptagonal star. Six branching paths.

One-thousandth of a second.

After retracing the maze's structure, he found the exit.

To escape would require casting Teleportation at least nine times in rapid succession.

'No good! It's impossible while carrying Mark!'

If there wasn't room for two people to escape, he had no choice but to find another route.

At that moment, the dragon's maze swallowed Shirone whole.

The male students simply turned their heads away, while the female students screamed as they imagined the gruesome ending.

Seriel's scream was the loudest.

BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BANG!

The explosive sounds thundering through the confined space sounded like the death cries of Shirone and Mark.

And finally, the sound disappeared.

One ten-thousandth of a second.

In that infinitesimally brief moment that was too fleeting even to savor with insight, Shirone once again analyzed every pattern and found the exit.

The flash of Teleportation burst out from the dragon's maze, and Shirone, blazing with brilliant light, crossed the finish line and landed.

"Haa, haa."

Shirone set Mark down and walked a few more steps before his knees gave out and he collapsed.

Unable to make a sound, the students stared at Shirone with terror-stricken eyes as if they were seeing a ghost.

Ethella cast spatial movement toward Siena, who had left to find Thad, and shortly after the mechanisms shut down, Echo's voice was heard.

-Deactivating the Unbridgeable Bridge mechanisms. Level Zero. Level Zero.

The iron rods slowed their movement and the structures that had grown like wooden vines began to regain their horizontal positions, returning to the original form of the Unbridgeable Bridge.

"What, what the..."

The students felt only one thing.

"Is this really possible?"

"This is insane. It was Level 10. And he passed through the dragon's maze too."

At the sound of students murmuring, Shirone, who had been sitting collapsed on the ground, finally came to his senses and looked around.

'What? Why are they looking at me?'

Though his memory had gaps in places, crossing the Unbridgeable Bridge was an unchangeable fact.

Only then did reality settle in his mind, and Shirone's face turned into a grimace.

"Ugh, I really thought I was going to die."

It was a disappointingly ungraceful statement to come from someone who had just made history.

But Seriel knew this was exactly the Shirone from before jumping off the cliff.

"Amy! Shirone did it! Your boyfriend did it!"

She could have done without the "boyfriend" part, but seeing Seriel crying tears of joy, Amy let it slide this time.

Students rushed over competitively to speak with Shirone.

"Congratulations! You were really amazing!"

"So now you're advancing to Class Five? Hahaha! The Class Six kids must be pretty bitter about this!"

While Shirone received congratulations, the teachers who had gone to the control room and Maria arrived via spatial movement.

Siena checked on Shirone first.

Though he was overwhelmed being surrounded by students, he didn't appear to be seriously injured.

'He passed through the dragon's maze? How did he manage that? It's a difficulty level that even graduating students practice dozens of times.'

When she glared at the person who had made her miss this historic moment, Thad shrugged his shoulders defensively.

"As you know, or maybe you don't, I did my best in my own way."

Siena sighed and walked over to Alpheas.

It was unlikely, but if Shirone and Mark had entered simultaneously, it would be best to announce the results clearly to avoid any gossip.

"Headmaster, we should announce the successful candidate first..."

Alpheas, who had been lost in thought, came to his senses and spoke to the students with a benevolent smile.

"The successful candidate for the early advancement exam is Arian Shirone. I will advance Shirone to Class Five. However, I am proud of all the students who participated in the exam. The courage you showed today will be the driving force that leads Alpheas Magic School forward. I hope you will continue to strive and achieve good results."

Applause that started with the upperclassmen continued with the underclassmen.

No one harbored any more complaints about Shirone's early advancement, and even Mark, who had faced him directly, had no choice but to acknowledge it.

'So genius really does exist.'

The scene of Teleportation being cast at tremendous speed in the dragon's maze was still vividly etched in his mind.

It wasn't a matter of talent.

In impossible situations, some people become frustrated and retreat, but there are those who think only of overcoming it.

'This leaves no room for excuses.'

Mark walked over to Shirone on trembling legs.

Most students had expected some kind of agreement in this test, but Mark, as if he had already prepared himself, acknowledged his defeat in front of everyone.

"Senior, I have lost. It was a magnificent match and I learned so much! Please take care of me from now on!"

Since Alpheas had given his approval, from now on he would have to address him as senior.

"Yeah, you worked hard today. I'll work hard too."

Amy, who had been watching this scene with satisfaction, turned around and spoke to Seriel.

"Let's go down now."

"Huh? Why leave already? On a day like this, you should be with your boyfriend."

"There's no time for that. Now that Shirone succeeded, it's my turn. I need to prepare for the advancement exam too."

"Are you really okay leaving like this?"

Amy's steps were just as reluctant, but she felt she needed to do something immediately to calm her excitement.

"Amy."

When Shirone called out, Amy turned around with a start.

As the two faced each other, the surrounding students muttered in blank amazement.

"Did he just call her by name?"

"Of course. They're dating, aren't they?"

"Even so, she's Senior Amy..."

Amy, who had never lost first place even once, meant more than just a senior to the underclassmen.

Given that she was evaluated as capable enough to excel even if she entered the graduating class right now, the current situation was surprising.

Shirone ignored the reactions around him and smiled at Amy while holding up two fingers.

"Two steps left now."

"Haha..."

Amy's lips trembled as they curved upward.

If she passed the graduating class advancement test, the gap between her and Shirone would be just two steps.

"Let's go, Seriel."

"Huh? Oh, okay."

As Amy turned and walked away, Seriel hurriedly followed her down the mountain.

Except for Class Seven, the other advanced class students also scattered one by one, and only then did Thad approach Alpheas.

"Headmaster, I have something to tell you about Maria."

Thad reported everything that had happened in the control room without omission.

"I see. How could such a mistake happen..."

As Alpheas muttered with a regretful expression, Maria approached and bowed deeply.

"I'm sorry. I made an irreversible mistake. Whatever punishment I receive, I'll accept it willingly."

"Hmm, for now..."

Just then, Mark interrupted.

"I have something to confess. Everything that happened today was because of me."

The teachers' gazes turned to where Mark stood with a defiant expression.

"What do you mean, because of you?"

"Actually, this morning I really got under Maria's skin. To be honest, if I had heard those kinds of things, I would have lost it too. So I'll take the disciplinary action. I'm the one who caused it."

Siena said.

"Even so, there were problems with Maria's actions too. And why are you saying this? It's something that could have been overlooked."

"I'm not a good guy, but I'm not pathetic enough to cause trouble without being prepared to take responsibility. The kids all know about it anyway, so keeping quiet would be embarrassing too. And I should add that I was also the one who planned the strategy to check Senior Shirone."

Mark had lived thinking that winning was everything in any situation, but his battle with Shirone this time had taught him something.

'Overwhelming with ability.'

The sight of setting aside petty thoughts and focusing solely on overcoming the obstacle ahead to seize victory was a shock intense enough to completely shake the mindset that had formed Mark until now.

"Anyway, that's how it was. Whatever disciplinary action I receive, I'll accept it willingly, but please go easy on the other kids. Especially Maria..."

Mark glanced at Maria and said.

"She must have been under tremendous stress. We ganged up to torment her day after day. Unless she was going crazy, why would she do something like this?"

Alpheas also had deep thoughts about Maria.

Though her grades weren't good, she was a magic student who had trained silently for longer than anyone else at the school.

Seeing her in crisis of expulsion after making an irreversible mistake, he couldn't help but see his younger self.

'Master...'

Thad, who knew Alpheas's past, looked at him with a heavy heart.

The Light of the Mirhi Family.

Alpheas first made his name with light magic.

Though it had become obsolete theory now, at the time it was such an ingenious idea that he even received the Gold Circle Award granted by the king.

But his brilliant talent plunged young Alpheas into a swamp of confusion.

What if he hadn't wandered in darkness for ten years due to one moment of poor judgment?

Perhaps Alpheas might have become a great magician whose name would be etched in history.

"Both of you will be referred to the disciplinary committee. Maria has the crime of illegally operating the mechanisms to interfere with the exam. She also created unnecessary danger. However, considering that Mark provided the cause, this will be taken into account when determining the punishment."

As Maria and Mark bowed their heads, Class Seven students began raising their hands one by one.

"Teacher, I tormented Maria too. Then don't I also bear responsibility?"

"I joined the strategy team and attacked Senior Shirone."

That all of Class Seven raised their hands meant this Maria incident stemmed from a problem involving the entire class.

It was an issue that would have surfaced anyway, but the courage to voluntarily confess their crimes was worthy of magicians.

"Then I will discipline everyone. All of you return and await the judgment."

"What will happen to Maria?"

"It will be reflected in the disciplinary committee. Punishment will be given to the entire class, and Maria won't have to bear all the blame alone."

Though it wasn't a definitive answer, coming from none other than the headmaster, it carried considerable weight.

Siena asked.

"Isn't that too risky a statement? We don't even know how the discipline will be handed down yet."

"We are teachers. We are people who guide students correctly, not judges who pass judgment. Those children are disciples we must teach and raise."

Maria couldn't hold back and burst into tears.

"Thank you. I'm sorry."

A smile spread across Thad's lips as he watched her.

'Good for you, Maria.'

This situation was probably a miraculous opportunity that would never come again in Maria's life.

Just like when Thad had met Alpheas.

'The world is about luck, but... if you give up, you can't even obtain that luck.'

If Maria didn't truly love magic, could she have endured all that time in Class Seven?

Though the world was unfair, Thad thought it was worth living because of that.

If you truly dream earnestly and endure, opportunity comes to everyone.
