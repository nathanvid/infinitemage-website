Shirone was promoted to Class Five.

It was fortunate that Siena, who knew the unique study method called the "spine of knowledge," became his dedicated teacher.

Since he had jumped up two class levels at once, there were times when he couldn't keep up with the curriculum, but Shirone persisted with his original approach to the very end.

Advanced classes took tests once a week and underwent final exams at the end of each month to determine rankings for that month. Shirone placed 40th out of 40 students on his first test.

There were 11 subjects in total, with an average score of only 32 points.

However, it was noteworthy that his scores across all subjects were evenly distributed between 30 and 33 points.

His average score on the second theory exam was 34 points.

'A 2-point average increase might seem trivial. But...'

The scores for all subjects had risen simultaneously.

The third test showed similar results, but this time with an even steeper upward trend, with all subject scores distributed between 36 and 39 points.

'Everything is rising at once.'

Looking at the graph of Shirone's overall improving grades, one could feel his determination.

'That's fortunate. Staying in the lower ranks for too long could lead to a decline in confidence.'

The graph showed no sign of such anxiety, and he was steadily walking his own path.

'Theory tests are important. They're one of the main items for evaluating omnipotence.'

Teachers generally consider 60 points or above as the minimum standard for being able to cast magic.

'If he raises his scores by 10 points each month, basic magic operation will be possible starting three months from now. If that happens...'

He would be able to perform the fundamentals of magic in less than six months.

Of course, humans aren't machines, so aptitude varies according to disposition, and the gap widens as scores get higher.

But looking at the current graph, there was a strange sense of anticipation that it might actually be possible.

Just how far could he raise his scores without missing a single subject?

Shirone's potential would be determined by those results.

'His relationships with classmates are also harmonious.'

No student looked down on Shirone for his low grades.

At the Class Five level, students' immediate concern isn't their current ranking but graduating class.

Countries around the world spare no expense in maintaining the highest level of magic systems, and in such circumstances, what's important for students is specializing in their major to differentiate themselves from other mages.

Therefore, students who didn't yet have any particular specialty envied Shirone, who was a light specialist.

'I think the photon field suits him well too.'

Above all, the photon field was an area where omnipotence played a larger role than omniscience.

Of course, the omniscience side had also built up considerably developed theories, but there were inevitably limits to what the human mind could achieve when utilizing the properties of light.

In fact, if Shirone hadn't felt the segmentation of time through insight, he wouldn't have been able to complete the Unbridgeable Bridge.

For this reason, his classmates couldn't look down on Shirone, and during integrated classes, underclassmen frequently greeted him.

Ironically, among the underclassmen, the student who followed Shirone most faithfully was Mark, who had returned from disciplinary action.

"Senior, please sit here. I saved this seat for you."

"Thanks."

Mark, who was like the leader of Class Seven, felt proud that he could be close friends with Shirone.

"Oh my! You were here? Is there a seat for me too?"

"Gasp! Hello, senior!"

Mark jumped up and greeted Seriel.

If it was Seriel, she was someone in the upper ranks of Class Four, an unreachable senior.

Acting as if she didn't mind, Seriel waved her hand casually and immediately stuck close to Shirone as soon as she sat next to him.

"Our Shirone looks tired lately. Well, it's natural since your girlfriend left, isn't it?"

"Haha! It's not like that."

A week ago, Amy took the promotion test and finally advanced to graduating class.

According to Seriel, she passed easily, but it was obvious without seeing that she must have gritted her teeth and trained intensively for it.

"You must be lonelier than me, senior. You were always together with Amy."

"That's true. But it's okay. I'm thinking of entering graduating class soon too."

"What? Graduating class?"

Seriel was certainly qualified for it.

Although Class Four had many formidable talents, she also had the ability to stand out in healing magic.

Moreover, since graduating class was a class that focused solely on one's major, healing magic with its high discrimination value would have many advantages.

"It's not like I'm following a friend there... but I was also stimulated by watching you, just like Amy was. Originally, my dream was to just enter some health clinic and live comfortably, but somehow I thought it would be a waste to end things like this."

Hearing from the mouth of a prodigy recognized by the school that working at a health clinic was her dream made Mark look dejected.

"If you say that, senior, what happens to me?"

"Hehe, don't worry too much. I didn't make it this far because I was particularly good at something either. Anyone can make it to Class Four if they work hard. Shirone is just a special case."

Shirone hurriedly waved his hands.

"No, I was actually quite lucky too. The promotion test I took last time wasn't even a regular process."

"Don't be so modest. I guarantee you'll enter graduating class soon too. Although Amy is desperately insisting that she absolutely won't have a graduating class peer. Hehe, anyway, work hard."

'Absolutely no graduating class peers.'

It was a very Amy-like statement, and imagining her gritting her teeth and devoting herself to training made his body feel hot.

"Right. Speaking of which, has Amy decided on her major?"

"What? You still don't know? I've thought this before, but you two really date in such a bland way."

"That's just how we are."

When Shirone smiled and brushed it off, Seriel rested her chin on her hand and fell into thought.

"Hmm, Amy's specialty is flame magic, and her Four-Direction Style is specialized in target form. From what I heard recently, she seems to be aiming to become a sniper."

Most flame mages aspire to be combat mages, but sniper was quite a unique field.

"A sniper... doesn't that mean becoming a soldier?"

Reading Shirone's feelings, Seriel smiled bitterly.

"Can't help it. I also think it's a bit odd for Amy to become a soldier, but it's normal to choose a career based on where your talent lies. Besides, Amy is from the Carmis family, a First-class house. For the family's honor, she has to do something."

Shirone was worried.

"But it's dangerous work. Depending on circumstances, she'd have to go to battlefields and harm people."

"That might happen, but when war actually breaks out, majors don't matter at all. Anyone with a mage profession will be deployed to the battlefield without exception. Magic schools will also become training camps producing reserve mages under the Kingdom's orders. From that point on, there's no graduation or anything. Basic military training and unconditional deployment."

It was a bitter truth that was hard to swallow.

"That's why it's a special purpose school. Even if deaths occur during education, students bear half the responsibility."

"Speaking coldly, we're ultimately appendages of the Kingdom. Rather, the more outstanding talents like Amy there are, the stronger the war deterrent becomes."

"That's true, but..."

Although Tormia was a reasonably powerful nation, peace couldn't be maintained at all times, so being a soldier wasn't a safe profession.

Diplomatic friction could lead to war with other countries, and if allied kingdoms requested support, Amy would inevitably have to fight on the front lines.

The belligerent Mark didn't think seriously about that and was interested in something else.

"Amy senior becoming an officer - just imagining it, she'd be incredibly popular in the unit. Honestly, senior's cute appearance and soldier don't go together."

"Hohoho! That's because you don't know Amy's personality. I think it would actually suit her quite well? And Shirone, don't worry too much. Mages don't engage in sword fighting on battlefields anyway, and snipers mainly focus on espionage. When you think about it, isn't it cool? Beautiful spy agent Amy."

"Haha, that's true too."

Shirone stopped thinking there.

While he was worried, perhaps the prodigy who had never missed first place in school had made her choice with good reason.

He felt that worrying excessively about a decision the person involved had made would actually damage Amy's pride.

After theory class ended and it was time for actual Spirit Zone practice, students rose from their seats.

Since practice was organized by class, Shirone also parted from Mark and Seriel and headed to where Class Five students were gathered.

Class Five was the class with the most same-age students gathered together even among advanced classes, and Shirone's age was exactly included in that average cutoff line.

Although they burned with rivalry during exams, it was also a class where they could forget competition and laugh and chat normally.

Thanks to this, Shirone could also train his Spirit Zone with less concern about others' opinions compared to other classes.

His peers spoke to him without hesitation when needed, and when they got a little bored, they would visit other friends for casual conversation.

"Shirone, burning brightly today too. Want to practice together if you're okay with it?"

Nade from Class Five approached him.

A mischievous face with light green hair swaying.

His personality was as cheerful as his appearance, with good social skills, and he was a meddlesome boy who couldn't bear to see anyone left out of a group.

Perhaps magic resembles personality, as his grades also had no subjects he was exceptionally good or bad at.

The only unique thing was that among various magic systems, he could use the quite rare electrical magic.

'Electricity... It's similar to light but a different field.'

Magic is classified with different importance of omniscience and omnipotence depending on which attribute you learn.

For example, if light magic relies more on omnipotence than omniscience, ice magic tends to depend on omniscience capabilities.

When categorized that way, electrical magic was a field impossible without balancing omniscience and omnipotence in a 5-to-5 ratio.

'Maybe this also resembles his personality.'

That's what Shirone initially thought, but after coming to Class Five and actually hearing about it, there were separate circumstances.

Nade's dream wasn't to be a mage but a magical engineer.

Thanks to consistently handling electricity from a young age, his understanding of omniscience and omnipotence naturally improved, and therefore he had no particular problems using electrical magic even after entering magic school.

"Sure, let's do it together. Then Four-Direction Style..."

"By the way, about Amy senior, what's she actually like when you meet her? Does she have a really feminine personality?"

When Shirone agreed, Nade immediately pushed practice to the back burner and brought up conversation topics.

'I knew he'd do this.'

He had a talent for gathering people, and if there was even a small topic to discuss, students would definitely seek him out.

As if proving this point, two Class Five students walked toward them while arguing.

"Ah, seriously! That's not it! Why can't you understand what I'm saying?"

"That's what I'm telling you! What's really important isn't that! I've felt this before, but you really have a strange personality."

Shirone wore a dazed expression as the two approached while pointing at each other.

Seeing their voices getting louder, he wondered if they were having an in-depth discussion about magic.

"Oh! Perfect timing! Shironade, listen to what I have to say."

Class Five students called Shirone and Nade together "Shironade," and upon arriving, without deciding who would go first, they both pointed to themselves and began pouring out their stories.
