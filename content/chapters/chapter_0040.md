"Which of the teachers do you guys prefer, Teacher Ethella or Teacher Siena? Oh, Shirone probably doesn't care since he has Senior Amy, right? Nade, what about you?"

"Hmm. My preference would be Teacher Ethella. Though Teacher Siena is nice too."

"Ooh! A kindred spirit. Teacher Ethella is definitely the best. She has such a youthful face and an amazing figure. Especially her chest... whew."

Ethella was indeed attractive. She looked somewhat naive behind her large glasses, and though she carelessly tied up her waist-length hair, she was still beautiful. Her voluptuous figure—as if only her body had grown while retaining a child's face—was the number one object of student admiration.

The children who had been speaking passionately suddenly grew quiet and ended their conversation, moving away. Finding this strange, Shirone stopped his Spirit Zone and turned his head.

A bizarre-looking boy was walking toward them. It was Iruki, the eccentric mercenary from Class Five. Though his straightforward personality made his classmates keep their distance, Nade, everyone's friend, was different.

"Hey there, Iruki. Don't tell me you came here to practice?"

"No. Campus patrol. What were you talking about so enthusiastically?"

"Just the usual stuff. Which teacher is better, that kind of thing."

Nade suddenly realized and looked back at Shirone.

"Ah, Shirone! This is your first time talking with him, right? This guy is Iruki. Class Five's outsider."

Though it had been nearly a month since advancing to Class Five, this was Shirone's first time meeting Iruki face to face. Not because he'd avoided him intentionally, but because Iruki skipped classes more often than he attended them.

"Oh ho! Arian Shirone. Aren't you the genius the school is paying attention to? This is so glorious I should write it in my diary."

Shirone could understand why the other students kept their distance from him. His analytical gaze and the twisted feeling in his tone of voice were off-putting.

"Hello? I'm Shirone. Please take care of me from now on."

"Heh heh, what's this about a genius asking me to take care of him? I've been watching you since Class Seven. When you succeeded with the deviation form, and when you crossed the Unbridgeable Bridge."

"Huh? You were watching me?"

Shirone realized it in that moment. That thin voice like scraping metal. It was the voice that had given him advice when his Spirit Zone wavered under the children's criticism.

"So you were the one who spoke to me back then?"

"I said something because it was frustrating. I didn't like seeing you being swayed by little kids."

Though Iruki waved his hand dismissively as if it were bothersome, from Shirone's perspective it had been helpful. Without his advice, escaping that slump would have been much more difficult.

"Thank you. It really was a big help."

Iruki stared intently at Shirone.

"You're a really boring kid, aren't you?"

"Huh? Boring?"

It was the first time in his life he'd heard such a thing, and it strangely hurt his feelings. Then Nade stepped in with his excellent instincts to restore the atmosphere.

"Hey, hey! Iruki. Even so, it's rude to say that to someone who's thanking you."

Iruki shrugged his shoulders and turned around.

"Really? It was meant as a compliment. Anyway, work hard. Though it won't be easy, of course. There are a lot of troublemakers in Class Five. Heh heh heh."

Nade shouted at Iruki's retreating back.

"Hey, where are you going? Let's practice together."

"Too bothersome. I'd rather sleep."

Shirone opened his mouth in disbelief. Sleeping because class time was bothersome. Class Five was positioned at the top among the advanced classes. He couldn't understand how such a person could have made it this far.

"He seems to have a somewhat... strange personality."

"Sorry, Shirone. If you get to know him, he's not such a bad kid."

"But..."

"Haha! I know what you're thinking. We'd just tire ourselves out trying to figure him out. That guy is also a genius. The problem is he's a different type of genius from you."

"A genius? Iruki is a genius?"

"Aha! You wouldn't know since you haven't been here long."

Nade told him about Iruki as a person. Despite being called a genius, his grades were similar to Nade's. However, none of his classmates looked down on his abilities.

Iruki was the epitome of a one-sided human being. He consistently scored zero on subjects dominated by emotion like literature or arts, but he was a genius who could get perfect scores with his eyes closed on any subject requiring calculation ability.

Initially, teachers had also coveted Iruki's talent, competing to take charge of him. But his personality was so unruly that most had now given up.

Nevertheless, there were many teachers predicting he would soon leave Class Five, as there were stories that he had surpassed even graduates in mathematical fields.

Iruki's specialty was computational physics, a field only possible for those with special brain functions—a discipline that calculated phenomena occurring in extreme environments like temperatures exceeding 100 million degrees.

The academic world called brains capable of such calculations "savant syndrome." While it usually manifested in autistic children, savant syndrome could also appear in normal people.

The exact cause wasn't known, but the prevailing opinion was that when specific parts of the brain were damaged during the fetal period and then naturally healed, unique thought circuits different from normal humans opened up.

Insight also used thought circuits different from normal thinking, making it similar in some ways, but Iruki's savant syndrome was different in its aspect of mechanical calculation.

Iruki could derive the date 40,000 years from today within one minute. Also, if he didn't sleep, he could spend his entire life reciting the decimal digits of pi.

After hearing Nade's explanation, Shirone stared with his mouth agape. If that was really possible, it was an incredible talent.

"Why is someone like that still staying in Class Five? No, even so, how is it possible to get zero points? Even if he guessed, he'd get some questions right."

"Heh heh heh. That's the thing, he's always like this. About a month ago, something happened..."

Nade told him about an incident when Iruki took a theory exam. As expected, he got a perfect score in natural sciences, but there was a problem with something that caught the teacher's eye on the literature exam.

It was a question with an excerpt from poet Gilberto's poem "Life is Fallen Leaves."

When asked to explain why the fallen leaves "fall in a zigzag pattern" in the last line, most students submitted answers expressing the fear of death.

But Iruki's answer was this:

- Since the fluid (gas in this case) flowing over the leaf's surface encounters different air resistance at different speeds, it moves in the direction where the sum of force vectors acting on the pressure is greatest.

A formula using the standard model of fallen leaves is attached below.

Below that were incomprehensible strange equations. Teachers who knew Iruki's personality let it pass, but Adelia, the literature teacher, couldn't tolerate it.

A mother of three children, she led her plump body to the classroom and slammed the test paper down in front of Iruki, who was waiting for class, demanding an explanation.

"Iruki! What is this?"

"A test paper."

"Not that! Look at the answer you wrote! This is a literature exam, not a math exam!"

"Isn't the very act of distinguishing between math and literature proof of literature's fictional nature?"

Adelia's chubby face turned red as a roasted pig.

"What do you know to act so pretentious? You're a student. You're still years away from acting like a specialist! There are deep and mysterious thoughts in this world that you can't grasp mathematically."

"Teacher, there's no such thing. If any part of the world were illogical, how could I live without being terrified? My body might turn into an orc right now."

"So you're saying everything is logical? Even poet Gilberto's verses?"

"Of course. That's why I wrote the answer."

Adelia huffed for a long time, then pointed her finger and shouted.

"Then answer this. A thousand innocent people are in mortal danger. But you have the power to save them all by killing one other innocent person. What choice would you make?"

"I'd let the thousand die. A thousand lives are proven, one life is a hypothesis. It's an equation that can't be equated from the start."

Adelia suppressed the indignation rising from her stomach with superhuman effort. If he was going to be like this, she had her own ideas.

"Does God exist or not? Answer!"

"He could not exist."

Adelia became even more venomous.

"Mom and Dad, which do you like better? Answer only one!"

"Modad."

"Get out."

The tip of Adelia's finger pointing to the classroom door trembled.

"Get out, you bastard! Someone like you doesn't even qualify to enter my class! Get out!"

Following Adelia's recommendation, a faculty meeting was held. The teachers ultimately judged that Iruki's problem-solving contained mockery of teaching authority and gave him zero points for all humanities subjects.

"Wow! He really is no joke."

After hearing Iruki's story, Shirone couldn't believe he was an 18-year-old student like himself.

Not only his temperament of confronting teachers, but asserting his own thoughts from a student's position required tremendous boldness.

"Haha! That's right. Anyway, that's his personality. He's really hard to get close to."

"Now that I've heard about it, I can understand why he called me boring with that personality. But why did he say it was a compliment?"

"Who knows. Maybe he saw something extraordinary in you that's different from others. That's why I introduced you on purpose. I thought maybe you two could get along well."

Shirone became curious about this boy called Iruki. He wished he had tried to talk with him a bit more. While thinking this and looking for Iruki, Shirone widened his eyes in surprise.

"Huh? Nade, look over there."

Iruki was facing the Image Zone with a sleepy expression. As he approached, the children naturally moved aside. Rather than avoiding him because they disliked him, it felt more like they were making room for him.

"Damn! What is that guy thinking now? Let's go see."

Shirone followed Nade toward the Image Zone. Besides the two of them, students were gathering one by one.

"Why is that guy doing that again? He's not going to strip naked and lie down like before, is he?"

At someone's words, Shirone's eyes went wide. Stripping naked when there were female students around too.

Contrary to their concerns, Iruki deployed his Spirit Zone normally. A 15-meter diameter sphere. It was on the small side for Class Five.

But the problem wasn't the size. He was freely manipulating the deviation form, said to be the most difficult among the Four-Direction Styles.

"Whoa! Iruki, you haven't done this in a while?"

"Shouldn't we stop him? Teacher Ethella banned him from using the Image Zone."

"Leave him alone. Do you think he'd listen if we tried to stop him?"

The greatly reduced sphere was moving around an incredibly wide radius. Iruki made eye contact with Shirone. Then he snapped his fingers and a target appeared, spinning rapidly around the area.

Students sighed and held their foreheads. Except for permitted cases, raising targets was forbidden. But such thoughts were brief, and they were entranced by the demonstration that followed.

"Wow..."

Iruki's zone pursued the target. Its movements were free and natural, as if the mind had originally left the body. The speed was also impressive—every time the sphere cut through the air, it created the auditory illusion of wind howling.

"Hey? Iruki! What are you doing right now!"

Ethella, who had been instructing Class Four, ran over with a bewildered expression. But Iruki didn't stop his demonstration, as if he had made up his mind. In the center of the Spirit Zone that had swallowed the target, small lights bubbled like foam.

"Atomic Bomb."

"That crazy bastard!"

The moment the children leaned back and away, a powerful explosion burst forth with enough force to push people back. At the deafening roar he'd never heard before in his life, Shirone felt dizzy. All the standing students fell on their backsides.

Shirone looked ahead with a pale expression. Iruki was standing with his hands behind his back, looking at him.

"See you next time, Shirone."
