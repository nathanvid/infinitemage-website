What he meant by "see you later" became clear a little while later when Ethella grabbed him by the ear and dragged him away.

"Iruki! I told you that if you did that one more time, you'd face disciplinary action!"

"Ow, ow, ow, ow! I controlled it so the equipment wouldn't break. You know what happens when I really put my mind to detonating something."

"This boy shows no remorse! You're confined for a week starting today! Don't come to class!"

"Argh! That's too harsh a punishment!"

Iruki cried out but never once admitted he was wrong. He even smiled as he looked back at Shirone and Nade.

"Sigh! In the end, he did it again. Shirone, sorry. I need to go."

Nade left first. Shirone was so captivated by the intense experience that he didn't even notice him leaving. The other students seemed to feel the same way, as countless conversations were breaking out.

"That guy's still amazing, isn't he? The detonation reaction seems to happen faster than before. The explosive power is similar though."

"Well, since he has savant syndrome, he must calculate the reaction formulas perfectly."

Shirone interjected.

"By reaction formula, do you mean the formula that causes the explosion?"

"Yeah. I don't know much about detonation magic either, but they say the explosive power changes depending on how you calculate the reaction formula. It's probably a similar concept to Ignite, which is the foundation of fire magic."

"I see. With that level of explosive power, there'd be no need to learn fire magic."

"No. The application is different from fire magic. First of all, fire magic activates instantly. Even for Iruki, if the firepower gets strong, it'll take quite a while until detonation. Well, reducing that reaction time would be the homework for detonation mages."

If Shirone's insight was specialized for Teleportation, then detonation magic was perfect for Iruki with his superhuman calculation abilities.

The particular advantage of detonation magic was that it could create explosions larger than the Spirit Zone. Magic only triggers the detonation, and the explosion itself is the result. Ultimately, it was magic optimized for separation form, where zones become smaller as distance increases.

'Mercenary Iruki...'

His first impression was certainly as intense as an explosion.

They took their first monthly evaluation since entering Class Five.

Shirone's score averaged 41 points. His rank was still in the lower tier, but he had raised all his subjects by 10 points in just one month.

When class ended, students stretched and organized their desks. Some headed to the school store to fill their hungry stomachs, but most paired off and headed to their research clubs.

Shirone, who didn't belong to a research club, planned to visit the Great Library. While his average score in the 40s wasn't satisfying, it was encouraging that his pace of adding flesh to his spine of knowledge had been accelerating lately.

"Excuse me, Shirone."

A female student approached Shirone. In the corner of the classroom, her friends were watching the interaction with keen interest.

"Yeah. Is there something you wanted to talk about?"

"We discussed it with the others, and would you like to join our research club? We're researching matter transportation magic, and we think the achievement level would be high if you joined. It's also closely related to photon theory."

Since moving up to Class Five, he had received several proposals from groups, but this was the first research club that specifically needed his specialty.

'Hmm. Should I give it a try?'

The school evaluated students on three main criteria:

Practical exams, theoretical exams, and performance assessments.

Performance assessments were assignments done during vacation where you could write and submit a paper on any topic. However, since it could be substituted with a research club presentation, most students preferred to finish it during the semester.

Shirone had once looked into joining a research club to save time, but eventually changed his mind.

Right now they were making offers based on his reputation, but once activities actually started, he wasn't confident he could match their level.

"Hmm, what should I do? I've been studying a particular field lately, but I haven't seen results yet. I'm planning to focus on that for the time being."

"Oh, I see. Then it can't be helped."

"Sorry for refusing when you went out of your way to make the offer."

"Hehe, not at all. What is there to be sorry about? If you ever change your mind, just let us know."

The female student actually showed consideration for Shirone and returned to her friends. In fact, by Class Five level, there weren't many students who acted emotionally. Of course, oddballs like Iruki still existed.

Not long after the female student's group left the classroom, cheerful laughter could be heard from the corridor.

'That looks nice. That looks fun.'

Shirone felt a pang in his heart. He had friends like Rian and Amy too, but Rian was in a different field and Amy was too busy as a graduating student.

They say life is ultimately a lonely battlefield, but attending Class Five without comrades to share it with felt truly melancholy.

"Oh? Shirone, are you leaving now? Let's go together."

Nade wrapped his arm around Shirone's neck from behind. Whenever Shirone was the last one left in the classroom, Nade would invariably come running over.

The two headed toward the dormitory, chatting about various topics. Most of the conversation was about subjects Shirone enjoyed.

"The Great Library is good, but research clubs have quite a few specialized books too. Come to think of it, why did you refuse earlier? That's a pretty decent research club."

"I thought I might not have time."

"True, you need to bring up your theoretical grades first. Still, I'm envious. I don't even have that kind of motivation."

Shirone said with a smile.

"But you have tons of friends. So you could probably join any research club and it would work out fine."

"What are you talking about? Of course I already have a research club. I'm even the president."

"Huh? Really? I had no idea all this time."

Since Nade seemed like he would dislike belonging to any particular group, Shirone had assumed and never even asked. But he was actually a president.

"What kind of research club is it?"

"Haha! Actually, it's too embarrassing to boast about. Including me, there are only 2 people total."

"Huh? Then doesn't that fall short of the minimum requirement? The funding would have been cut too."

The minimum membership requirement for research clubs at the school was 3 or more people. One person was singular, two was plural, but three was when it became a group.

"The seniors graduated last semester. That's how I inherited the presidency too. I'm really worried about it."

"Ah, I see."

While there were numerous research clubs at the school, research clubs with graduating class members were uncommon. Moreover, the fact that they had graduated meant they were among the school's top seniors.

"Would it be okay if I took a look sometime?"

"Really? I thought you weren't interested in research clubs."

"I've been interested all along. But I was worried I might be a burden if I joined, and I felt I should be careful about joining."

"Hahaha! What are you talking about? A research club is just kids studying and hanging out together. There's absolutely no need to feel pressured."

"Hmm, is that so?"

"Actually, I've felt this for a while, but honestly, you can be hard to approach. You know how kids our age play around hitting each other, joking around, and even grabbing each other's... well, you know. There are some losers in Class Five too, but I've gotten to know most of them and there aren't any bad kids. Try to be more comfortable with the others. Of course, I'm not saying you should let them grab your... well. Hahaha!"

It was advice worth taking to heart. Thinking about it, in both Rian and Amy's cases, they were the ones who reached out first.

As Shirone fell into serious contemplation again, Nade, who had been watching, shouted out as if he'd made a decision.

"Alright! I'm in the mood. This is really a special case, but I'll introduce you to our research club. Just promise you won't tease us later for being boring, okay?"

"Really? Then I'd be grateful."

"There you go again. What's this talk of gratitude between friends? Come on, let's go quickly!"

* * *

Shirone followed Nade into a secluded area located northwest of the magic school's central park. About a hundred massive regular tetrahedrons formed a complex colony structure. The material was iron, and magic patterns were carved into the surfaces. Not only was the scale impressive, but the form defied common sense.

"Where is this?"

"It's a warehouse where magical equipment is stored. Our research club is inside the warehouse. Haha!"

Research clubs didn't have designated research rooms. When a research club was established and gathered a certain number of members, the school would provide an empty room.

Even so, a warehouse? At a school boasting such vast grounds, he couldn't understand why they would provide a research room in such a remote location.

"This is like a hideout that our seniors have protected for generations. Our research club actually has quite a deep history. I heard they worked incredibly hard to claim this place."

"But this is a bit..."

"Haha! It's fine. There's nothing we don't have here. They say we can make anything as long as we have the warehouse supplies. Oh, you absolutely can't tell anyone about this. I'm only telling you because I trust you."

"Gasp! Really?"

He had no idea that Nade, who seemed like an ordinary student at school, was illegally using warehouse supplies. In a dazed state, he followed Nade into the building. The structure was as complex as it appeared, with multiple entrances. Moreover, nearly 100 buildings were all connected, making it like navigating a maze.

"Hehe! Cool, right? But there's no need to observe carefully. We change the building structure whenever we have free time."

"You change the building structure? Is that possible?"

"The official name of this place is Magic Warehouse Estas. The building itself is a magical device. Rather than finding and extracting items, it's much faster to move the building and send things to the entrance. It's an engineering design that considers both storage capacity and transportability simultaneously. So on days when the school has practical classes, the structure often changes. That's why no matter what we do, they can't find us."

Nade giggled as he spoke the last words. A hideout that no one could find. Hearing this much, Shirone's heart began to race as well.

"Actually, the method to find the way is simple. But since you're not a member yet, I can't teach you."

Nade walked through the complex paths without a moment's hesitation. After passing through twenty buildings, they arrived at a place painted blue. Each building had roughly ten warehouses of various sizes, and Nade's research club occupied the largest warehouse among them.

"Ta-da! We're here. Right here."

Shirone approached with a tense expression. What kind of research could they be doing to hide away in a place like this?

When they reached the iron door, a crooked research club sign was attached.

- Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club

"Para, paranormal science?"

Among all the fields he had considered, paranormal science wasn't even on the periphery of his thoughts.

"How's that? Our research club is awesome, right? We literally research supernatural phenomena. Ghosts, souls, the afterlife, aliens, hell, gods. Things like that."

Shirone's bewildered expression gradually faded. Thinking about it, these were topics that sparked genuine curiosity.

'The existence of God.'

Throughout history, countless people have invoked God's name, but God has never directly revealed himself to the world.

"Right, this would be interesting. It might not be magical, but it could have research value."

"Haha! Right? I knew it! I thought you'd understand! Come in first. I'll show you around."

Nade grabbed Shirone's hand and opened the door. Contrary to his expectation of a neat philosophical contemplation space, what greeted Shirone was thick dust.

Shirone frowned at the dust bombardment. For this much dust to billow up just from opening a door forcefully wasn't normal.

The warehouse was about 15 pyeong in size. The desk had broken legs, and the table was covered with bread crumbs of unknown age and crumpled papers. They said they had converted the warehouse into a research room, but it seemed all they had converted was the sign.

"It's a bit messy, right? You get used to it as you go along. Come in, come in."

Shirone couldn't understand why he should adapt his eyes to the scenery instead of cleaning the warehouse. But such thoughts disappeared the moment he saw the blackboard hanging at the front.

On the blackboard, tilted crookedly like the sign, equations were written so densely they made him dizzy. It was the work of a boy who was still rapidly moving his chalk.

"Huh?"

Shirone was startled to see the face of the boy who finished writing and turned around. It was Iruki, who hadn't been attending classes for several days due to disciplinary action.
