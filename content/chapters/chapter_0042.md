"Huh? What?"

As Shirone stammered in surprise, Nade smiled awkwardly and explained.

"Haha! Sorry about that. Our research club has a bit of a bad reputation, so it's problematic if we reveal our members."

This was why the eccentric Iruki got along with Nade as a friend. However, the issue was the nature of the research club. It didn't make sense that someone so rational and analytical would be involved in an unscientific research club.

"Iruki was interested in this kind of field?"

"Actually, it's the opposite. He approaches it from a critical standpoint. Iruki believes there's nothing in the world that isn't logical. So where could he find better prey than this?"

Iruki seemed oblivious to Shirone's presence, continuing to mutter something while pacing around. Then he glanced toward Nade and approached with a surprised expression.

"Oh? Shirone!"

Without giving him a chance to respond, Iruki strode over and suddenly grabbed Shirone's shoulders, shaking them as he spoke.

"Perfect timing! I just came up with something incredible! So what I'm saying is, we split the smallest matter. You're thinking, how can you split something that's already the smallest, right? That's exactly my point! If you split it, it's no longer matter! So what could it be? I've been calculating for three days. And surprisingly—oh my goodness!—there's tremendous energy contained inside. What if this were possible? Huh? What do you think would happen? Tell me quickly."

He spoke so rapidly that Shirone couldn't catch the details. But faced with those burning eyes, he felt he had to respond with something.

"Well, I guess? Energy would be released?"

"Exactly! A tremendous explosion! An explosion that could blow away an entire city! You can imagine it, right? Huh? You should be able to imagine it!"

Shirone was dumbfounded. Blow away an entire city? Regardless of whether it was possible, it was a horrifying idea.

"But if that happened, people would die. Everyone living in the city would die."

"What are you talking about? It's an explosion, an explosion! The city would be blown away!"

"That's what I mean! If an explosion goes off, what happens to the people living there?"

"Huh? People living there?"

Iruki tilted his head as if asking what he meant. Shirone finally realized and asked back.

"You... don't tell me you've never thought about it?"

"Of course not. What's important is how much explosive power it can produce. Do I need to think about such things too?"

Shirone felt chilled. He might have understood a little if Iruki had said he didn't care if humans died. But Iruki truly hadn't even considered it.

"How is that possible? How can a mage not think about the consequences of their magic?"

"You're speaking foolishly, Shirone. That's something for anthropologists to think about. It's a genius's duty to push what they can do to the very limit."

"If being a genius means inevitably harming someone, then being a fool is much better."

"A few geniuses feed the many fools. History proves it. It's also the reality we belong to. Shirone, I really hate it when people bring up idealism."

"No, your logic is the one steeped in defeatism. Ideals can definitely be realized!"

"They're called ideals because they're ideals."

As Shirone and Iruki growled at each other like enemies, Nade intervened with an awkward smile.

"Now, now! Let's stop this. Debate is good, but conflict isn't. Let's sit down calmly and talk about this matter."

"No. I have nothing to say. Nade, I'm leaving!"

Shirone spun around and left the research club. Nade hurriedly chased after him, shouting.

"Shirone! We should go together! How will you find your way alone?"

"Leave me alone. It's not like the structure has changed. I should remember the way I came, at least. If I can't even do that, then I really am a fool."

By the time he went outside, Shirone was already out of sight. Nade returned with a frown.

"Why did you act like that? You could have spoken in a way that would convince him."

"Well, I don't really know either. Maybe it's because we're rivals. One of the two has to fall."

It was extremely rare for the word "rival" to come from Iruki's mouth. His arrogant personality played a part, but more than that, he was a child who had no interest in competition itself.

Women, wealth, honor—none of these could move him. The only thing he was absorbed in was equations.

"Shirone is your rival? Are you serious about that?"

Iruki sat on the sofa. As his bottom sank in, dust rose up in wisps.

"You saw it too, didn't you? The Teleportation test. The Unbridgeable Bridge."

"I saw it. That's why he became our classmate."

"How fast would someone who's learning Teleportation for the first time have to think to escape the dragon's maze at level 10?"

Iruki tapped his head as he spoke.

"According to my calculations, the unit of time Shirone split in that instant moment was at least 1/10,000th of a second."

"1/10,000th of a second..."

Nade felt dizzy. Just thinking about that numerical gap in time made his head feel like it would burst.

Iruki laughed with a metallic giggle.

"That's truly the mystery of insight. Faster than effort and more accurate than knowledge. No conscious calculating ability would be faster than the speed of intuition. But you know, Nade."

Madness swirled in Iruki's pupils.

"I wonder... what about me?"

"..."

Shirone's insight versus Iruki's calculating ability. Which would be faster? Thinking about a collision between the two, Nade swallowed nervously, feeling an eerie thrill.

**Limitless (1)**

Called by Siena, Shirone went to the faculty office. She, who had been reading a book, led Shirone to the teachers' lounge and offered him tea.

"Here, since you treated me last time, this time I should treat you."

"Haha! Thank you."

Since moving up to Class Five, Shirone's social skills had improved considerably. Recently, he'd been heard making jokes frequently with his classmates.

"So what did you call me for?"

"I saw your report card. You're maintaining your growth trajectory. It's particularly encouraging that your chemistry score, which I teach, is the highest."

"Hehe, but it's only a 1-point difference."

Even Siena, his dedicated teacher, hadn't predicted that Shirone would maintain his upward trend for so long. Running in the mid-40s average while keeping the deviation within 2 points per subject meant he could continue improving for the time being.

"At this rate, you should be able to settle into the upper-middle tier starting next month. When that happens, the school will start paying attention to your study methods too."

"Well, I wasn't particularly trying to get attention."

"Of course, I know that. So the reason I called you today is to make a proposal."

"A proposal?"

"You know there's a practical exam every two months, right? This month there's a targeting test. Do you know what that is?"

"Yes. I saw it when Amy was in Class Four. It's a test where you hit targets within a time limit, right? Amy was especially fast since she's target-form. She was really cool."

Siena smiled, watching Shirone's eyes sparkle.

"Right. Amy seems to be doing well in the graduating class. You must miss being apart from your girlfriend."

The advanced class and graduating class had different curricula, making it difficult to meet. They could date on weekends, but they weren't actually in a relationship, and even that was hard to find time for.

"It's fine as long as I know she's working hard. As her boyfriend, I should cheer her on."

There were probably few couples who dated as wholesomely as Shirone and Amy. If they continued like this, the school would want to encourage romance.

"Right. Let me end the introduction here—the reason I called you today is because of the practical exam. Do you have any magic you've learned besides Teleportation?"

"No. As you can see from my grades, I still don't meet the standards... Oh! I see!"

Shirone realized belatedly. To take a practical exam, you needed to be able to use active magic. It didn't necessarily have to be attack magic, but Teleportation, the only magic Shirone had learned, was passive magic with lasting effects.

In contrast, active magic had instantaneous effects, with various types like Fire, Wind Cutter, Healing, Ice Sword, Lightning Bolt, and Atomic Bomb.

Wouldn't he need at least one magic that could hit targets to take the test? Shirone was in a bind.

"What should I do? I was so focused on studying that I didn't even think about it."

"Don't worry. Someone who has mastered Rainbow Drop should be able to handle simple active magic."

"But my theoretical exam average is 45 points. You said activation would be difficult without at least 60 points."

"That's right. But there's one thing, isn't there? Something close to 100 points."

Among all the theoretical exams he'd taken so far, there wasn't a single subject where he'd scored over 50 points, let alone 100. But Shirone immediately realized what she meant. As Siena said, there was definitely one thing left.

"Ah! Photon theory!"

"Right. Teleportation is a practical evaluation, so I overlooked it, but since you've studied photon theory sufficiently, it should be possible to apply it to active magic."

"I see! Thank you, teacher."

"It's natural advice for a dedicated teacher to give. No need to thank me particularly. If you have any difficulties in the future, come for consultation anytime."

"Yes. Then I'll consult right away. What kind of active magic can be developed from photon theory?"

Siena smiled as if she'd expected this.

"Have you ever heard of photon output?"

"I read about it in books. It's shooting photons, right?"

It was a phenomenon called 'photon emission.' However, since there was no physical force, shooting them didn't particularly cause anything to happen. You could use it to illuminate your surroundings if you got lost in the mountains, but it would be much more convenient to cast an illumination spell instead. Even the great discovery called photon theory was starkly divided in efficiency between active and passive applications.

However, the ivory towers leading the advancement of current magical society held the view that photon output was the future of magic. Nothing is faster than light. Moreover, using the properties of direct projection could lead to innovation in the information field.

Based on these latest trends, Siena persuaded Shirone.

"The future of photon output can be said to be bright. By the time you graduate, there might already be some initial results. It wouldn't be bad to learn it in advance."

"Yes. Then I'll practice it."

Shirone answered without hesitation that he would do so.

Since active magic was needed to take the practical evaluation anyway, and photon output was the only thing he could master immediately.

After finishing the consultation, Shirone headed to the training ground. With little time left before the exam, even starting practice now would be cutting it close.

Shirone extended his hand and concentrated. Since magic was a phenomenon that occurred in the Spirit Zone, there was no need to perform any particular action, but strengthening consciousness through action had the effect of increasing concentration. Mages called this 'magical action.'

He activated magic in a photonized state, but the emission phenomenon didn't occur. Just as Teleportation was easy for defensive types, photon output was magic specialized for offensive types.

'It requires much higher concentration than when using Teleportation.'

Shirone attempted dozens of times before failing and slumping to the floor. While passive magic depended on how strongly you could maintain your mind, active magic required instantaneous mental compression.

The Spirit Zone didn't actually shrink, but you got the feeling of applying tremendous pressure to squeeze it. However, the Spirit Zone's durability was so strong that it wasn't easy to get the hang of it.

'This is why disposition is really important.'

Ethella had mentioned in passing that there were technical ways to strengthen the Spirit Zone, but since he had just enrolled at the time, he hadn't heard the detailed lessons.

'The Spirit Zone is an extremely sensitive mental state. It's said to be the limit of concentration, but how do you strengthen it further from here?'

Carrying only these various questions, Shirone trudged back to his dormitory.
