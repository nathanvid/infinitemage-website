Shirone headed to the integrated class training ground early in the morning. Since today marked the beginning of exam preparation education, the lessons proceeded in a more tense atmosphere than usual.

The exam subjects varied by class. Class Five, which Shirone belonged to, would take the targeting exam, commonly known as Speed Gun.

"Ugh! Starting today, we'll be doing nothing but Speed Gun until we drop dead. It's the subject I'm least confident in. Those specialized in target form have it good. They have a huge advantage."

"Not necessarily. Target form is advantageous when dealing with small elite groups. But the practical evaluation targets come pouring out in huge numbers. Maybe it'd be better to switch to offensive form and just blow up whatever comes our way?"

"You'd get exhausted first doing that. Anyway, it'll have to be either offensive form or target form. No one would ever use separation form. How could you possibly keep up with all those targets?"

"Come to think of it, what about Iruki? Isn't he going to use separation form again this time?"

"Haha! No way, unless he's an idiot. I'm curious about Shirone too. He's strong in actual combat. But since he specializes in defensive form, we'll have to see what choice he makes."

Iruki and Shirone's names were frequently mentioned in the students' conversations. While there were students with better grades than them, the expectation that these two would show something special at crucial moments was overwhelming.

But Shirone wanted to cry. Far from being strong in actual combat, he hadn't even succeeded in photon output yet. If he couldn't activate offensive magic, he would naturally receive zero points on the practical exam.

'Ugh! What should I do? This is really troubling.'

While Shirone was lost in thought, the sound of a dog barking came from outside the training ground. The female students showed interest first, and the male students ran over.

"What? How did it get in?"

"Must be a dog from the mountains. But why is it barking like that?"

As the children gathered around, the dog's wariness intensified. It was baring its teeth and growling.

Generally, people think of dogs as creatures that wag their tails when they see humans. But when they showed aggression instead, it couldn't help but feel unpleasant, even if it was just a dog.

"Hey! Get lost! How annoying!"

The Class Seven students threw stones at it. Students from higher classes were also watching, but no one stopped them. They thought that since it disliked humans, it was no different from a wild beast.

But Shirone was different. After listening to the dog's barking for quite some time, he realized something and ran over.

"Wait! Don't throw stones."

Although he had been a Class Seven classmate until recently, he was now clearly their senior, so the children stopped their actions with tense expressions. Mark, the leader of Class Seven, organized the situation.

"Hey, hey! Stop it! Senior Shirone is telling you to stop!"

Shirone approached closely to examine the situation more carefully. Then Mark followed him in with a startled expression.

"Senior, it's dangerous. This is a wild dog."

"No matter how wild they grew up, dogs don't bite people. They'd rather run away."

"But it's barking like that."

"I think maybe..."

Shirone approached fearlessly. The dog growled with a terrifying low rumble, but couldn't bring itself to attack.

Shirone looked straight into the dog's eyes and pushed through to the forest. As expected, a young puppy that wasn't fully grown yet was lying in the grass, whimpering.

"You hurt your leg. Poor thing."

"Oh? It's true. Guys, there's a puppy here, a puppy."

"Don't call them yet. No matter how tame a dog is, you never know how it might change when its pup is in danger."

"Ah, I see. Hey! Don't come over, don't come over!"

"Instead, could you find someone who can use healing magic? It would be great if Senior Seriel could come, but just find someone from Class Five or below."

"There's no need for that. Maria knows how to do it."

Maria, who had attended the school since childhood, could use various types of magic. Moreover, since meeting Thad, she had gained peace of mind and got along well with her classmates, so when Mark called her, she immediately ran over.

"Oh my goodness! How did it get hurt like this?"

"Probably got caught up in territorial fighting and was bitten. Can you heal it?"

"Yes, Senior. This much is simple."

When Maria cast healing magic, the puppy's wounds closed. Having regained its health, the puppy bounced around the grass as lively as ever, as if nothing had happened. The mother dog finally stopped barking and took her pup back into the mountains.

Saving a life was always a heartwarming thing. Even the children who had thrown stones were moved as they gazed at the forest for a long time.

"Amazing, Senior. How did you know there was a puppy?"

"Hm? Haha! I lived in the mountains for a long time before."

Shirone recalled an incident from when he was about eleven, when he went hunting with his father.

That day, luck was particularly good, and a red bear—valuable down to its claws—was caught struggling in a rope trap. Since a red bear's strength could break the rope, Vincent hurriedly aimed his arrow.

Shirone waited with an anxious heart. If they caught the red bear, they wouldn't have to worry about meals for a while.

But the arrow showed no signs of being released. Turning his head at the strange thought, he saw Vincent putting away his bow and preparing to leave.

"Well, I'll be. They say too much good luck isn't good either. Let's just go back, Shirone."

"Huh? Why aren't you catching it? Mom would be really happy."

Vincent crouched down and pointed to where the bear was caught.

"Look over there, Shirone."

Shirone looked carefully. He saw a bear cub whimpering next to its trapped mother.

"No matter how much of a hunter one is, you don't catch animals when they have young. Though they're animals, the love for their children is the same whether human or beast."

"But then we're returning empty-handed. There's an amazing catch right there."

Vincent stroked Shirone with warm eyes.

"Just as that bear has a cub, I have you. As a fellow parent, how could I pretend not to notice? Fighting to survive is the same for humans and beasts alike. But you shouldn't do it in front of your children. That's an unwritten rule that applies to all living things."

Shirone felt Vincent's compassion that day. Perhaps he didn't save the bear—maybe he protected his own child. The conviction that his father would always protect him warmed Shirone's heart.

The students were moved by the story Shirone told. Though they didn't know it was about Shirone's father, the magnitude of their emotion was no different.

"I see. Shirone is really wonderful."

"Right. Shirone is so caring."

His classmates began to see Shirone differently. It was an unexpected charm to discover that someone they thought was rigid and only knew magic had such a warm heart.

"A foolish theory. Hunters don't spare beasts for such reasons."

At these words that poured cold water on the warm atmosphere, the children glared behind them. Iruki was looking at Shirone with his hands behind his back.

"The reason hunters don't kill beasts with young is to prevent those young from growing up and developing aggression toward humans later. In biology, this is called the imprinting effect. Once they recognize humans as natural enemies, their offspring inherit that instinct too. Then hunting becomes difficult. But if you kill the young too, the species will die out. You could call it the wisdom of hunters who can only hunt in their own territory."

Shirone was indignant. Of course, Iruki said it without knowing, but his statement was an insult to his father's compassion.

"How can you say that? Of course there might be hunters like that. But most hunters really do release beasts out of pity."

"Heart. Emotions. These things are just a matter of packaging. I'm talking about reality. I don't deceive people with foolish idealism like you do."

"What! Are you done talking?"

Shirone jumped up and glared at Iruki. It was round two of the argument that had occurred in the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club.

The students were dumbfounded. Shirone wasn't the type to fight with anyone, and Iruki didn't get along with anyone. When these two clashed, the tension increased several times over.

"What's going on? Did those two have some kind of issue? It's like they've been fighting since way back."

"They're keeping each other in check. Anyway, those two are definitely among the candidates for the next promotion."

Shirone glared with intensity in his eyes. On the other hand, Iruki seemed to have no intention of fighting as he looked around elsewhere and did other things.

"Hey, hey! Why are you two at it again? You were quiet for a while. The teacher's coming, so let's go back for now."

Thanks to Nade breaking them up, it didn't escalate into a big fight, but Shirone couldn't help feeling unpleasant.

He couldn't understand Iruki's way of thinking. Whether it was researching equations to blow up cities or his attitude of treating animal life as trivial—he didn't like any aspect of it.

'Ugh, I shouldn't deal with him anymore.'

Class began and Ethella came up the mountain. The students stared blankly with their mouths open at her unusual appearance.

Was it because it was the practical evaluation period? She was wearing training clothes that were short-sleeved and revealed her thighs for easy movement.

Most shocking of all was that she wasn't wearing glasses.

The male students were speechless at the beautiful woman standing before them. Could one pair of glasses really change someone's impression this much?

"You know there's special education starting today, right? Due to training ground circumstances, Class Five's Speed Gun test will be held first. Starting tomorrow, the time slots will be divided by class, so please take note. Today's lesson will proceed after watching the teaching assistant's demonstration. Samuel, this way."

A tall, handsome blonde man walked forward in front of the students. He appeared to be in his early twenties and unusually for a man, had grown his hair down to his waist.

"The teaching assistant standing here is Samuel, who is preparing for graduation in the graduating class. His major is incantation magic, and he came specially today to demonstrate magic. Since this is also related to Spirit Zone enhancement education, please pay close attention."

Waaaaaaah!

The female students enthusiastically welcomed Samuel. Having their eyes feast only on men during integrated class time, they couldn't hide their excitement when a handsome man appeared.

"Nice to meet you. It feels like just yesterday I was taking classes in the advanced section, but time has already passed like this. Though my skills are nothing special, I'll do my best with the hope of contributing to your education."

Shirone looked at Samuel with interest.

It was an opportunity to see what kind of skills the graduating class rival who was competing with Amy possessed. He was especially curious about the unfamiliar major of incantation magic.

Samuel entered his Image Zone and deployed his Spirit Zone. That alone made the students exclaim in admiration. A sphere with a 42-meter diameter, similar in size to Shirone's, surrounded him.

"Incantation magic is strengthening magical power through the power of language. Then I'll first cast Tornado without using incantations. Tornado."

When Samuel raised both hands, a powerful whirlwind swept through. There were students in the advanced class who could use Tornado. But he cast it as easily as handling basic magic.

"Please remember the power from just now. This time I'll strengthen Tornado with incantation magic. It's literally using the power of language. By savoring the will contained in words, a mage's mental strength becomes stronger."

Samuel cleared his throat and began reciting a poem composed of eight verses.

"O land of fervor, I borrow your strength, caress with your hands. The sky looks down and ten thousand years of history are contained in an instant. When the power of emptiness dwells in my hands..."

Before even one verse was finished, the children's expressions became lukewarm. Since he was reciting a strange poem with ambiguous meaning, boredom crept in. The sound of yawning could be heard from somewhere, but Samuel didn't seem displeased and finished the poem. Then he raised both hands again and cast the magic.

"Tornado."

Whoooooosh!

With a tremendous roar, a massive whirlwind shot up to the sky, and the children froze while being hit by winds strong enough to take their breath away. The wind was so powerful that Samuel's figure wavered like a mirage.

Samuel smiled and said, "This is the power of incantation. Language contains a mage's will. By savoring that will, magic is strengthened. Speak and reflect upon it. This is the basic system of incantation magic. Now let's do it in earnest."
