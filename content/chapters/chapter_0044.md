The students' expressions became bewildered. Just from the demonstration they had witnessed, they could fully feel the power of incantation magic. But this was only the beginning?

Samuel began reciting the same verse again. As the speed of his words gradually increased, the children showed interest.

"O land of passion, I borrow your strength to caress my hands. The sky looks down and the history of eternity is contained in a moment."

But this was merely the start.

His lip movements began to leave afterimages, and eventually the syllables connected so rapidly that it was impossible to tell what he was saying.

*(The sanctuary of heaven exists in the heart, and the spellcaster's will is contained in the world. I shall sing songs of praise and glory. Only pale lightning can ignite fire, and hot winds summon typhoons.)*

Samuel clutched his lungs and grimaced. The handsome young man who had calmly recited verses disappeared, leaving only a combative incantation mage.

The speed of the incantation reached its limit.

*(O soul dwelling in the mind, call our names. The mage fears not the power of lions. Like the sea that holds the sun, like the earth that holds the sea, like the wind that holds the earth, the wind of eons is in my hands, achieving infinite intellect.)*

As all sounds rushed forward, sound clashed with sound, producing high-frequency squeals. The students all covered their ears in unison. It was as if dozens of dolphins were crying out together.

Now the incantation transcended the realm of language and became waves of sound. Samuel's lips remained open but motionless, with only his tongue vibrating at tremendous speed inside.

Shirone was stunned. It was more than twenty times faster than normal pronunciation speed. Samuel, who had completed the incantation that initially took over 2 minutes in just 6 seconds, cast Tornado again. With a booming sound, a whirlwind clothed in dust shot upward.

When the dust settled, Samuel was smiling comfortably. The sound like breaking metal had disappeared, but ringing still echoed in the students' ears.

"This is what's called supersonic technique, the foundation of incantation mages. It's an indispensable skill in actual combat situations. Of course, it's not just about speaking fast. Though it may have sounded like harsh noise to you, I contemplated the meaning of every verse without omission. I believe the power of the Tornado is sufficient proof of that."

The students were speechless with amazement. They hadn't expected incantation magic to be this powerful. The final Tornado in particular showed nearly ten times the amplification of the initial spell.

*'Is this graduating class level?'*

Shirone broke out in cold sweat. Of course, since Teacher Ethella had called him as an assistant, he must be among the top ranks even within the graduating class.

But he was still a student. And thinking that Amy was competing for rankings with people like this made his desire to enter the graduating class even stronger.

The other students seemed quite stimulated as well, their faces flushed. This was why Ethella had deliberately called a senior to demonstrate.

"Thank you for your hard work, Samuel. Thanks to you, the students have seen and felt a great deal. Thank you for granting my difficult request."

Samuel bowed his head with a serious attitude that showed not the slightest hint of romantic longing between man and woman.

"Not at all. Just call me anytime and I'll come."

Shirone suddenly realized who he was receiving lessons from. Even Samuel, upon graduation, would only be an unofficial 10th-class mage. But the young female teacher before his eyes was a 6th-class, and a state-certified mage at that.

*'Just how strong is our teacher?'*

The other students seemed to realize this fact as well, maintaining reverent postures without losing composure even after Samuel left.

"Now then, everyone. Did you get a good look at the incantation magic demonstration?"

"Yes!"

As their response rang out more vigorously than usual, Ethella nodded with a satisfied expression.

"The reason I showed you incantation magic first is because it's closely related to the Spirit Zone enhancement we'll learn today. Now you should be able to answer this question. What's the best way to strengthen thoughts?"

The students answered in unison.

"Words!"

"That's right. Words. Because thoughts are made of language. Can anyone express this differently?"

Students from Class Four, who had been receiving lessons from Ethella for a long time, answered.

"It means we can see our thoughts."

"Exactly. Everyone, try thinking of any thought right now. You'll probably be able to see that thought with your eyes."

Students who tried it nodded as if they understood the feeling.

"Why is it important to see thoughts with your eyes? Because it makes reflection possible. In other words, incantation mages reabsorb the language they speak to strengthen their thoughts."

Ethella raised her index finger and continued her explanation.

"The basic system of incantation is simple. Speak and reflect. Speak and reflect. This way, they continuously amplify meaning to strengthen their magical power."

"Teacher, will we also learn incantation?"

When a question came from Class Seven, Ethella smiled.

"Do you want to learn incantation magic?"

"Yes. That guy earlier was really cool."

"I see. Finding what suits your aptitude is very important. But unfortunately, incantation magic is a specialized department, so it won't be covered in advanced classes."

"But then how do we strengthen Spirit Zone? Wasn't it supposed to be done with incantation?"

"You've made an excellent point. What I'm about to tell you is exactly that. Incantation is used to increase the power of specific magic. There are countless magic spells in the world, and each has its own language of expression. But Spirit Zone is pure mental operation, so there's no need to learn incantation or supersonic technique. So what's the method for strengthening Spirit Zone?"

Ethella paused her explanation and rose to Image Zone.

"It's a unique concentration method called sequence formula. How many of you have experience counting from 1 to 100, whether in your thoughts or aloud? Please raise your hands."

More than half raised their hands.

"Good. Then how many have counted from 1 to 1,000?"

Students craned their necks and looked around. All of Class Four raised their hands, but hardly any could be seen among the lower class students.

"Sequence formula is literally the technique of arranging numbers. Unlike language, numbers are symbols with fixed and immutable status. Therefore, they match well with Spirit Zone."

"Does counting numbers increase concentration?"

"That's right. But you can't just count simply. Basically, it's the same as incantation. Speak and reflect. However, in the case of sequence formula, it becomes think and reflect. Without concentrating on each individual number, sequence formula cannot succeed."

This was why Ethella introduced incantation magic first. While it becomes completely different at advanced levels, the basic concept of enhancement was nearly identical between sequence formula and incantation.

"The faster you expand numbers, the stronger your Zone becomes. Performing sequence formula can increase all aspects including activation probability, power, and precision. But remember that sequence formula isn't omnipotent. Spirit Zone can only be elevated through rigorous mental cultivation. So don't lean too heavily toward technical enhancement. Now I'll demonstrate the sequence formula directly."

Having finished her explanation, Ethella deployed a Spirit Zone about 10 meters in diameter, necessary for teaching.

"I'll now perform the sequence formula. I'll strengthen the currently visible Spirit Zone using only sequence formula. Since it's not incantation, I'll only announce every power of 10, considering syllables. Let's begin. 1."

From the moment Ethella spoke "1," the beginning of the sequence formula, Spirit Zone swelled as if air were filling it.

"100."

"100? Did you just say 100?"

For sequence formula to be effective, each number must be precisely savored. Yet counting to 100 in 2 seconds was a terrifying speed.

"400."

The children's eyes widened. As acceleration began, the zero-to-hundred time representing speed over specific intervals became incredibly short.

"1,100. 1,700. 2,400."

Shirone's jaw dropped. Could a human count numbers that fast? In less than 20 seconds, she had added 1 a full 2,400 times.

Spirit Zone had grown to a sphere 40 meters in diameter. It was a size created purely through sequence formula.

When the numbers hit 10,000, Ethella stopped the sequence formula. Spirit Zone rapidly shrank back to its original size.

The concentration to count 10,000 in one go proved why she was the youngest bishop of the Carsis Order.

*'Really amazing. How much mental training would it take to reach such a level?'*

Students experiencing Ethella's sequence formula demonstration for the first time were shocked. Even her beautiful appearance seemed to pale compared to her talent.

"Did you see that well? The scope of enhancement grows according to how fast you can perform sequence formula. Since it's merely technique, you can't achieve great efficiency if your Spirit Zone practice itself is lacking, but I think you'll all be able to use it effectively."

Shirone rejoiced upon hearing her words. Using sequence formula, he could employ active magic through mental condensation stronger than Spirit Zone's durability.

"Sequence formula is based on 1 to 100. We call the time it takes to reach this zero-to-hundred. Until you get used to it, don't drag out the numbers too long and focus on shortening your zero-to-hundred time."

When class ended, Shirone found a secluded spot. The sequence formula he actually tried was simple yet difficult.

Checking the time it took from 1 to 100, it was 7 seconds. For a first attempt, it was a decent result.

What made him happiest was that despite calculating at tremendous speed, he had reached the end without breaking off even once.

Though Class Five's level was quite high, this was proof that Shirone still excelled in mental endurance.

In reality, most students performing sequence formula for the first time lost concentration as acceleration increased.

*'Counting itself isn't a problem. Should I try increasing the numbers? No, she said to focus on shortening zero-to-hundred first.'*

Given Ethella's personality, the sequence formula level would be precisely matched to the students' standards.

*'Then there must be much higher levels. What could that be? There must be special methods.'*

Lost in thought, Shirone snapped his fingers.

*'There's no need to calculate one by one. Rather, I should process them while savoring numbers as wholes.'*

Though Shirone didn't know it, this was the basic concept of information magic called modularization. It was a method of bundling individual numbers by units and processing them at once.

Shirone immediately began experimenting. To integrate numbers required insight rather than calculation. As the number of digits processed within the same time increased, he clearly felt Spirit Zone's performance rising.

Having broken through zero-to-hundred at tremendous speed, Shirone switched his Four-Direction Style to offensive form. And the moment sequence formula reached one thousand, he performed magical action and cast magic.

With a flash of light, students turned to look at Shirone. A photon mass shot out from Shirone's palm.

Strictly speaking, it was a sphere of light, but due to its near-light-speed velocity, it appeared to people's eyes as if a single flash of lightning was racing.

"Whoa! What's that?"

"It's photon output. He must be practicing for the targeting exam."

"But why did he learn that? Photon output would be useless in actual combat."

"Doesn't matter. Image Zone targets activate with any magic. Even using healing removes the target. Actually, it might be advantageous for exams. Honestly, that thing's incredibly fast, right?"

Even without physical force, there was no active magic faster than photon output among the basics, making it perfect for hitting targets that flew around like flies.
