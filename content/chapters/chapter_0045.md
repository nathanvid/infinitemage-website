Ethella followed the murmuring sounds to where Shirone was located. Light was continuously emanating from Shirone's hands.

"Shirone, it looks like you're preparing well."

"Yes. Actually, I just succeeded."

"Hehe. Really? It seems the sequence formula was effective."

"It appears so."

Shirone focused on photon output again, apparently having many errors to correct. Ethella touched her lips thoughtfully as she observed carefully. She had actually expected that active magic would be quite difficult for Shirone, since his inclination was too focused on the defensive form.

'Yet the fact that he succeeded...'

It meant he had incorporated modularization. She had planned to give advice during individual instruction time, but since he realized it on his own, there was no opportunity to step in. Instead, she made a suggestion.

"Shirone, you've never tried hitting targets, have you? Would you like to go up to the Image Zone?"

"Yes, I'll give it a try."

The students stopped practicing and looked at Shirone. How many points he could score was a major concern for his competitors.

Shirone waited for the targets to rise. Though it was just practice, this was his first Speed Gun training, so he was as nervous as if it were real combat.

Ethella activated the magic barrier device to prepare for any possible accidents. Like Iruki before, casting magic without a magical barrier could damage not only equipment but also students.

When the signal dropped, targets rose from all directions. Shirone deployed his sequence formula while converting the Four-Direction Style to offensive form. Countless thorns extended in all directions. Quite a few targets were captured in a single attempt.

Shirone cast photon output without delay. The moment light flashed, the targets turned to ash and disappeared.

"Woooah..."

The children burst into exclamations. Though it was an active magic without physical force, it was overwhelming in its splendor.

'Not bad?'

Shirone cast photon output continuously. The targets disappeared simultaneously with casting the magic. The absence of time delay caused by distance was a tremendous advantage.

'I can do this!'

Gaining confidence, Shirone shot photons in all directions. As his thoughts aligned perfectly, he began to desire a good record as well.

The current number of eliminated targets was 172. With 20 seconds still remaining, breaking through to 200 points would be easily achievable.

'He's definitely mastered modularization.'

Ethella was convinced after watching the demonstration. The insight gained from the Unbridgeable Bridge leading to the sequence formula was a positive development.

Shirone's current sequence formula had 10 numbers forming one unit, rising all at once. At this level, it was a speed that could cover zero to one hundred in 2 seconds.

After a minute passed and the device stopped operating, Shirone came down from the Image Zone, panting. The students' gazes focused on the electronic scoreboard. Final total: 342 points. It meant he had eliminated 342 targets in one minute.

"How did he not miss even once? Should I take the test with photon output too?"

"Does that look easy to you? Only Shirone, who mastered Teleportation, can do photon output."

Students shared various impressions. Nade and Iruki also sat beside them, discussing their observations.

"That's our Shirone. He's specialized in defensive form, yet his offensive form is incredible too. Maybe he can charge into the leading group through this test."

"I'm not sure about that. 342 points isn't much, is it?"

"Still, it's a decent score for a first attempt. He couldn't even do photon output until yesterday."

"Whether it's the first time or not isn't important. What's really important is the ability to grasp the core, isn't it? That's what should be praised."

"Huh? What's this? You're praising Shirone?"

"I have to acknowledge what should be acknowledged. Anyway, it'll be a good experiment. We can confirm who's superior in this test."

"What are you planning?"

Instead of answering, Iruki got up and walked to the Image Zone.

"Teacher Ethella, may I try as well?"

"Iruki, you?"

Ethella asked uneasily. Considering what happened before, she didn't know what accident this child might cause if she carelessly let him demonstrate.

"I'll just practice and come down. The magic barrier is already activated anyway."

Since it was the test preparation period, restricting specific students would be a matter of fairness. She had no choice but to consent.

"Fine. Go up. But don't cause any accidents."

Iruki bowed his head and entered the Image Zone. The students' attention focused on his appearance. After finishing preparations, Iruki converted the Four-Direction Style to separation form. The children murmured. They never expected him to use separation form even in the targeting test.

Shirone was equally surprised. Though separation form showed the fastest movement among the Four-Direction Styles, to capture targets coming in rapid succession, one needed at least offensive form to raise scores. Separation form required abandoning synesthesia and tracking targets only with the eyes. Perfect one-to-one correspondence. To use an analogy, it was a method of moving a point to catch a point.

'What exactly is he planning?'

As targets rose, Iruki's Spirit Zone began to move. It had shrunk to about the size of a human face. On the other hand, its speed had increased even more.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

It was precise. Like rubber with elasticity, the Spirit Zone sharply changed angles while eliminating targets. It was natural for students to be amazed. Even Ethella couldn't hide her surprise.

'Eliminating targets with separation form. Quite a unique method.'

The count was already exceeding 100 points. Shirone realized what amazing skill Iruki was displaying. He was eliminating targets while watching them with his eyes. Considering the movement speed, it was tremendous dynamic vision.

'No, it's not at that level.'

The marvelous calculation ability of savant syndrome. He was predicting the targets' movement direction and positioning the Spirit Zone in advance.

'It would be troublesome if you're surprised by just this, Shirone.'

The moment Iruki's lips curved up, the Spirit Zone moved at a speed of a completely different dimension than before.

"Huh? Huh?"

The students were shocked. They couldn't follow the Spirit Zone's movement with their eyes. Every time something blurry bounced through space, targets were exploding from all directions.

Popopopopopopop!

Thanks to minimizing the power of Atomic Bomb, the time required for detonation reaction was almost nonexistent. While Shirone's photon output suppressed the range with high speed, he was moving the Spirit Zone to strike directly.

The count broke through 200 points. It was faster than Shirone using modularization. If the visible results showed this, Shirone could acknowledge it. However, he still wondered by what method the zone was strengthened.

"Don't tell me he used the same method I did?"

"No. It'll be different from yours."

Nade had approached and was sitting beside him.

"Iruki thinks of you as a rival. It would be meaningless if he didn't win with savant syndrome. Ultimately, it's tremendously fast calculation ability. Probably the numbers Iruki is currently counting aren't in units of 1,000."

"Not units of 1,000? Then?"

"One million."

Shirone's eyes widened. Was it possible to count to one million within a minute? This was a different matter from feeling one ten-thousandth of a second. Modularization of numbers was possible because it was in the realm of intuition. However, work requiring repetition of one million routines left no room for imagination.

Iruki used the given one minute and came down. His final score was 548 points, greatly exceeding Shirone's score.

Students began murmuring. This was the first time Iruki had approached class so seriously.

"Amazing. 548 points with separation form. That's not human."

"He calculated all the targets' equations of motion with savant ability. Honestly, isn't that too much?"

Ethella also viewed Iruki differently. Capturing targets with separation form could be called the result of mathematical calculation. However, the Spirit Zone's movement speed couldn't be explained by that alone.

'Could it be? That child...'

Iruki came down from the Image Zone and went straight to Shirone. Then, winking mischievously, he said:

"How was the impression? Was it reasonably worth watching?"

Shirone had no choice but to acknowledge it.

"It was an amazing demonstration. Savant syndrome. I really didn't know you could mathematically calculate the targets' movement paths."

"Hmm, is that all? This is disappointing."

"What?"

Shirone replied sulkily. Even when praised, he wore an expression of dissatisfaction, which hurt his feelings. However, Iruki continued without caring.

"Bundling numbers into modules to increase the sequence formula's speed. It's certainly a method only you can do."

Shirone was surprised that Iruki already knew. And he was anxious. Meanwhile, he couldn't even guess what method Iruki had used.

"Shall I teach you the method I tried?"

Shirone's pride was hurt.

"Is it okay to tell me so casually? From what I heard, you seem to be quite wary of me."

"It doesn't matter. Knowing doesn't mean you can do it."

As expected, Iruki was someone who really got under people's skin.

"Actually, it's nothing special. I just used logarithms to reduce the units."

"Logarithms...? Ah, I see."

Indeed, such a method existed. Also, as Iruki said, it wasn't a method one could follow just by knowing it.

"If you apply logs, even astronomical numbers can be expressed simply. This time I did it for practice. The real match is the practical evaluation anyway."

Applying logs makes it possible to express numbers of any magnitude simply. One hundred million, one billion, ten billion - all the same.

However, logs were originally symbols created to simplify complex calculations. Therefore, when applied to simple operations like sequence formulas, they become so complex that even mathematicians cannot perform mental calculations.

But Iruki was capable. With savant syndrome's ability, he converted all natural numbers to fractions and calculated them.

'Sequence formulas with logs applied? Is that really humanly possible?'

For the first time, Shirone felt he had thought too lightly of things. Carmis Amy. Members of the Ozent family. He had met quite a few geniuses in his life, but this was his first encounter with someone whose talent was as extremely tilted as Iruki's.

"How about it? Can you still beat me like this?"

"I don't study to beat someone. If I do my best, it doesn't matter who wins."

"A textbook answer. It doesn't matter. I can just think you were always that kind of guy. But be careful with your words from now on. It's really unpleasant to hear from an idealist without ability."

Shirone ground his teeth. What exactly was so dissatisfying? He just wanted to say that life was precious. If even that was called idealism, Shirone had no choice but to prove it.

"Fine, I understand! Let's compete. I'll definitely beat you in this test."

"Haha! By all means, if you can."

Shirone was about to retort when classmates who confirmed Iruki's ability swarmed over, so he kept his mouth shut.

"Iruki, you're really amazing. How exactly did you do it? Can't you teach me too?"

"Why did you hide such ability? Won't you join our research club? With you here, we could finish the project within a month."

All were unanimous in praise. Shirone thought it was natural. Iruki's demonstration in the Image Zone had been that shocking.

"Shirone, your insight shown at the Unbridgeable Bridge was certainly amazing. However..."

Iruki turned around with a meaningful smile.

"My calculations are faster than insight."

Shirone gulped. Since entering magic school, he had faced numerous competitions, but this was his first encounter with such a formidable opponent.

Nade patted Shirone's back consolingly.

"Cheer up. It might sound irresponsible, but from a spectator's perspective, it's truly exciting. Since you're both my friends, I don't care who wins."

"Competition is good, but I hate this kind. Iruki just dislikes me."

"Haha! What can you do? He's originally like that. But you made Iruki go all out, so you're pretty amazing too. The people who might break Class Five's record are probably just you two."

"Huh? There are records and such? How many points?"

"Let me see. As I know, it was 987 points?"

Shirone's eyes went round.

"987 points?"

Setting aside his own score, even Iruki using logs had only reached just over 500 points. He couldn't even imagine how fast one would have to target to score 987 points in one minute.

"That's incredible. Who exactly was it? They must have graduated already?"

"Huh? What are you saying? You're dating her, yet you don't know that? It's Senior Amy."
