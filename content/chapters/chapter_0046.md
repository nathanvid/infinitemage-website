"A-Amy...?"

Shirone blankly recalled her face. Since target form was her specialty, her targeting speed was certainly incredible.

But 987 points—that was truly an unbreakable record.

"Amy-senpai demonstrates tremendous focus in actual combat. Come to think of it, you're similar to her in that regard. How else could she have never lost first place even once until entering the graduating class?"

Just how many monsters existed in this world? No, it was because this was a magic school. It felt as though the entire world was filled with talented people.

"You don't necessarily need to break the highest record, so think of it casually. Before Amy's 987 points came out, the previous record was in the 700s. Even the teachers say it's a score that won't be broken for the next ten years."

It was quite a significant gap. Rather than falling into despair from the start, Shirone set his initial goal at 700 points. With three weeks remaining until the exam, he needed to find a way to raise his score within that time.

'I won't lose. Absolutely not!'

Shirone clenched both fists tightly.

* * *

Whenever Shirone had time, he devoted himself to sequence formulas. If he couldn't count numbers faster than Iruki's calculation speed, the match would be pointless from the start.

Currently, the number of digits he could bundle through modularization was 20. In other words, he had reached the level where numbers increased by 20 at a time. However, this level couldn't match the tremendous unit compression power of logarithms.

'Damn it. What exactly should I do?'

Shirone cast photon output in the training ground until dawn. While his zero-to-sixty speed had improved dramatically, the numbers he could count in one minute were merely in the ten thousands.

'Iruki reached one million on the first day. I need to count faster, much faster.'

Beyond sequence formulas, he needed to understand the exam format as well. If targets poured out infinitely from the beginning, scoring 1,000 points wouldn't be difficult, but there was a specific pattern.

In the first step, 10 targets appeared, and only after eliminating them all would 11 targets appear in the second step. For one minute, the steps continued to rise while the number of targets increased.

Therefore, if he didn't quickly advance through the steps from the beginning, even a late surge wouldn't yield a high score.

'In the end, this is also about zero-to-sixty. Depending on who passes through the steps first, there could be a difference of hundreds of points later on.'

Practice didn't end until dawn. Returning to his dormitory to sleep like he'd passed out, then heading back to the training ground a few hours later to practice sequence formulas—this was the beginning and end of each day.

During the practical exam period, integrated classes were canceled and classes took turns, so the training ground was quiet.

Students shared each other's know-how or practiced sequence formulas while waiting for their turn in the Image Zone. However, Shirone found even the time spent waiting in line too precious, so he focused on sequence formulas until it was his very last turn.

When his turn finally came, Shirone entered the Image Zone and poured out all his achievements without holding back. Each time targets touched his irregularly shaped Spirit Zone that moved like a living creature, flashes of photon output sparkled brilliantly.

As he adapted to active magic, he became capable of wielding photon output even while omitting magical actions. This allowed him to hit targets without looking back.

His final score was 567 points. Since it was higher than Iruki's demonstration score from before, Shirone regained confidence. Conversely, the other students' confidence diminished.

"He raised his score by over 200 points in just one week. What's with this? No matter how exceptional his talent, this is completely unfair."

"He's adapted to the offensive form Spirit Zone. While magical actions can increase power, they create obsessions that make chaining difficult. From what I can see, he's casting at least four times per second."

As fewer students used the Image Zone and the area finally became empty, Iruki appeared belatedly. He had been sitting in a corner doing nothing, just spacing out and resting until now.

"I guess it's my turn now?"

Smiling at Shirone, he activated the device. His separation form Spirit Zone became even smaller than before, now only the size of a fist.

The brilliantly moving Spirit Zone eliminated targets. While Shirone's flashes were spectacular, Iruki's sense of speed was equally thrilling.

After one minute passed, Iruki walked away with his hands clasped behind his back without even checking his score. Final score: 568 points. Exactly one point ahead of Shirone.

While it could be dismissed as coincidence, Shirone intuitively knew this was also a calculation of savant syndrome ability.

As expected, his intuition proved correct. Each training session saw Shirone's skills improve dramatically, but they were always overshadowed by Iruki's demonstrations that stayed ahead by exactly one point.

Stimulated, Shirone devoted himself even more to sequence formulas. The number of digits bundled through modularization exceeded 100. The time required for zero-to-sixty became merely an instant, and his Spirit Zone's performance improved beyond recognition. He realized that shortening zero-to-sixty reduced the time he could maintain his Spirit Zone, but with endurance as his forte, he felt he could somehow endure for about one minute.

Shirone's scores rose day by day. He easily surpassed Class Five's average of 500 points and finally entered the 600s.

But the winner was always Iruki. Moreover, the situation of leading by exactly one point was so dramatic that the students got more excited about Iruki's demonstrations than Shirone's.

The final training session before the exam arrived.

Since scores from the final inspection were usually reflected in the actual exam, the students' concentration was higher than ever.

Shirone gritted his teeth and eliminated targets. Flashes shot in all directions as if his body had transformed into luminescent material.

When the spectacular light festival ended, all the students cried out without exception.

Final score: 700 points. Excluding Amy's record, it was a score approaching Class Five's highest record.

"So that score is actually possible. I never thought I'd see the 700s with my own eyes."

"You can't reach the 700s without passing the tenth step within 10 seconds. Just how many does he eliminate per second?"

Shirone checked his score and clenched his fist. It was a score that had risen by a whopping 70 points from the previous class. Moreover, he had finally reached his target of the 700s.

As Shirone came down the stairs, Iruki brushed past him and said:

"Congratulations. 700 points is definitely impressive. Your growth rate is frightening."

"Because I absolutely don't want to lose to you."

"Hehe, I see. But don't let your guard down. The exam hasn't even started yet."

Shirone snorted as he descended from the Image Zone. When he turned around, Iruki had already begun the Speed Gun.

Students exclaimed in admiration.

"Wow! Being able to shrink the zone that small is also an ability."

Iruki compressed his Spirit Zone to the size of a marble. Due to its extremely fast movement, even afterimages were hard to see.

Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-BANG!

As if the targets were bursting on their own, explosive sounds rang out consecutively around Iruki at the center of the Image Zone.

When Iruki's demonstration ended, Shirone's face turned pale. Final score: 701 points. He had once again surpassed Shirone's score—achieved through his utmost effort and a leap of over 70 points—by exactly one point.

Students couldn't contain their excitement at Iruki's showmanship and shouted. Though their own exams were imminent, they forgot even that due to how intense the competition between the two rivals was.

'701 points? Again a one-point difference?'

Shirone felt anxious for the first time. Cold sweat formed on his palms and his mouth went dry. If Iruki had used all his strength to achieve the highest possible score, he wouldn't have been this tense.

But once again, it was a one-point difference. This meant he could score even higher if he used his full power.

While the exam period was next week, Class Five's schedule was the earliest, leaving only three days. Could he close the gap in that time? Carrying all sorts of anxieties, Shirone left the training ground powerlessly.

* * *

Students' favorite day off. On days like this, young men and women would normally pair up and walk around together, but with exams right around the corner, the central park was quiet.

On the other hand, Seriel hummed as she crossed the park, as if days like this were perfect for walks. Having submitted her application for graduating class advancement, high-level class exams were now someone else's problem.

"Amy! Over here, over here!"

Amy was reading a book by the fountain. While she maintained her pretty appearance, up close her eyes looked hollow and her already thin body had become even more gaunt.

"Wow! You've gotten skinny since I last saw you. I guess the graduating class is tough."

Amy chuckled softly and handed over some documents.

"Welcome to hell. Here, the graduating class materials you requested."

It was data recording graduating class students' grades and specialties. Since any graduating class student could access it, this wasn't cheating.

"Thanks. Let's sit down first. Want to drink something?"

"Let's have coffee. I feel like I've been living on coffee lately."

The two entered a cafe, got two cups of coffee, and sat on a bench. Without any particular conversation, they just killed time watching birds fly by.

Unlike other girls, Amy wasn't the type who enjoyed chatting. Moreover, this kind of quiet was the ultimate peace she couldn't taste in the graduating class.

The reason chatterbox Seriel said nothing was also because Amy emanated the scent of a weary warrior. Though she had grown thin, she radiated the unique aura of the graduating class.

There's a saying that class makes the person. While every day might be hell for Amy, during her time enduring it, she had already created an enormous gap with the high-level class.

'That aspect would definitely play a role too. I need to advance quickly as well.'

Amy, who had been loudly slurping her empty iced coffee, spoke for the first time.

"How is Shirone doing these days?"

"I was wondering when you'd ask. Haven't you really met even once? Haven't you heard any rumors?"

"I don't know. I don't have time to meet, and the graduating class has completely different classes from the high-level class. I did hear Samuel went as a teaching assistant last time."

"I see. Actually, something interesting has been happening in Class Five lately."

Amy turned her head with an expression asking what she meant while holding her straw. Like a fish meeting water, Seriel began chatting away. The gist of the story was that an exciting confrontation between Shirone and Iruki was unfolding ahead of the Speed Gun exam.

"He used logarithms to reduce units? That's creative. Well, I suppose that's just like Iruki."

"Huh? You know Iruki?"

"Of course I know him. We were classmates. Though I advanced quickly so I didn't see him for long. You know what he has, right? Savant syndrome."

"Oh? You really know about it? Did you talk with him? He doesn't seem to get along with people."

"Yeah. When I first entered Class Five, he came up to me and started talking."

Seriel's eyes widened as she shouted.

"What? He hit on you? How wonderful! Then this is a confrontation between rivals with the person they love in between! This is completely breaking news!"

"Don't be ridiculous. He's a bit strange, you know. What he says seems right somehow, but I can't relate to it. He probably tried to do to me what he did to Shirone. He was picking a fight from the moment he saw me. I didn't engage with him. I think he also lost interest because I'm a girl."

"Hmm, I see. So he's a so-called genius hunter? I guess Shirone got unlucky and got caught."

"It's not necessarily unlucky. It's an obstacle he had to face once. Still, it must be difficult. It's a targeting exam, and if Iruki uses logarithms, he'll probably get quite a high score."

Seriel glared with sharp eyes.

"How can you say that? Your boyfriend is in crisis. Even if you can't help, you should at least cheer him on in your heart. What will you do if Shirone loses to Iruki?"

"Competition means you can lose sometimes. Why are you making such a fuss?"

Unlike before, Amy seemed to feel no particular emotion. This was probably because she was fighting wars incomparable to the high-level class every day.

Seriel found this fact rather disappointing.

"You've never lost even once! I want to see two people with undefeated legends dating! So hurry up and tell Shirone to cheer up. I'll deliver the message myself."

"Forget it. You'll probably exaggerate it strangely again when you deliver it, right? This isn't even an advancement exam, just a practical evaluation. Shirone's goal is also the graduating class. It'll be good experience."

"Then at least tell me some tips for high scores on the Speed Gun. You're the record holder. 987 points."

"Hmm. But any advice I could give, Shirone probably already understands. It's not that I'm not interested—Shirone really is outstanding. He's already exceeded 700 points, right? I'm just specialized in target form, so I had an advantage over others."
