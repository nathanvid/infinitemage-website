When Amy said there was no solution, Seriel made a dejected face. Having watched the two's heartfelt(?) love from the beginning, she was immersed in the situation as if Shirone were the male protagonist of a novel.

"Either way, he can win, right? Shirone has to win."

"Hmm."

Amy rested her chin on her hand and fidgeted with her straw. Mercenary Iruki. Their first meeting had been unpleasant, but he was definitely talented.

"If we're talking purely about targeting, it won't be easy. Savant syndrome is a really powerful ability. If he uses logarithms on top of that, it'll be incredibly difficult for his opponent. Moreover, Iruki is serious, right? If Iruki had seriously challenged me back then..."

"If, if he had challenged you?"

Amy, who had been thinking deeply, pouted her lips as she spoke.

"I might have lost."

Seriel was shocked. Amy, who had never lost first place in the advanced class and set an unchanging record in Class Five, was saying she might have lost.

Since she was staying in the graduating class, a completely different dimension of class, she might be generous in reminiscing about the past, but even considering that, it was a tremendous statement.

"Hiing, then what do we do? Our Shirone."

Seriel's face turned dejected.

The Speed Gun test was one day away.

Shirone sat on the floor of his dormitory, immersed in meditation. He was counting numbers, but it wasn't sequence formulas. If he had been learning techniques until now, today he wanted to find an answer to what sequence formulas really were.

A journey of numbers with a starting point but no destination.

He didn't move even after 10 hours had passed. As time flowed by, in a realm that most humans had never reached, Shirone realized the essence of sequence formulas. It was a shock like witnessing lightning right before his eyes.

When he opened his eyes, dawn was already breaking outside the window. He hadn't eaten or slept for 24 hours, but he felt no fatigue. A light too sacred to be called emotion formed in his pupils.

Shirone looked up at the ceiling, immersed in sorrow.

What he felt was a great realization, but it was also a shudderingly cold reality.

'Is this... truly the truth?'

No one answered him. But Shirone felt as if he had heard an answer.

Although about 30 minutes remained until the exam, the training ground was already packed with participants and spectators. Staff members moved busily about. They had reinforced safety measures and installed scoreboards on all sides of the Image Zone.

Not a single student from Class Seven and Six was absent. It was a cross-section of hierarchical society, trying to make an impression on their seniors.

On the other hand, only students from Class Four who were interested in the confrontation between Shirone and Iruki took time to come up. Among them, the most recognizable person was naturally Seriel, who ranked high in Class Four.

"Oh! Senior! Hello!"

Mark ran over with eyes like he was catching a big fish and greeted her. Seriel smiled and waved her hand, then looked around.

"Right. All the underclassmen came to observe. Well, it was the same in my time."

"What kind of sad words are those? I came here solely to celebrate Shirone senior's victory!"

"Oh! How reassuring! Good! Let's really fire up our passion for cheering."

Seriel and Mark occupied the seats with the best view of the Image Zone. Wherever she walked, a path naturally formed, so the front seats were practically reserved.

Most of the murmuring was about the confrontation between Shirone and Iruki. Shirone, who had a naturally strong Spirit Zone, versus Iruki, who was skilled at strengthening zones through sequence formulas. It was a match to gauge who was truly the greatest talent in Class Five.

The exam would be taken by both simultaneously. The reason they specifically adopted a confrontational format was the school's intention to draw out the students' maximum potential.

For the same reason, based on practice scores, high scorers were placed later in the order. Naturally, Shirone and Iruki were assigned to the last turn, group 20.

When Ethella activated the magic barrier, the scoreboard lit up. After giving them about 10 minutes to relax their tension, the exam was conducted in order starting from group 1.

Since it was strictly a practical evaluation, individual scores mattered, but since Speed Gun was conducted in a confrontational format, it was a subject students could enjoy watching.

The participants couldn't help but be conscious of this aspect. Perhaps that's why, even if they broke their personal records, they came down from the Image Zone with uncomfortable expressions if they lost to their group partner.

It took about an hour to complete the exams through group 10. The current highest record was 533 points, and Nade finished his practical evaluation with 491 points, slightly above the class average.

As time passed, life returned to the students' eyes. It meant they too knew what today's main match was.

Finally, group 19's exam ended and Ethella called out Shirone and Iruki. The noisy cheering sounds quieted in an instant.

Shirone and Iruki climbed the stairs side by side without looking at each other. Fighting spirit could be felt from their backs.

"Wow! Shirone senior, you look really fired up! I heard you're completely behind against Iruki senior in your record."

"Hmph. Shirone is strong in actual combat! It was the same during the Teleportation exam, right?"

When Seriel glared at him, Mark burst into an empty laugh and scratched his head. He was the one who had been hit in the back of the head for underestimating Shirone.

Ethella called Shirone and Iruki over to explain the rules.

"The time limit is one minute, and it starts the moment the red light comes on the scoreboard. Thanks to the magic barrier, there's no chance of invading each other's territory, so approach it thinking of it as an individual event. Especially you two, since the underclassmen are watching, don't do anything embarrassing."

As if trying to save even the mental energy needed to answer, Shirone and Iruki only nodded. When Ethella spread her arms, the two separated and entered their respective areas.

The underclassmen focused their eyes intently, not wanting to miss even a moment of the two's showdown. The sound of swallowing saliva could be heard. Since they both possessed records in at least the 700s, high-speed targeting would surely unfold from the beginning.

Shirone calmly looked forward. His heart was beating fast, but there was no tension. It was a phenomenon that occurred when human concentration was at its highest. When the preliminary lights on the scoreboard turned on, he counted down in his mind.

'3, 2, 1.'

Start!

As soon as the red light came on, Shirone widened his eyes and began the sequence formula. He broke through zero to sixty immediately upon starting, and numbers rushed at tremendous speed.

Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-bang!

Ten photon outputs per second.

Flashes scraped across 360 degrees in all directions. All the targets that rose in the first step exploded. Iruki's separation form Spirit Zone also moved as if scraping through space, eliminating targets.

"Waaah! They're both incredibly fast! Everything exploded right after they started!"

Mark shouted, unable to hide his excitement. The second step and third step were the same. Targets were being eliminated as soon as they rose. When they maintained equal scores through the sixth step, Seriel clenched her fists tightly.

"Good. If it continues like this, the match could go either way."

Shirone and Iruki completed up to the tenth step at the same time. But the next step had 20 targets rising at once. Since neither could handle that number in one breath, the real match was starting now.

The current score was 239 to 237 with Shirone slightly ahead. At this pace, a final score of 700 points could easily be surpassed.

'Good! I'm not falling behind against Iruki giving his all. Let's push forward like this.'

If you make mistakes in targeting, the step difference widens, causing the match to shift dramatically. But flash Shirone and separation form Iruki hadn't missed a single target.

377 to 377 points.

At the 30-second mark, Iruki caught up to tie. Feeling a sense of crisis, Shirone accelerated his sequence formula. As his Spirit Zone strengthened, the flash combination speed increased.

When Shirone took the lead with a 4-point advantage, now it was Iruki who became impatient. Unlike during practice when he had taken it easy, he was currently targeting with all his might.

'But I'm still falling behind? My calculation speed?'

Just three days ago, Iruki's victory had been a foregone conclusion. Raising the level of sequence formulas in such a short time was impossible.

'I can do it! My strategy is working!'

Shirone caught up to Iruki's speed by removing the restrictions of modularization. If he had been bundling numbers in units of 100 until now, he was currently processing whatever came his way: 232, 187, 99, 276. It was a strategy that sacrificed stability for speed, but based on the defensive form's mental endurance, his concentration hadn't wavered yet.

469 to 432 points.

When Shirone first left Iruki behind by a large point difference, the students began to get excited. Even Ethella couldn't take her eyes off the tension of an unpredictable match.

Iruki finally grasped Shirone's strategy.

'He removed the restrictions of modularization? He doesn't care about exam grades at all. He's taking a gamble with the sole intention of winning.'

The corners of Iruki's mouth turned up. How long had he waited for this moment? An existence that could draw out everything he had. Meeting the greatest rival of his life, he gladly accepted the match.

'Shirone, the gamble I'm making is on a different level from yours.'

Iruki increased the difficulty of his sequence formula. The change happened immediately, and students looked puzzled. Another rhythm was seeping through the rhythm of consecutive explosions.

"Huh? What's that?"

542 to 558 points.

Not only did he catch up to Shirone's score, but he completely overtook it. It was impossible without producing more than double the speed in an instant.

"Seriel senior! What happened? Did Shirone senior make a mistake...?"

"No. Shirone's score is rising too. Rather, Iruki's targeting suddenly became faster."

"Is that possible? He went up 100 points in an instant."

Seriel, who had been staring intently at Iruki's demonstration, finally realized and bit her lip.

"...He created one more Spirit Zone."

Then the students turned to look at Iruki's side. Clearly, two afterimages were flying around, turning in different directions.

Double Spirit Zone was a characteristic unique to savant syndrome that enabled mental division. The reason it was a characteristic rather than a technique was because it could never be learned.

But what truly surprised Seriel was that even though one more Spirit Zone had been created, the speed was getting even faster.

He had to perform different sequence formulas simultaneously. But could a human mind do two calculations at once?

Iruki was proving that it was possible. Moreover, while applying logarithms that made mental calculation impossible.

'Amy was right about his tremendous talent. No, it's not a level that can be explained by talent. He's a mutant beyond human category.'

How powerful savant syndrome was showed clearly in the points on the scoreboard.

692 to 845 points.

It was a point difference of over 100, and Iruki was several steps higher. Once the step difference began, far from a reversal, the gap would only widen as time passed.

'More. Faster.'

Shirone was desperate. The numbers bundled by modularization were averaging over 300. Since they weren't precise matrices, the calculations became increasingly complex and irregular.

732 to 911 points.

Shirone broke his personal record. But Iruki was at a level where he could surpass not just his personal record but even Amy's record. If the exam ended like this, it would be entirely possible.

Only one method remained for Shirone.

There was a realm that could only be reached not by running fast, but solely by leaping over.

But could he do it? Was it really possible?

Again, no one answered him. But Shirone felt as if he had already heard the answer.

'Transcend numbers!'
