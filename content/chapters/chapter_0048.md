Shirone's mind expanded like a supernova explosion, spreading endlessly outward. Perfect opening. Transcending modularization, all numbers that existed in the world pressed inward like they were being compressed into a single point.

Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-BANG!

The targeting speed suddenly skyrocketed. Two streams of light were simultaneously extending from Shirone's Spirit Zone.

"Senior is doing Double too!"

"No, Double is impossible without savant syndrome. That's not on that level."

Seriel couldn't believe the scene unfolding before her eyes. The number of light beams was increasing from ten to twenty, from twenty to a hundred.

Shirone felt perfect liberation. The sensation of permeating every place in the world. The stronger this feeling became, the fainter his thoughts grew. He couldn't think of anything—only his senses touched all things.

His Spirit Zone expanded infinitely. When it exceeded 80 meters in diameter, all the light beams merged together and his Spirit Zone filled with light. Just a massive photon—even Shirone's form was enveloped in light.

Targets appeared and exploded simultaneously, causing the steps to rise at tremendous speed.

'Ah... ahhh...'

Shirone shed tears as he realized his existence was gradually fading. He had transcended numbers. Everything. The end. All that remained was to permeate the world like this.

'Graaah! It's not over yet!'

Iruki gritted his teeth. He checked Shirone's frighteningly rising score, but it didn't matter. If Shirone had increased his speed, he just had to sprint even faster.

'There are no limits to a savant's calculations! One trillion, one thousand trillion—I'll calculate them all! I'll see the end of all numbers that exist in the world!'

Iruki's Spirit Zone moved at speeds the human eye couldn't follow. He's winning. He can win! Time remaining: 1 second! 0.9 seconds! 0.85 seconds! Damn it! Why won't this time pass!

Beep!

The eternally long one minute ended. The targets scattered like phantoms as both Shirone and Iruki collapsed simultaneously.

Unlike Iruki who was panting heavily, Shirone remained motionless. He had already lost consciousness.

Iruki raised his head to check his score.

1,247 points.

An unprecedented record in the magic school's history. A score that surpassed Amy's previous record by a full 260 points.

'Did I win? But why can't I hear anything? What is Shirone doing?'

When Iruki turned his head, Shirone was kneeling with his face buried in his chest, unmoving. He seemed to be breathing, but there was an empty feeling as if no life could be sensed.

Iruki shifted his gaze to Shirone's scoreboard.

1,253 points.

"S-Senior! Senior Shirone is...!"

"Shirone won!"

Seriel cut off Mark's words and ran forward. He had subdued Iruki, who was a skilled practitioner that even gave her goosebumps. She felt like giving him a kiss on Amy's behalf. Of course, only if she gave permission.

The underclassmen also rushed toward the Image Zone. Everyone offered congratulations while shaking Shirone.

"Haaaah!"

Coming to his senses, Shirone opened his eyes wide and drew in breath. As his mind, which had been buried in the realm of meaninglessness, reconstructed itself, things like the names of objects and emotions began to settle in one by one.

While Shirone's side was bustling, no one approached Iruki. Only Nade placed a hand on his shoulder.

"You lost in the end. But it was a magnificent match."

"That's not much consolation. Matches are meant to be won."

Nade chuckled and turned his head toward Shirone. It was truly tremendous talent. To others, it might seem like a simple targeting test, but knowing Iruki's talent, he couldn't even imagine how enormous the insight contained within Shirone's inner self was.

'Congratulations, Shirone.'

Surrounded by students, Shirone wore a sad expression despite his moving victory, showing no joy.

Ethella watched him with a serious expression, lost in thought.

The score difference between Shirone and Iruki was only 6 points. But when considering mental speed, 6 points was an enormous difference.

'Shirone. Could it be...'

In the final scene of Speed Gun, Shirone's Spirit Zone was perfectly filled with light. A situation absolutely impossible with photon output's total capacity. But there was one exception.

'Did he transcend numbers?'

Numbers have no end. Even if Iruki performed number sequences for ten thousand years, he couldn't escape the starting point of numbers' journey.

'Shirone, since when did you know?'

Number sequences expand numbers to strengthen the mind. Then what happens to the mind if one transcends numbers?

It expands infinitely.

Mages call this phenomenon "Immortal Function," but Ethella, being a monk, knew another name for it.

'Nirvana.'

It's a concept that doesn't need to be taught at magic school level and shouldn't be taught. Infinity is a realm that exists at the symmetrical point of the finite. The moment one enters there, an individual's existence dissolves.

Tears welled up in Ethella's eyes.

'Shirone. You mustn't do that. No matter how brilliant it may seem, no matter how splendid it appears, the moment you enter infinity, you will...'

Disappear.

High monks, through long ascetic practices, realize the impermanence of the world and enter the world of nirvana after letting go of everything.

But Shirone was different. For an 18-year-old boy who should be learning about the world and achieving dreams, infinity was too dangerous to embrace.

'Seeing that he only fainted suggests it wasn't perfect. But if he really entered...'

Ethella wiped away her tears and approached Shirone. Shirone's sad face said everything.

"Shirone, you..."

"I'm sorry, teacher."

"Since when?"

"I took a very long... journey."

It was like a Zen dialogue between monks. Perhaps only Shirone knew the true meaning.

Ethella couldn't offer any advice. Since Shirone had realized it and stopped himself, the choice rightfully belonged to him.

"Don't worry, teacher. I really didn't know it would be like that."

All Ethella could do was look at Shirone with gentle eyes and say this:

"Yes, Shirone. Teacher loves you."

The students' eyes widened as they made shocked sounds.

"Whaaaat?"

A teacher confessing love to a student. The situation itself was absurd, and the timing was strange too.

Shirone bowed his head deeply with a reverent heart. The deep meaning in Ethella's words pierced his heart.

"T-Teacher! Did you just say you love him? There are so many teacher fan clubs at school—if you betray them like this...!"

Ethella tilted her head.

"Fan clubs? What's that? And teacher loves all of you."

"What? That's what it was? Hahaha! I thought—! I love you too, teacher!"

"I love you too, teacher!"

The male students began competitively confessing their love. Ethella didn't find it unpleasant and patted the students.

"Now, let's end the test. Everyone gather."

The students lined up in front of the Image Zone. Having given their best effort in the test, they all wore refreshed faces regardless of the results.

"Good work, everyone. But it's nice that test days end early, right? Get some good rest, and from the next class, let's train joyfully again. Everyone worked hard."

When Ethella bowed in the monk's greeting style, the students followed her—half for fun, half as a sign of respect.

"Good work, teacher!"

Ethella descended the mountain first to report the test results to the school. Meanwhile, the students seemed to savor the afterglow of the tremendous duel and couldn't easily leave.

"Shirone! This is so great! Amy will definitely be happy too. No wait, will she be angry that her record was broken? Who cares! Her boyfriend won! Hohoho!"

Shirone endured Seriel's chatter with a tired face. If he could stop her talking, he felt like he could do anything.

As if Shirone's prayers were answered, Seriel miraculously stopped talking and looked somewhere.

Iruki was approaching.

The students watched with interested eyes. They were curious about how the arrogant genius would handle the situation this time, but Iruki's words were unexpectedly bland.

"I lost. Complete defeat."

Shirone shook his head.

"No. I don't think so."

"You don't have to be modest at times like this. Especially when you've heard a genius like me declare defeat."

"I really don't feel like I won. This test was a targeting evaluation. But the magic I cast at the end hit all the space."

"Heh. You're really stuffy. Anyway, that's targeting too. You increased photon output's power and eliminated them all at once. You won, so don't worry about it."

"By that logic, you're the same. If you had maximized the explosion, you could have achieved a similar effect."

Iruki held his stomach and giggled.

"There is such a method indeed. But to cause an explosion of that scale would take quite a long time. Of course, I was pretty desperate earlier, so I might have shortened the reaction formula, but I wouldn't have achieved good results anyway."

Shirone was convinced. But faced with Iruki's behavior that was so different from usual, he couldn't bring himself to respond. If he could persuade so gently like this, why had he picked fights?

"Don't tell me you did it on purpose? To provoke me?"

Iruki blinked as if it was an interesting opinion, then brought up something unexpected.

"I study explosions. To borrow your words, explosions that could kill everyone living in a city."

Shirone's brow furrowed slightly.

"But Shirone, you're misunderstanding. Explosions aren't violent phenomena. Violence contains the will to hurt someone. But explosions have no will. They're just energy much stronger than human standards."

"Just because there's no will doesn't mean people won't get hurt. Because it's humans who handle that energy."

"Exactly. That's why I define explosions like this: uncontrollable energy. But Shirone, energy is life force. So what would happen if humans could perfectly control explosions?"

Iruki spread both arms to express vastness.

"A new era would open. Explosions powerful enough to blow up a city contain energy that could feed 100,000 people. If we could control that, there'd be no need for wars to steal from others, and everyone would live prosperously."

Kind emotions appeared on Shirone's face.

"You should have said it that way from the beginning. We wouldn't have needed to fight unnecessarily."

Iruki smiled bitterly.

"I told you. Ideals are just ideals. One mage can't change the world. Even if I could control explosions, someone would use them to kill tens of thousands. But Shirone, I'll do it anyway. Because someone has to."

"You shouldn't. I understand what you mean, but that's a choice that would make even you unhappy."

"Haha! Right! That's why I said that to you!"

Iruki sat down and looked up at the sky.

"Should I just quit here? Play around in Class Five, and when that gets boring, maybe delve into dungeons. Maybe dangerous guys like me shouldn't have been born."

Shirone looked down at Iruki with complex feelings. What exactly was this kid? An idealist? A realist? Or an indefinable eccentric?

"So from now on, you have to take responsibility for me."

"Huh? Responsibility?"

"You can stop my rampage. If someday the path I pursue brings tragedy..."

Iruki spoke with sincere voice:

"You stop me. If you judge that I have no value existing in this world, end my life with your own hands."

Iruki's way of thinking was cold. But precisely because of that, he saw clearly both the light and shadow of what he pursued.

If it was work that absolutely someone had to do, Shirone thought Iruki should be that person.

"Alright. I'll stop you. No, I'll make sure you never commit terrible mistakes."

Nade, seemingly moved, trembled then pulled both of them into his arms as they descended the mountain.

"Waaah! I really like you guys! Let's work hard together from now on!"

Caught by Nade, Shirone and Iruki looked at each other and laughed. It was the day Class Five's trio was formed.
