Shirone drifted through dark space.

In some places, countless stars were visible, while in others, only darkness stretched on endlessly.

In the darkness, he felt as if he had stopped moving, and fear washed over him that he might never escape for eternity.

One by one, stars began to appear and gather toward a single point. It felt as if space itself was contracting.

He shuddered at the unimaginable size of the stars that no human mind could comprehend. He couldn't picture what would happen when they collided at the final point.

But the collision never occurred. The stars began to collapse, eventually decomposing into dust and being sucked away.

Time was flowing backward.

When he realized this fact, Shirone's physical body had already decomposed and disappeared.

But Shirone did not vanish.

He couldn't understand what this final essence that comprised a human being was, but he still possessed consciousness as he entered the beginning of the world.

He saw strings of light writhing and vibrating like earthworms. Within them, light, time, gravity, and universal attraction were unified.

Finally reaching the end—or rather, returning to the beginning—the entire world filled with light.

The essence that comprised Shirone began to fade as an extreme sense of unity washed over him.

It was a unity like a massive explosion.

"Aaaahhh!"

Shirone screamed as he bolted upright in bed. His clothes, soaked in cold sweat, were as damp as if he'd been caught in rain.

The surroundings were silent, and the moonlit window was tinged with a desolate color. The familiar smell of books filled the air. On his desk, books related to photon theory were scattered about in disarray.

"Phew. Another nightmare..."

He poured water from a pitcher and gulped it down. Opening the window, he let the cool early summer night breeze dry his cold sweat. Only then could he collect himself and sit in his chair.

'Why does this keep happening every night? What's wrong with me?'

Ever since experiencing the Immortal Function during the Speed Gun test, he'd been having similar dreams every day. They weren't exactly nightmares, but the emotions he felt in the dreams were far worse than any nightmare.

"Ugh..."

Shirone hugged his trembling body and rubbed his arms. He felt as if something that comprised him was out of alignment. The problem was that this phenomenon wasn't limited to dreams—he felt it in reality too.

Some sense had become extremely heightened. But he had no idea what kind of information this sense was receiving.

It wasn't that his sense of smell had improved, nor had his sense of touch become more sensitive. His sight and hearing hadn't changed either.

But clearly, some new sensory organ had developed.

"It's not... ghosts or anything, right?"

The piano sound announcing morning could be heard. Confirming dawn breaking outside his window, Shirone entered the bathroom to wash up. Since the advanced class practical evaluation had ended, regular classes would resume today. As the warm water touched him, the strange sensation gradually disappeared. If this state continued all day, he'd have a nervous breakdown. Thinking it was fortunate in one way, Shirone packed his bag.

After the exam period passed, the school regained its former bright atmosphere. Students who had competed against each other returned to being friends as if nothing had happened, chatting and laughing together.

The recent hot topic was Shirone's Speed Gun test. Unlike theoretical exams, practical evaluations had sporting elements mixed in, so it was natural for people to go wild when someone put on a spectacular performance.

Usually, notable students would emerge from each class, but the impact of the Speed Gun test held on the first day was so strong that they were overshadowed by Shirone.

An unprecedented student in the 1200-point range had appeared in magic school history. And there were two of them, no less.

The score difference between Shirone and Iruki was only 6 points, and on top of that, it was a mind-blowing reversal. Since such an outstanding match had taken place on the first day, even when later competitors showed excellent skills, they inevitably paled in comparison.

Shirone had suddenly risen to stardom. He had been famous since early admission, but only as Amy's boyfriend and as a promising prospect with a bright future. But now he was truly a student representing Alpheas Magic School.

Even while heading to the classroom, Shirone received warm welcomes from students. Among them were even seniors from Class Four. The reason senior-junior relationships were strict in magic schools that adopted the early advancement system was that advancement was that difficult, but since Shirone had achieved a historical record, he could catch up at any time, making it awkward to treat him merely as a junior. Come to think of it, Amy's recognition of Shirone as an equal from the start had been excellent foresight.

By the time Shirone arrived at the advanced class building after exchanging greetings with everyone he passed, he was already exhausted.

"Oh? It's Senior Shirone. Hello, Senior!"

"Senior Shirone. I'm your fan. Can I just follow you around from now on?"

Female students from Class Six approached him warmly. Originally, they had been the class that viewed Shirone's early advancement most unfavorably. Since he had jumped from Seven to Five, those caught in between couldn't help but be displeased. But now even seniors from Class Four were thinking of him as a future rival in the graduating class, so they had no choice but to forget the past and change their attitude.

"Senior, what are you doing after class today? We're planning to hold a magic demonstration among friends later. Would you like to come?"

"We decided to go out on the weekend. Please come with us, Senior. I'll be your partner."

"Sorry. I haven't been feeling well lately."

With nightmares every night and eerie sensations suddenly visiting him even when awake, he didn't want to go anywhere. The female students also knew of the insurmountable mountain that was Amy, so they didn't seem disappointed and left after promising to meet another time.

"Shirone, Shirone, Shirone! Shirone, Shirone!"

The moment he opened the classroom door, a classmate grabbed Shirone. Kidnapped before he could even put down his bag, Shirone looked bewildered as he received his friends' attention.

"What's wrong? What's going on?"

"The semester's almost over, so join a research club. We're going to make one among Class Five kids. The performance assessment is a free topic anyway. It'll save time and be fun too. So join us."

"Hmm."

Shirone couldn't readily answer. He'd received many proposals so far, but if he were to join a research club, he thought he should enter the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club where Nade and Iruki were.

"Shirone, don't be like that and consider it. The reason you won't join a research club is because of individual study, right? There are quite a few kids like you here. But you have to do the performance assessment. So we're temporarily making one. Since it's not an item with much discrimination power anyway, we can finish it quickly and disband. Then you can do more individual study."

"Ah, I see."

It was definitely a good strategy. Since performance assessment was a free topic, it had less discrimination power than theoretical exams or practical evaluations. But it would also be shameless to join an existing research club, finish only the performance assessment, and then quit. Therefore, it was Jane's proposal for students without research clubs to temporarily form one to solve the performance assessment.

"Hey! What are you guys scheming? Not Shirone! Shirone is mine!"

Nade hid Shirone behind him and shouted. Students looked at him with bewildered expressions. Especially a friend who knew Nade's situation pressed him sharply.

"How ridiculous. You're trying to get him to join that weird research club, aren't you? Shirone, you absolutely can't go there. You don't have to join our research club, so rather join another research club instead. I've never heard of Nade doing performance assessment in all my time at school."

The Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club boasted a long tradition but had extremely rare official activities. Most students didn't even know Nade had a research club.

"Huh? Nade, you have a research club?"

Nade quickly rolled his eyes and used his characteristic cunning to overcome the crisis.

"Hmph. Of course. Would the school's most popular person not have a research club? Anyway, Shirone can't, so I'm taking him."

Nade grabbed Shirone's wrist and headed for the door. The student who had recommended the research club to Shirone shouted loudly.

"Hey, Shirone! You really need to think carefully! Absolutely don't go there! And Nade, don't interfere with Shirone's studies and just let him join somewhere comfortable!"

"Hahahaha! No matter what you say, Shirone's head is already full of only me! We've already crossed the forbidden line!"

Shirone's face turned pale.

"Wait, Nade. What are you saying right now...?"

Nade didn't give him a chance to protest and closed the door. The students in the classroom looked at that spot with blank expressions.

"...What is he saying right now?"

The student who had shouted at Nade scratched his head vigorously.

"This is bad. That bastard Nade really seems to be thinking of dragging Shirone in. He shouldn't be swayed."

"No, it seems like he's already been swayed? But where on earth did he take him? It's class time now."

* * *

As soon as he came out into the hallway, Shirone shook off Nade's hand. He knew it was a joke, but the creepy feeling didn't disappear.

"Hey! Why did you say something like that?"

"Hahaha! It's not wrong though. You're the only person who's seen the true nature of the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club."

"The true nature of the research club? There wasn't much to see."

Nade looked around at people passing through the hallway and then made Shirone sit down.

"Sit down for a moment."

"Okay. Stop being pushy."

Shirone sat down and leaned his back against the wall. After looking left and right again, Nade spoke in a lowered voice.

"You're the only person who's actually come into the research club. So you absolutely can't reveal anything."

"Whether I reveal it or not, nobody even asks about it."

"Anyway! The management is already talking about disbanding because there are no members. We need to stay as quiet as possible, so don't even mention the 'super' in supernatural."

"I got it. I wasn't planning to anyway."

In Shirone's eyes, the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club looked ruined, but the underground research club members who knew its true value were constantly looking for opportunities to swallow it up. Also, the teachers were frantically trying to disband it.

"But are you really going to join a research club?"

Nade had long known about the strategy of temporarily establishing research clubs at the end of the semester. It was indeed an efficient method, but he thought it didn't suit Shirone's situation.

"I was considering it. Why? Is there a reason I shouldn't?"

"Of course. Performance assessment may not have much discrimination power, but doing a research club with just anyone is still a loss. Besides, you're aiming for the top of the school. Even 1 point is important. Rather than making do with a half-hearted place, it's better to do it alone or enter a proper research club."

In Class Four aiming for the graduating class, there were perfect scorers in specific subjects, so a 1-point difference in performance assessment often became a major variable.

'Hmm. But if I do the performance assessment alone, it'll take too much time.'

Shirone, who had been thinking this way and that, spoke.

"Nade. What if I joined the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club?"

Nade's face lit up. If Shirone joined, it would be the formation of the trio in the research club. They stuck together whenever they had time, but since Iruki often skipped classes, it was more often that they didn't have the right composition.

But Nade couldn't readily agree. It had been 45 years since Alpheas Magic School was established. Most students graduated through graduation exams and went into society, but in the underground they didn't know about, there was another society where various characters lived while doing extraordinary things. The Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club was one of such places.

"Would that be okay? Actually, our research club is close to underground. First of all, supernatural paranormal science is pretty niche. It would be nice if you joined, but honestly, I wouldn't want to recommend it to a friend."

From the attitude of his classmates in the classroom earlier, Shirone could guess that there was some secret to Nade's research club. But he didn't want to choose a research club just for grades. Supernatural paranormal science had been a field he'd been interested in since childhood.

"It's not just for that reason. Actually... I've been a bit strange lately. I was going to ask you guys about it anyway. I wondered if supernatural paranormal science might provide an explanation."
