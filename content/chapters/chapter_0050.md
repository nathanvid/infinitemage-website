Nade immediately showed interest. But just then, the class bell rang, cutting off their conversation.

"The teacher's coming. Let's go in for now."

Shirone temporarily forgot about the research club and focused on his classes. The day's schedule ended with the 5 PM class. Shirone packed his bag with Nade and left the lecture hall.

"Let's hear what Iruki has to say first."

Nade led Shirone to the research club. When Shirone arrived at Magic Warehouse Estas, he stared blankly at the building. If the Estas he had seen before was clustered together like a colony, now it had transformed into multiple towers rising up.

"This is really amazing every time I see it."

"There are 89 buildings, so if you consider the patterns, they're endless. I hope Iruki is awake."

The interior of Estas had changed as much as its exterior. But Nade navigated the complex paths with ease, heading toward the research lab.

"I've been curious - how do you find your way? If the structure keeps changing, marking it wouldn't help, right?"

"Hehe. We don't use such primitive methods. We literally memorize everything. Long ago, a senior member of the research club restored the blueprints of Estas."

Shirone looked surprised. It wasn't simply drawing the blueprint of one building, but understanding the mechanism of a complex structure with enormous patterns.

Nade pointed to the ceiling of the corridor.

"Look, you can see three dots up there, right? That means this is Room 3. For Room 3, you check what color the iron door of the third warehouse is. It's blue, right? Then this location's name becomes 'Room 3 Blue.'"

Shirone's gaze followed Nade's finger.

"Once you confirm that, next you count the number of warehouses connected to this place. There are four branching paths, so four warehouses. Here's the important part - you substitute the room number as X, convert the color to a number as Y, and the warehouse number as Z, then plug them into an equation."

"What equation?"

"It's an equation the seniors created by analyzing Estas's patterns. When you substitute the numbers, you get a solution with two decimal places. You use that number to determine direction. So if you just memorize this equation, you'll never get lost in Estas. It's like a mathematical master key."

Shirone wondered if it was really necessary to go to such lengths for research activities, not even academic classes. Estas with its tremendous patterns. Yet the seniors who calculated all those patterns and completed them into a single equation. Finally, he began to think there might be something unknown to others in this research club.

"But if you have to calculate every time the warehouses change, wouldn't it take too long to get anywhere?"

"Only at first. As you practice daily, you get used to it. It's a routine. After about three months, you'll get a feel for it instinctively."

Shirone understood and nodded.

"That's really amazing. To think the escape blueprint of a maze is an equation."

"There must have been a savant ability user like Iruki among the founding members. Iruki also said it was incredibly beautiful when he first saw the equation. Anyway, you must never reveal this fact. If the master key leaks out, it would be a disaster."

Shirone was grateful that Nade had shared such crucial information with him. But at the same time, it was a way of subtly expressing his hope that Shirone would join the research club.

A place where the unproductive, obsessive madness of seniors from the founding generation had gathered. That was the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club hidden in the Estas labyrinth.

The two walked for about 10 minutes before arriving at the research lab. As before, the sign was crookedly tilted. When they opened the door, a cloud of dust inevitably rose up. But this time they had covered their mouths in advance and avoided disaster.

"Iruki, we're here."

Without even looking, Nade spoke, and Iruki, who had been writing equations on the blackboard, turned around. Seeing Shirone, he smiled.

"Hey, Shirone. What brings you here? I thought you'd never come back to such a damp place."

Remembering the previous incident, Nade burst into laughter.

"Haha! That's right. But now he says he wants to join."

"Oh?"

Iruki widened his eyes in surprise. In his mind, it wasn't the kind of place a model student like Shirone would belong to.

"Joining aside, I came because I have something I'm worried about. I thought I'd get some advice from you guys."

"The genius who beat me has a worry. Even without hearing it, it must be an incredibly impressive worry, right?"

Now that Shirone knew Iruki's personality, even the sarcastic remarks didn't bother him.

"Something seems to have changed since the Speed Gun test. I've been having nightmares and feel uneasy when I wake up. Sometimes I feel like someone's beside me. I wondered if this might be related to something supernatural or paranormal. You guys would be knowledgeable about this kind of thing, right?"

Nade and Iruki's eyes lit up. As explorers of the unknown and critics of the unknown, they were intrigued by Shirone's words.

"Then you've come to the right place. Come, sit here."

When Nade dusted off the sofa, tremendous amounts of dust rose up. Shirone recoiled in horror, waving his hands. He finally realized the identity of the abnormally accumulated dust. It was chalk powder from Iruki.

"No, I'll just stand. Please don't do anything in this room. Or at least clean it regularly."

"Come now. Don't be defeated by mere fine dust, our first client. Please tell us your business."

Nade and Iruki pulled up chairs and sat down. Seeing them wait arrogantly with crossed legs like experts, Shirone was exasperated, but like a thirsty person digging a well, he desperately began to speak.

"The thing is, I've been having these dreams lately..."

Shirone explained the dreams he had been having every day. He also talked about the strange sensations that came at random times.

"I have no idea what's going on. It's not like some ghost entered my body, is it? Have you ever heard of similar cases?"

An unexpected silence fell.

Shirone swallowed nervously. He had expected them to say something, even as a joke, but both their expressions were more serious than ever before.

"What? Why are you like that? You're playing another prank, right?"

Nade scratched his eyebrow awkwardly.

"Um, well... now that I hear it, it's quite something."

"What do you mean? Explain in detail."

"That sensation you felt. The chills, feeling something even though you can't see it. That's what the paranormal psychology field calls 'supersensory perception.'"

"Supersensory perception? Paranormal psychology field?"

As unfamiliar terms emerged, Shirone became even more tense. Nade held his temple, lost in thought, then gave an example.

"200 years ago, a scholar experimented on a death row prisoner. It's called soul transmission - the hypothesis that if a human soul is made of matter, it could be decomposed with electricity. The method was this: confine the prisoner in a sealed metal box conductor and run electrical current through it. But it was too inhumane, so the experiment was stopped midway. Thanks to that, the prisoner saved his life but was unconscious for a month. The problem starts now. When the prisoner finally woke up, he knew everything about the outside political situation that had occurred while he was unconscious."

"That's impossible. How could that be?"

"That's why it was astonishing. The scholar proposed the hypothesis of soul ionization. When the soul was electrolyzed, electromagnetic force was generated that drew the world's information to the prisoner. Of course, he was treated as a madman by the academic world. Plus, there were rumors that the prisoner had bribed the guards to get information to save his life."

"Wow. There was such an experiment."

"Orthodox scholars don't acknowledge it, but it's still a topic of discussion in the paranormal science community. Moreover, the official religious organization, the Spirit Church, recognizes trance states, right? Therefore, soul ionization isn't entirely absurd either. Anyway, the sensation that prisoner felt is called supersensory perception in this field."

Shirone felt a chill down his spine. The term supersensory perception connected with his nightmares, making him think it might really be possible.

"Then it's time for me to state my conclusion."

Shirone snapped out of his thoughts and looked up. He was curious about how logical Iruki was interpreting this. Come to think of it, they made quite a nice duo in this field.

"But first, I have something to ask. You said the supersensory perception started after the Speed Gun test ended, right? Your photon output was definitely different from usual that day. If it's a secret, you don't have to reveal it, but it would help to know."

Shirone thought Iruki was right. To analyze the results, you need to know the cause. Besides, at the time he had been too flustered, but it wasn't something he particularly wanted to keep secret from his friends.

Shirone detailed the process of reaching the infinite realm. From the enlightenment he discovered in the journey of numerical sequences to the transcendence of numbers he had unconsciously awakened under the pressure of confrontation.

Iruki nodded. He already knew the concept from his father. It seemed Shirone had opened the forbidden door.

"Immortal Function."

"Immortal Function?"

"I heard about it when I was young. The absolute function that can solve all the world's secrets. But I think that would be very dangerous. 'Everything' is phenomenologically identical to 'nothing' after all."

At this story echoing Ethella's words, Shirone newly realized how dangerous an attempt he had made.

"I was just thinking about it too, but I didn't know I would really go that far. I never want to experience it again."

Iruki waved his finger as if to say 'what are you talking about.'

"It's actually the opposite. As I said, Immortal Function is already a mental state that's academically studied. Mind is different from knowledge. Just because you understand it intellectually doesn't mean anyone can do what you did. Anyway, hearing your story makes me feel a bit better. Well, to beat me, you'd have to at least reach Immortal Function. Hehehe."

Iruki, who treated Immortal Function - which even Ethella had been wary of - like a party trick, was certainly eccentric. But that attitude actually reassured Shirone.

"Hmm. Anyway, so that was Immortal Function. Got it. Now things are starting to make sense."

"Really? You found the answer?"

Instead of answering, Iruki turned his head to look at the wall. It was as if he was drawing equations on the blank wall surface.

"The paranormal side isn't my specialty, so I don't know much about supersensory perception. But that nightmare you have every day - I can roughly guess what it is. And why you're having such dreams."

Shirone unconsciously clenched his fists.

"Tell me. Any explanation is fine. I'm prepared to hear even absurd stories."

"First, dreams distort or exaggerate memories. But your dreams were probably direct projections of memory. It's called psychological regression - the same principle as when a hypnotized person vividly recalls their past. Anyway, if we assume your nightmare is that kind..."

"If, if we assume?"

"What you saw was probably... the universe."

"The, the universe?"

Shirone knew what the universe was. The great world beyond this world. But his knowledge ended there. No, who would know? Since ancient times, humanity had known the universe existed, but no one had actually seen it.

The only species to experience the universe were dragons. 680 years ago, Saint Dragon Gramish, who decided to leave the planet, headed for the universe while representatives of each species watched.

But he ultimately crashed back to earth after just 13 hours. The dragon's corpse was said to be in a wretched state at the time.

Following Gramish's dying words, the representatives of each species separated the corpse and returned to their homelands, and the evidence obtained there later played a crucial role in developing cosmology.

"What I dreamed of... was the universe?"
