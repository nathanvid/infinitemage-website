"My major is computational physics. Given the scale of space, speed, and form, such phenomena could absolutely never occur anywhere but in the universe. The values are far too large to implement on the continent."

"But how could I dream something like that? If it's psychological regression, that means it's my memory, but I've never been to space."

"That's probably true, but memories can exist even without going to space. And from here on, this is Nade's field of expertise again."

The moment he heard Iruki's words, a thought suddenly flashed through Shirone's mind.

"Supersensory perception..."

Nade nodded.

"Right. In the soul transmission experiment, the death row inmate knew about the political situations of various countries that had occurred during the month while he was unconscious. How could that be possible? Did his soul fly around like a pigeon and listen to stories before coming back? Of course, that's possible, but I think that's too human-centered thinking. Eyes and ears are precise biological organs with clear developmental lineages. There's no way souls would have such things. A soul would be a substance with unique properties. When it decomposes electrically, strange effects occur. It combines with other information, or perhaps flies rapidly through space and time."

Iruki also agreed with Nade's words.

"Electrons cannot be observed and measured simultaneously. It's like being unable to confirm the position of a string when you pluck a guitar string. They exist only as probabilities within the range of vibration. This is called quantization, and if souls were ionized, even the universe wouldn't matter. It's a world where the correlation between time and distance breaks down."

Shirone slowly nodded. Nothing had been resolved yet, but as their logic and evidence were presented, his fear seemed to diminish considerably.

"Hmm. I think I'm starting to get it. Thank you so much. You really are worthy members of the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club."

"Haha! You shouldn't be surprised by just this much. Anyway, don't worry too much. You're not cursed or anything. It seems to be connected to the Immortal Function, so let's investigate those aspects going forward."

Shirone nodded and made his decision.

"Alright! I'm going to join the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club too."

Nade had no reason to refuse. Most importantly, if Shirone joined, they would have three members. They would be registered as an official research club and receive the funding that had been cut off a year ago.

"We welcome you anytime. Iruki, you agree too, right?"

"Hmm. For the vision of the research club, Shirone is definitely a good recruitment. But will the administration approve it? His reputation is so bad that many teachers would oppose it."

"Leave that to me. I just need to slip the paperwork in secretly without the teachers knowing. Come on, let's head out right away!"

As if he couldn't wait even a moment longer, Nade left the research room, and Shirone followed behind Iruki with a smile. Just before closing the door, he looked around the research room. Though it was no different from a warehouse and covered in dust, thinking that it would be his research club from now on gave it a certain charm.

"But we'll definitely need to clean it."

Shirone closed the door and turned off the lights from outside. In the quiet, dark room, no presence could be felt. The dust on the sofa was silently swirling around the spot where Shirone had been sitting.

**Overflow (1)**

The atmosphere in the faculty office was busier than usual.

Teachers who had finished their classes would usually drink tea or chat while waiting for their next class period, but now all the teachers were working together to sort through documents.

The task of sorting through dozens of membership applications one by one, recording them in reports, and passing them on to the appropriate departments took more work than expected.

Siena, who had just finished her class and returned, went straight to the pile of documents on the large desk without complaint.

"Oh my. Are these all membership applications? There are quite a lot this week."

"Hehe. It's the end of the semester. This happens every year around this time."

When the semester ended and vacation began, students had to submit papers on free topics until the next semester.

However, since these performance assessments could be replaced by research club presentations, it had become a recent trend for students without research clubs to temporarily join clubs at the end of the semester.

Thad, who was helping with the work, spoke up.

"The kids are just getting craftier. It wasn't like this before. Both research clubs and performance assessments had passion. These days, kids seem to only care about efficiency."

"Haha! It's different from the old days. Competition has become even fiercer compared to ten years ago, and the kids probably have their own stresses. The reason they temporarily establish research clubs is to buy time for individual study."

"That may be true, but aren't they too obsessed with results? There's something called the romance of school days."

Whether agreeing with Thad's words, the teacher could only smile bitterly. As he gathered the documents to pass them to the appropriate department, Siena discovered a document that had fallen under the desk.

"There's one missing here."

"Huh? When did this come in? It looks like someone left it during class."

"Hehe. They must have been quite rushed."

Siena looked over the document to see which student had been scheming. When she confirmed the name, she doubted her eyes and adjusted her glasses.

"This... it says Shirone, right?"

The teacher leaned forward to confirm.

"That's right. Arian Shirone. I thought he wasn't interested in research clubs. Well, since all the students are pulling tricks left and right, I suppose it can't be helped."

Thad snatched the application and looked it over, then frowned.

"I don't think that's it. The research club here is quite famous, isn't it?"

"Let me see it again."

Siena took the application from Thad and examined the research club Shirone had joined.

It was indeed famous.

'Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club.'

The name hit like a bolt from the blue.

Thinking of all the times she had fought with graduates from this club every year since becoming a teacher made her head throb even now.

'Wait? Come to think of it...'

Hadn't most of the troublemakers from the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club graduated last year? She vaguely remembered hearing that their funding had been cut due to insufficient membership.

The teacher smiled and said,

"Come to think of it, I heard Iruki is also affiliated with this research club. Perhaps they hit it off with each other?"

Thad let out a hollow laugh.

"I heard he was impressive during the targeting exam. But it seems they get along surprisingly well. They don't seem like personalities that would match."

Siena spoke with a pained expression.

"Yes. That's exactly the problem."

If Iruki, with talent no less than Shirone's, had influenced him, stubborn Shirone might have changed his mind.

But Iruki of all people.

Wasn't he the biggest troublemaker in the school? Even though they were both geniuses, Shirone and Iruki pursued completely opposite directions.

They could help each other develop, but there was also the possibility that one would devour the other or they would clash and destroy each other. If that happened, it would be a tremendous loss for the school.

'Actually, this works out well. Let's cut this chain of ill fate here.'

Siena opened the file folder and first looked to see who the president of the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club was.

As expected, it was Nade.

A research club that included the two people closest to Shirone recently.

At this point, she thought she understood why Shirone, who had kept his distance from research clubs until now, had joined.

'Nade's supervising teacher is...'

Siena went through the teachers' names looking for the supervising teacher. The moment she confirmed the name, she sighed and held her forehead.

'Sigh. Of all people...'

* * *

The training hall located on the outskirts of the magic school.

Ethella was sitting cross-legged, absorbed in meditation.

The Carsis Order she belonged to was the kingdom's greatest order, with over a thousand monk apprentices. Every year, hundreds of children came in holding their parents' hands, but only a very few were recognized for their talent and became monks.

Ethella was a unique existence even among those children.

She had surpassed countless high nobles and even royalty to become the youngest bishop.

The position of bishop wasn't something one could attain simply by being skilled. The reason Ethella caught the eye of the predecessors was because they discovered her natural disposition as a seeker of truth.

To become the salt and light of the world.

Ethella, who had pledged to live her entire life with this mindset, turned away from wealth and fame to take a position as a teacher at Alpheas Magic School.

'Thank you. For allowing me to safely complete another day of education.'

That's why Ethella was different from other teachers. First of all, her background was from an order, not a school or magic association.

While mages view the world critically, monks try to embrace the world wholly in their hearts without analyzing it.

Infinite gratitude toward nature for allowing her existence, and the sense of mission to share that feeling with othersâ€”this was everything that comprised her.

Ethella slowly opened her eyes. A strange light flickered in her eyes that seemed to pierce through empty space.

Through her Spirit Zone, she could sense one woman approaching this place. She could feel a woman approaching through her Spirit Zone.

With ordinary Spirit Zone, it would be difficult to determine even the gender of the target. However, she was a Zoner, an authority on Spirit Zone, and her detection abilities were at a higher level than other mages.

If ordinary Spirit Zone could be compared to air, a Zoner's Spirit Zone could be called liquid. Because the density of the medium was that much higher, she could feel synesthesia much more clearly.

Ethella stood up and waited for her guest. Only after quite some time did Siena open the door and enter, and she greeted her with a smile.

"Welcome, Teacher Siena."

Siena wasn't surprised that Ethella was waiting for her in advance. She was well aware of how excellent the clarity of a Zoner's Spirit Zone was.

"You were practicing. Am I disturbing you?"

"Not at all. I was just about to finish. Please come in."

"Then I'll excuse myself."

It was rare for Siena to visit the training hall. Thinking the conversation would be lengthy, Ethella heated some tea.

Though she had laid out cushions, sitting on the wooden floor was unfamiliar to Siena. However, she politely knelt and respectfully received the tea Ethella offered.

Having heard that refraining from conversation during the first cup was proper etiquette in the order, Siena didn't say a word until she had emptied the bitter tea.

Although it was summer with long days, golden sunset light was already spreading thickly. Wanting to start the conversation before it got dark, Siena emptied her teacup a bit more quickly.

Ethella considerately opened the conversation first.

"If you've come all the way here, it must not be a light matter."

"Yes. I have something to discuss with you."

"I see. What is it about?"

"You're Nade's supervising teacher, aren't you?"

"Yes. He's a lively and kind student. His grades are in the upper-middle range, but he has sufficient talent. He gets along well with the other children too."

"Do you also know that he's the president of the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club?"

"Of course. Did Nade do something wrong?"

Siena straightened her posture as if showing a resolute attitude.

"I'm planning to disband the research club where he serves as president. I thought it was proper to seek understanding from the supervising teacher beforehand, so I came here."

Ethella smiled gently and savored her tea. After being lost in thought for quite some time, she spoke.

"If it's Teacher Siena's intention, it must certainly be for the students' sake. However, just this once, I'd like to hear the reason."

"The Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club has had many incidents and accidents since before. It's a research club that's been notorious since before I was appointed. Of course, they had achievements to match, which is why the school left them alone, but the situation is different now. When I looked through the documents, they haven't officially held a single presentation in three years. Instead, they've only done things that would warrant disciplinary action."

"But as Teacher Siena said, isn't that in the past? The students currently active are Nade, Iruki, and Shirone. What matters is what activities these children, who are no less capable than Class Four, will undertake. Could you watch over them a little longer? Besides, the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club has quite a tradition at Alpheas Magic School. I believe Magic Association President Gaold is also from there."
