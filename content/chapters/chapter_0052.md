"It's different from when Mr. Gaold attended. Students are passionate about performance assessments, even resorting to tricks. In times like these, if talented children only chase romance, they'll fall behind."

"Hehe. That's just like you, Teacher Siena. Well, those three are promising students the school has high hopes for. If those children fall behind, it would be a huge loss for the school."

Siena didn't deny it. She wanted to help talented students bloom even more. That was Siena's educational philosophy.

On the other hand, Ethella's educational philosophy was the complete opposite. She never showed favoritism or forced anyone to follow a particular path. She thought such methods were inferior to competition. However, looking at the results, the level of students under her care was never inferior to Siena's students.

'Am I being selfish? I don't want to ruin the joy of their school days. But if that leads to wasting their talent, what will happen to the students' future?'

Siena sighed as if troubled.

"Phew. I don't know. I really don't understand. Why do talented children always try to go down different paths? And why did Shirone join such a place?"

Ethella silently stared down at her teacup, lost in thought. She was the only one who knew that Shirone had experienced nirvana.

It was Shirone's experience, Shirone's enlightenment, so she didn't want to spread it around if possible, but it wouldn't be wise to keep her mouth shut even to Siena, who was his homeroom teacher.

"Have you noticed anything strange about Shirone lately?"

"Shirone? Well, there's not just one or two things. It's all because he's hanging around with those children. He probably joined the research club because Nade and Iruki talked him into it."

"Perhaps there might be another reason."

"Huh? What do you mean...?"

"I'm sorry I haven't told you until now. Actually, something like this happened during the Speed Gun test."

Ethella told her about how Shirone had entered nirvana while targeting. Siena's face turned pale.

"Is that true? That's Immortal Function."

Immortal Function was the highest enlightenment, but that didn't mean it was the highest level. In terms of enlightenment alone, there were cases where a beggar on the street had deeper understanding than a mage. It was too dangerous a concept for Shirone, who was still just a student, to control.

"Why didn't you tell me beforehand? This is really a big problem."

Ethella believed there were no big or small problems in the world. Everything depended on one's mindset, and Shirone wanted to decide for himself.

"Shirone already knows. Actually, it would be strange if he didn't. Nirvana is the supreme enlightenment that even I haven't experienced. I thought there was no room for me to interfere in that regard."

"I understand Teacher Ethella's feelings. You can't force something you don't know on others. But what if overflow occurs? It might be irreversible then."

Overflow was a phenomenon commonly found in children who awakened genius-level talent at a mentally immature age.

A complete mind refers to a state as calm as water contained in a vessel. But when it overflows, one cannot control oneself and becomes insane. There was a reason why many geniuses were mad or had eccentric personalities.

The earlier one experienced overflow, the more talented they were said to be, but from Siena's perspective, it was an irresponsible statement from people who liked to worship geniuses.

Siena had also experienced overflow at the young age of 9. In her eyes, the world wasn't a rainbow-colored space full of curiosity. It was merely a gray space filled with mechanical rules.

It was unbearably frightening. So she locked her door and buried herself in darkness. Despite the Oliver School's continuous attention, Siena's condition showed no signs of improvement.

She remembered the world of darkness she had stayed in for a year. And she also remembered the ray of light that miraculously cut through that darkness.

The blonde boy who had opened the crack of light coming through the door wide and extended his hand to her. If he hadn't given her his light, Siena would never have reached this position.

- Siena. Let's go out now.

Siena smiled bitterly as she recalled those times. Her memory was telling her. She must not let Shirone walk the same path she had.

Shirone had achieved rapid growth in a short time. He had been stimulated by interacting with numerous talented people and had continuously broken through his limits through fierce competition. If it was none other than Immortal Function, the possibility of overflow was quite high.

"Teacher Ethella. I suffered from overflow when I was young. You must have too, right?"

"Yes. Of course."

Siena realized it was a foolish question. The average age for mages to reach certified 6th grade was 28 years old. But both of them were not only just 26 years old, they had already been at this level for 6 years.

Considering that the average time to advance from 6th to 5th grade was 10 years, they were already mages ranked high even within the 6th grade.

With this level of genius, it would have been strange if overflow hadn't occurred.

"I first experienced it when I was 7. That's why I entered the Carsis monastery. But thanks to meeting good people, I was able to get through it safely."

Siena felt slightly upset that her experience was two years earlier than her own, but she soon shook her head.

The younger the age, the higher the probability of being crushed by overflow. The terrifying fear of being overwhelmed before even knowing the world would have been beyond what a young child could handle.

"It must have been difficult."

"It was really frightening. If I hadn't been able to enter the monastery, I probably wouldn't have been able to live normally."

At 7 years old, it meant she had awakened as soon as she became aware of the world. Only because it was the Carsis monastery, where the nation's greatest spiritual practitioners gathered, could Ethella have maintained her sanity.

"Then why are you leaving Shirone alone? You know the fear of overflow better than anyone."

"Shirone and I are different. He's not 7 or 8, but 18 years old. Overflow is dangerous because the vessel to contain the mind isn't solid enough. But I believe Shirone has enough capacity to overcome it. Overflow is, in one way, a process of accepting one's genius. If he gets through this crisis well, Shirone will grow even more."

Ethella's words made sense. In fact, Siena's magical talent had also run wild after she passed through overflow.

But it was possible because she had received miraculous help. And as the price for that, someone precious had lost their light.

"I'm not unaware of what Teacher Siena is worried about. But not everyone who experiences overflow collapses. I was the same way."

Ethella was just a unique case. To her, who practiced with the mind of one thought, three thousand worlds, overflow might not have been such a great threat. With such thoughts, Siena spoke.

"I know Shirone's vessel isn't small. But he's awakened Immortal Function. It means the worst situation could occur. If such a thing happens, can Teacher Ethella take responsibility?"

"I don't teach students to take responsibility. I believe Shirone will definitely overcome it well."

"But...!"

"However."

Ethella put down her teacup and spoke firmly.

"If the worst situation does occur, I'm prepared to live my whole life atoning to that child."

Siena closed her mouth. Ethella's resolve had reached beyond that of a teacher to the sacrificial spirit of a monk.

If she hadn't truly been for the students, her free educational policy would have been nothing more than neglect. Perhaps the one lacking in resolve was herself?

Siena, who had put her hands together in prayer, bowed her head in farewell.

The iron door of the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club opened. Shirone waved his arms frantically while exhaling with a "puff" at the dust rising from the floor. Behind such a Shirone, Nade entered with a tired expression. He then threw his bag aside and jumped onto the sofa.

Iruki was playing chess. He was holding black and white alternately, his hands moving without even time to think. As one game ended in an instant, he rearranged the pieces and started the next game.

"You're here? How was today?"

Nade, with his feet up on the sofa backrest, spoke in a sleepy voice.

"So-so. Nothing particularly interesting happened."

Shirone sighed at his friends' appearances. Iruki skipped classes every day and only played chess, while Nade, even when he bothered to come to the research club, only slept.

"Iruki. You skipped afternoon classes again today, didn't you? What are you going to do if you fail?"

"It's fine. I just need to raise my grades to make up for what I lose in attendance."

It was an annoying answer, but he couldn't refute it because what Iruki said was true. Currently, Iruki was maintaining his position in Class Five with only his science scores. Conversely, it meant his humanities scores were 0. Since he had room to easily raise about 20 points in his overall average, it was okay for him to be relaxed.

'But isn't this too much? I've never seen kids in Class Five who don't study like this.'

Iruki, who skipped classes every day, was avoiding failure with only his science scores, and even Nade, despite being lazy, never fell from the upper-middle rankings. Watching this made him feel like a fool for studying so desperately.

"I think I joined the research club for nothing."

"Hey, why are you being like this? You know there's no backing out, right?"

"No, I'm serious. If I stay here, I feel like I'll go crazy first."

"What are you talking about? What did we do?"

"You call this a research club but you don't do any activities, you just play around. And yet your grades are better than mine. Being with outstanding guys like you just makes my anxiety grow."

"Do you think that joke is funny right now? You completely destroyed me in the test, and what are you talking about?"

"Right. Your excessive humility sounds incredibly arrogant."

Nade joined in. Comparing Shirone's grades, who hadn't even been enrolled for a year, with theirs, who had been educated since childhood, didn't make sense at all.

"No, I'm serious. From now on, I want to reduce my research club activities. You guys aren't planning to do performance assessments anyway, right? It would be better to study during that time."

Iruki and Nade finally realized he was serious. True to being a model student, he couldn't stand it if he didn't study even for a moment.

"Then how about studying here instead?"

"Huh? Here?"

"Yeah. We feel a bit sorry for you too. We want to hang out together, but it seems like we're getting in your way. It's not bad to do it here, right? Maybe we'll get motivated too."

"Hmm."

Shirone, lost in thought, nodded. He didn't think he'd be able to study well in such a strange research club, but if it would motivate his friends, it was worth trying. He swept the trash on the table to the floor and put his bag on it.

"Alright. Then I'll study here. But don't disturb me."

"Hehe. Don't worry. We're busy people too."

As soon as he finished speaking, Nade flopped down on the sofa.

"So what should we do now? It's really boring."

A vein popped in Shirone's temple. But since this was nothing compared to the difficulties he would face, he suppressed his anger and started studying. Then Iruki, who was already on his 34th game of chess, moved his pawns and bishops busily while speaking to Nade.

"If you have nothing to do, look at picture books. I brought this month's issue."

"Ooooh! Really?"

Nade, who sprang up as if bouncing, crawled under the table into the pile of trash and dug in as if digging a tunnel.

'Picture books? A collection of famous paintings?'

Although Nade moving under his feet was cumbersome, since Shirone was also interested in art, he left him alone for now. Nade, who had emerged from the trash pile, crawled out from under the table and waved a book in the air.
