"Hahaha! The latest issue of the picture book! How long have I been waiting for today?"

Shirone glanced over and examined the picture book, his face burning hot with embarrassment. The cover was far from being a masterpiece. A woman's nude figure was drawn from neck to thighs, with the words "Women's Anatomy Research Society" written along the binding line.

"What on earth is that weird book?"

"Aha. You wouldn't know. This is what we call a picture book. It's a privilege that only a select few at the magic school can enjoy."

Iruki added with a chuckle.

"In simple terms, you could call it the unproductive amusement of people with nothing better to do. Kek kek kek!"

Picture books were slang used among students for books containing semi-nude drawings of women's bodies.

Naturally, they weren't official publications but pornographic books published by teams of students who majored in art at the school.

The publisher was a place called the Women's Anatomy Research Society, an unofficial research group. Despite this, it enjoyed tremendous popularity among students in the know. This was because they drew not just simple semi-nudes but depicted people from the magic school itself.

Female students, female teachers, and sometimes even male students or male teachers—anyone belonging to the school could become their models, which is why the school was having such headaches over it.

The school periodically confiscated the publications, but since they operated in cells and were elusive, the key figures had yet to be identified. According to rumors, the leader of the Women's Anatomy Research Society was said to be in the graduating class, but this wasn't confirmed fact.

After hearing the explanation, Shirone wore a dazed expression. In some ways, this research society was committing far more outrageous acts than anything Iruki or Nade had done.

"So you're saying Iruki also reads these kinds of books? That's unexpected."

Without taking his eyes off the chess board, Iruki wagged his finger.

"It's simple information gathering. The Women's Anatomy Research Society is resourceful and collects all sorts of rumors."

Nade showed the back pages of the picture book. As Iruki had said, detailed explanations were attached.

Everything was meticulously recorded—female students' backgrounds and personal details—requiring far too much labor to be called a hobby.

Their insistence on semi-nudes was also a clever way to circumvent the civil laws of Creas City. Even so, the poses were so lewd that even laypeople could tell they were far from art.

Nade exclaimed in admiration as he flipped through the picture book.

"Whoa! This month's issue is really amazing! Iruki, can I tear out page 7 here?"

"Do whatever you want. I've already memorized all the information anyway."

Shirone stared blankly at Nade. What on earth was he planning to do with that torn page?

"Instead of doing your studies..."

Nade burst into laughter. This was probably a first—a model student like Shirone entering the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club, which had been a gathering place for delinquents.

"Shirone. You'd better get used to it quickly. If you stay here, you'll discover there are far more interesting things than classes. Once you've been here a little while, you'll realize it's definitely not a loss."

Nade's face suddenly hardened as he cheerfully turned to the next page. He glanced at Shirone nervously and said.

"Hey, Shirone. Don't be shocked, okay?"

"What is it this time? Is there something even more shocking left?"

"Well, you see, in this picture book... Senior Amy appears."

"What?! Give that here!"

Shirone hastily snatched the picture book away. An embarrassing drawing decorated the entire page. It was realistic enough to be mistaken for a real photograph.

"Shirone. Don't misunderstand, just listen. How similar is it to the drawing? I was just curious about it all along."

"Similar my foot! And how would I know that!"

Iruki shrugged his shoulders and giggled.

"Don't you know Shirone's personality? It doesn't seem like you're really dating either. Honestly, you probably haven't even held hands yet, right?"

"Hmph. You guys should worry about yourselves. Mind your own love lives."

Shirone turned his gaze back to the picture book. Setting aside other thoughts, it showed tremendous skill. It felt like there was a living person on the paper.

'Even someone like me who doesn't know much can tell this is incredible talent. But why are they doing something like this?'

Shirone grabbed the page and tore it out. Having Amy featured in a book like this was truly unpleasant.

"Ugh..."

Unable to bear looking at it, he turned his head away while tearing the page, causing Nade to clutch his stomach and burst into laughter.

"Bwahahaha! What are you doing right now? Don't be so sensitive. It's all just imagination anyway, except for the face. It's not like they actually saw anything."

Shirone glared at him. Whether it was imagination or reality, Amy was a friend who had fought alongside him against the Black Magicians. If he could, he would find the Women's Anatomy Research Society and disband it completely.

"Anyway, stop looking at books like this. If you guys aren't going to study, let's do something productive. This is supposedly a research society, but are you just going to lounge around like this all day?"

Realizing that studying here was impossible from the start, Shirone decided to look for something he could do with his friends.

"Then how about we look at Nade's inventions? The patent list of Nade the know-it-all."

"Oh, right! I haven't shown them to Shirone yet."

Nade crawled back under the table. Curious about what might be in the pile of junk, Shirone bent down to look inside. Surprisingly, a safe was hidden there.

"Ta-da! How about it, Shirone? Can you see this?"

Shirone blinked vacantly. Nothing was visible in Nade's hands. But looking closely, he could feel the scenery shimmering along certain boundaries.

"Could this be...?"

"Haha! This is what we call an invisibility cloak!"

An invisibility cloak was an object that used electrical force to refract light, creating the illusion that light was passing through. He had read about it in books, but this was the first time seeing one in person.

"Did you really make this yourself?"

Shirone couldn't believe it. While he wasn't deeply versed in magical engineering, he knew full well how valuable an invisibility cloak was.

Electrical magic showed strong aspects in combat, but it also had infinite industrial value.

In fact, the magic most commonly used by electrical mages wasn't lightning magic but illusion-type magic that created mirages.

The ultimate illusion magic would be Invisibility, a transparency spell, and the invisibility cloak could produce exactly the same effect.

Though it wasn't Nade's original invention, being able to replicate and produce an invisibility cloak required professional-level engineering skills.

"My dream is to become a magical engineer. Of course, compared to the expensive invisibility cloaks on the market, this is pretty shabby. The materials are low-grade and the charging technology is poor, so the effect only lasts for one hour after injecting electrical power. But this is pretty good for what it is, right?"

When he put on the cloak, Nade's figure smoothly disappeared. The quality of an invisibility cloak depended on the light refraction rate. If the refraction rate dropped below 95 percent, it couldn't be called invisible, so a 1 percent difference became the standard for measuring technical skill. With Nade's current abilities, he couldn't achieve 100 percent refraction, but the transparency effect was certainly of solid completion.

When Nade moved, a faint boundary line could be detected. However, when he stood still, it was impossible to tell someone was there without careful observation.

Shirone was in continuous amazement. Creating magical implements sold on the market independently required not only magical knowledge but alchemical knowledge as well.

"Amazing. If you had put that effort into studying, wouldn't your grades have been much better?"

"Hahaha! That might be true. But I'm happiest when making things rather than magic. I have several others besides this. Look."

Nade took out various items from the safe again. A miniature of an electrically-powered carriage. Things like hologram visions that projected illusions when drawings were placed on crystal plates also showed considerable completion.

Among them were flash bombs and smoke bombs incorporating Iruki's ideas, but they fell far short of the items in Nade's patent list.

Watching Nade passionately introduce his creations, Shirone realized something. This wasn't wasting talent. Rather, in his own field, he was ahead of students of the same age.

"This carriage's power system has a rotation speed per second of no less than... Huh?"

Nade, who had been talking excitedly, suddenly looked up at the ceiling as the room began to shake. The vibrations grew stronger, and the chess board shook, causing the pieces to topple left and right.

Iruki immediately rushed out to check the corridor and returned. As if realizing something, urgency showed on his face.

"Damn! A teacher's coming! Quickly hide the stuff!"

"What? What's happening?"

There was no time to explain. Nade skillfully hid the picture book and gathered items like smoke bombs—the research society's unofficial operating funds—stuffing them into the safe. After the rule-violating items were dealt with, he dragged the panicking Shirone to the sofa and shouted.

"Shirone! Sit here! It's a surprise inspection!"

Estas's mechanical system began to operate. The flashing red warning lights in the corridor announced that the warehouse containing the research society would soon be summoned to the first floor.

"A teacher is coming? But what good does sitting do? Shouldn't we greet them?"

Nade pushed Shirone, who was trying to stand up, back down onto the sofa.

"Forget it! Act calm as if nothing happened. If they find the picture book or smoke bombs, this won't end with just detention."

"Huh? Oh, okay."

Shirone used his characteristic mental technique to regain his composure. His friends were amazed by his mind control, which was cold enough to feel chilling, even in the midst of their urgency. Having finished preparing for battle, they waited for Estas to reach ground level.

* * *

"Ugh, how annoying."

Siena rubbed her throbbing head. The time for Estas to bring a warehouse down to the first floor was at least three minutes—enough time to escape or conceal evidence.

In the past, some teachers had raided the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club without activating Estas. But they had only wandered the building for over an hour and ultimately failed to find the research room.

Meanwhile, the members freely entered and exited their research room. She could roughly guess how they did it—analyzing the cube's movement patterns centered around the research room to deduce routes.

While Estas was commercialized as a magical warehouse, the manufacturing company still hadn't released the blueprints. It was absurd to teachers that some student from 20 years ago had solved this and was now using it as the research society's concealment technique.

Siena crossed her arms and tapped her foot while waiting for Estas to reach completion. The three minutes felt unbearably long.

'The more I think about it, the more irritating it gets. How did they figure out a pattern that even teachers couldn't find? And if they found it, they should use it for something constructive. What on earth should we do about these research societies?'

This was why underground research societies were problematic. If they were simply doing bad things, the school could control them. But their intellectual abilities had already exceeded the school's control in most cases.

Even the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Club consisted of exceptionally bright students who could toy with delinquent clubs like the Black Magicians if they set their minds to it.

'What was Shirone thinking when he joined? Even with the Immortal Function, how could these kids be of any help? Moreover, if he joins here, his performance assessments will be ruined too.'

Nade, who was ordinary at school but showed cunning like other underground kids only in the research society. Iruki, a problem child from Class Five who was born with savant syndrome abilities yet skipped classes whenever he was bored. And now Shirone, the school's top model student, had joined them. How could these three incompatible people stick together and hang around?

'Does talent attract talent? Well, Nade and Iruki are at a level where they can interact as equals, but...'
