title: Chapter 54 - Overflow (4)

Siena steeled her wavering resolve. Shirone, who had awakened Immortal Function, could fall into overflow. Ethella had said he could overcome it on his own, but if the worst-case scenario she feared became reality, Shirone's life would become miserable.

While she was lost in thought, Estas came to a stop. Siena entered without delay. Walking down the corridor, she flung open the iron door bearing the sign for the Paranormal Science Research Society.

Through the pale smoke rising in the air, she could see the children sitting there. As expected, they showed no signs of surprise and wore relaxed smiles, which made Siena's anger flare up again.

It was a familiar scene to her. The only differences were that the troublemakers she had clashed with so persistently had all graduated, and Shirone had been newly added to fill their place.

'Why do students change whenever they join this research society? Not just anyone, but even Shirone.'

Normally, Shirone would have greeted her with a bright smile, but now he maintained a perfect poker face. She had expected it, but couldn't help feeling slightly disappointed. Next to Nade, who was arrogantly crossing his legs, sat Iruki, slouching carelessly in his chair with his head tilted back toward the ceiling. Their attitude alone created an atmosphere that pushed teachers away, and Siena entered with a sneer.

"Don't you greet your teacher when you see her? You little..."

"We were so absorbed in our discussion that we lost track. Welcome."

Nade spoke with a cold expression. The research societies, being autonomous student organizations, had grown to occupy a position as one of the pillars of the magic school community by thoroughly maintaining their policy of guarding against teacher interference. Having conducted an unscheduled inspection while completely ignoring such traditions, there was no way their feelings could be good.

'Hmph. School is school and research society is research society, is that it?'

But their arrogance would end today. The teachers' council had already approved the dissolution of the research society, and they had reached an agreement with Ethella, the supervising teacher, on acceptable terms.

"By the way, what brings you here, teacher? We've been keeping quiet lately without any particular incidents."

"An official notice came down regarding the research society. I came to deliver it personally."

"Then please come in. Though it's humble."

Nade brushed off a spot on the sofa with his hand. His attitude suggested he had nothing to feel guilty about.

"Thank you. While you're at it, why don't you offer me some tea?"

"Would you trust and drink tea that I serve? As you know, when Estas moves, no one can find this place."

Siena raised one eyebrow with a mocking smile. She already knew there wasn't even a cup of cold water in this shabby warehouse, let alone tea. Though she didn't like what they were doing, she couldn't entirely dislike these children who showed such wit.

"Right. Now that I think about it, the teacher is feeling a bit uneasy too. Then I'll get straight to the point. I'd like you to return the research room within a month."

Nade's eyes widened. At these words that came like a bolt from the blue, he immediately reverted to his status as a student and asked accusingly.

"What? Return it? Why so suddenly?"

"After reviewing the documents, it appears you've been operating without meeting the required number of members this semester. The school has already cut funding as well. So I'd appreciate it if you could wrap things up within a month."

"Wait a minute! Shirone has joined us now! From three members, we can be recognized as an official research society!"

"But you have no activities, don't you? If you want to save the research society, you have no choice but to produce research results within the deadline of one month. Of course, I don't know what kind of research you could possibly do in the field of paranormal whatever-it-is."

"That's unreasonable! Research societies don't necessarily have to hold presentations!"

"It's a special situation. The research room existing within Estas, and your particularly high notoriety. There are few research societies with as little activity as yours. The fact that I gave you a month was also because Teacher Ethella asked for it. You should be grateful."

Shirone was dumbfounded. Just when he was beginning to develop some affection for the research society, they were talking about dissolution out of nowhere.

"But there's one way to save the research society."

Nade urgently leaned forward.

"What is it? What do we need to do?"

"Remove Shirone from this research society. Then I'll turn a blind eye at least until next semester."

"Whaaaat?"

As Siena had expected, Nade shot up from his seat.

"That's ridiculous! We didn't drag Shirone here by force, and the three of us are friends who always stick together at school. Why do you keep trying to tear us apart?"

Iruki spoke up.

"If it's because I've been skipping classes, don't worry about it. When it comes to studying, we each stick to our own methods."

Shirone couldn't just sit and listen either.

"I feel the same way. I know the research society has a bad reputation, and I know Iruki and Nade aren't diligent about classes. But both of them are doing their best to study in their own fields. They're certainly not wasting time. So please show us mercy."

Knowing that Siena particularly cared for Shirone, Nade held onto a sliver of hope. But she stuck to her principles and spoke firmly.

"Saying that won't help. Above all, Shirone, this is also a decision made for your sake."

"A decision for my sake? I think I'm working hard though?"

"Shirone, what's been happening to you lately?"

Shirone's heart sank. Nade and Iruki also avoided Siena's gaze.

Seeing their reaction, Siena had an intuition. As expected, he had told his friends everything.

"You guys are really terrible. Especially you, Irukiâ€”you must have known that Shirone could fall into overflow, so why didn't you inform the teacher?"

Shirone turned to look at Iruki.

"Iruki. What is overflow?"

"Just... it's nothing much. A phenomenon that occurs when you achieve an awakening higher than your current level? I went through it when I was eight too."

Siena wasn't satisfied with Iruki's explanation.

"If you fall into overflow, your mind could collapse. I heard about Immortal Function from Teacher Ethella. If you miss the timing, recovery might be impossible."

Shirone bit his lip and fell into thought. Even now, he had nightmares every night and suffered from supersensory perception. Sometimes he worried he might go crazy at this rate. If this situation continued, there was no guarantee he wouldn't.

Shirone asked Iruki again.

"H-how was it? In your case?"

"Hmm. For me, it really wasn't much. It was a bit scary though. When I told my father, he said I was originally that kind of guy so I could just live like that for the rest of my life."

Siena made an incredulous expression. When a young son came crying to tell him something, that was all he had to say? But considering who Iruki's father was, it was understandable. In any case, it was an undeniable fact that his father's neglect had played a role in forming Iruki's eccentric personality.

Siena asked Nade with the desperation of grasping at straws.

"Nade. As a friend, what do you think?"

"Hahaha. Well? I don't know what overflow feels like."

Siena, who had hoped that hearing his friends' experiences would change Shirone's mind, sighed. Still, she had at least impressed upon him the danger, so Shirone would follow her wishes.

"Anyway, for that reason, Shirone will withdraw from the research society. If you two have any feelings of friendship, you should accept it. Right now, what's most important is Shirone's mental state."

Nade spoke with an indifferent expression.

"Isn't that the teacher's judgment? I don't think so."

Siena sighed as if frustrated. Insisting stubbornly despite knowing their friend's condition was far from friendship.

"You're saying that because you don't know the terror of overflow. Iruki will surely agree."

"No. I find it strange too. Either way, it's something Shirone should handle himself, isn't it? I don't understand why you're so concerned about it, teacher."

It was a cold thing to say between friends. But this was precisely why they were friends. The fact that Shirone, the person involved, wasn't hurt meant that their way of thinking was ultimately based on the same rationality.

"So you're saying you'd be fine if Shirone went crazy?"

"There's no reason it would be bad. But more than that, I think Shirone can overcome it. Since he's decided to become the best in this field anyway, it's something he has to accept."

Nade picked up the conversation.

"I think the same. Come to think of it, aren't you favoring Shirone too much? We don't mind, but he himself might find it quite burdensome."

Nade thought for a moment, then added with gleaming eyes.

"Among the students, there are even rumors that you see Shirone as a man, teacher."

Of course, no such rumor had ever spread. But this was also the method that worked best on teachers. Siena wasn't easily fooled either. Having clashed with underground research societies for years, she hadn't budged even at worse rumors than this.

"Let's say that's true. Then I suppose I can take charge of Shirone now?"

Even teachers couldn't arbitrarily make students withdraw from research societies unless they violated school rules. In cases like this, the research society president's decision was more important than the administration, making Nade's consent crucial.

"Don't be unreasonable. Then are you saying the rumor about the teacher seeing a student as a man is true?"

"If that's how it looks, then think whatever you want. I won't compromise."

"Really? Then I could date you too?"

Siena shook her head as if she didn't want to even imagine it.

"No, that will absolutely never happen."

"See? Your words are contradictory, teacher. You are favoring Shirone after all."

"Shirone is kind, honest, and popular, so such rumors could spread. But you're not, are you?"

"...Teacher. Is it okay if I get hurt right now?"

"No, it's not. Listen carefully. Trying to trap me like this is useless. Even if you're in the graduating class, I absolutely never see my students as men. But if it means taking Shirone away, I don't mind such misunderstandings. Shirone needs continuous attention. You're the ones being unreasonable."

With Nade speechless, Iruki stepped forward.

"I understand that you're worried, teacher, but if he can't overcome overflow anyway, that's just his limit. It's not like he'll die. Isn't it reasonable to trust Shirone?"

"Not die? If it were any other problem, I wouldn't go this far. But this is Immortal Function. There's no guarantee the worst situation won't occur."

"That may be so. But it hasn't happened yet. I think Teacher Siena is worrying excessively about an uncertain problem. This isn't concernâ€”it's obsession."

"Obsession?"

Siena swallowed hard. She felt as if her inner pain had been exposed. Perhaps Iruki's words weren't wrong. The darkness that had suddenly visited her in her youth had carved a deeper wound in her heart than overflow ever could.

"Listening to this conversation, it seems like this is my problem."

Shirone broke the silence.

"I'm fine. Honestly, it's scary, but more than that, I want to see what happens. How I'll turn out, and whether I can overcome it. Even if I fall into overflow, I'll never resent you for it, teacher."

Shirone's words brought back bittersweet memories for Siena. The person who had saved her from hell had said the same thing.

- Siena. Look straight at whatever is coming toward you. No matter how scary it is, you must not turn away. Closing your eyes won't make it disappear.

- Go away! You don't know anything!

'If only I had had such courage back then...'
