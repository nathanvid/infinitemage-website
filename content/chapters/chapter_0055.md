Perhaps that terrible accident might never have happened. He had been someone as honest and pure as Shirone.

But that person had lost his light. A genius specially cherished by God had lost his light because of his own cowardly self.

"Right. I understand your thoughts well enough."

Siena emerged from her reminiscence.

"I'll respect Shirone's thoughts and won't pressure him to withdraw."

"No, but when will you respect the president's thoughts?"

"Hehe. Do you have time for wordplay? You have one month ahead of you. If you can't produce research results that satisfy the school, the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society will be disbanded. A research society that has produced countless graduates will end with your generation."

Nade's heart sank with a thud. Come to think of it, this wasn't just a matter of being thrown out onto the streets.

The seniors of the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society had broken through the school's evaluation of them as troublemakers and were positioned in key posts throughout magical society. Particularly, the current Magic Association President Michea Gaold had always been a source of pride. If the research society's legacy were to be cut off during their generation, they would have no face to show when they met those seniors in society.

'Ah, this is driving me crazy. What should we do?'

Though she said she was giving them a month, it was nothing more than political rhetoric to disband the research society. Above all, the Supernatural Paranormal Research Society had never officially held a presentation. How could they logically prove the existence of ghosts or gods whose existence was uncertain? Cornered, Nade abandoned all dignity and clung to Siena.

"Teacher! Please give us a chance! Isn't there any other way besides a presentation? You know it too, don't you, teacher? That our research society has significance in its very existence! We're the only research society that can deliver a blow to the magical society that worships only logic!"

Siena didn't even snort in response.

"That's exactly why I'm telling you to try delivering that blow. I can't compromise this time. It's already an agenda item that's gone up to the faculty meeting, so withdrawal is impossible. I hope you make the right decision."

As Siena left the research society, the children slumped onto the sofa at the signal of the iron door closing. Their minds were dazed as if they had woken up from a dream. With clanking sounds, the mechanical device of Estas began returning the research room to its original position.

**Gauge Symmetry (1)**

A leisurely holiday.

Normally, Shirone would be buried in the library even on rest days, but now he sat blankly in the central park. Iruki and Nade also sat beside him in a row, listlessly sucking on juice.

"What time is it now?"

"Don't know. At least it's not night."

"Genius."

An awkward silence followed. When Shirone sighed, two more sighs followed in succession. Finally, unable to bear it, Shirone jumped up and turned to face them, shouting.

"What are we going to do about the research society? Shouldn't we be thinking of presentation topics instead of sitting here like this?"

"Right. Let's think. What kind of research project could we get school approval for?"

Nade shook his head.

"As far as I know, we've never held a presentation. Of course, we've caused many interesting incidents, but the school would never approve such things as official research anyway."

There was no way to elevate the subject of supernatural paranormal science to a professional level. If such a method existed, it would have already spread throughout the world under the name of science.

Shirone, who had sat back down on the bench, also emptied his thoughts. He glanced at the legs of passing female students and occasionally turned his head when he saw a woman with particularly good development, but his mind was actually blank.

"Huh? Hey guys, look over there."

Nade pointed somewhere with an indifferent chin gesture. A beauty they had never seen at school was heading toward the main gate. She wore an ivory trench coat with heels, and her permed violet hair cascaded down to her waist, swaying gracefully.

"Biologically speaking, the design is quite good. Who is she?"

"A graduating class senior? Usually kids our age don't wear such mature clothes, right?"

While his friends were evaluating her, Shirone squinted his eyes and observed carefully. The atmosphere felt familiar somehow.

"Could that be... Teacher Siena?"

"Teacher Siena?"

Nade leaned forward and looked more carefully. It definitely was her. She wasn't wearing glasses and had let down her trademark neatly pinned-up hair, but it was definitely Siena.

"Wow. Amazing. Can a person change that much?"

"Right. With makeup too, she's a completely different person. By the way Shirone, how did you know? Now that I look at you, you have a pretty good eye for women?"

"Huh? No. I just thought it looked like her."

The reason Shirone recognized her at a glance was because he had seen Siena with her hair down. But since he couldn't bring himself to mention that the teacher had visited him late at night, he just mumbled vaguely.

"But where is she going? Even with makeup on."

"Today is the teacher's day off. It's a holiday too. She probably has a date or something."

"Wasn't Teacher Siena far from men?"

"Still, she must have someone she meets. A woman of 26 is at the perfect marriageable age. The teacher should get married too."

"Hmm. That's true..."

As Nade stroked his chin, lost in thought, a light flashed in his eyes as an idea struck his mind.

"Should we follow her? I'm curious."

"What would we do following her? It's the teacher's private life."

"We don't have anything to do anyway. It doesn't seem like we'll find answers just sitting here thinking, and my head feels like it's going to explode. Since it's a holiday, we just need to get back before sunset."

Iruki was skeptical.

"Can we even follow without being caught? She's a certified 6th-grade magician. Even without Spirit Zone, her awareness of surroundings would be different. We'd be caught immediately, right?"

"Then let's do this. Iruki, you track the teacher and Shirone will be the intermediate contact. I'll stop by the research room."

Shirone caught onto Nade's thinking.

"The invisibility cloak?"

"Exactly that. If we tail her wearing the invisibility cloak, even the teacher won't notice. She has no reason to deploy Spirit Zone while going on a date. How about it?"

"That's a good idea. Alright, then I'll start following from now. Shirone, you bring Nade from the middle."

As Iruki sprang up from the bench and chased after Siena, Shirone sighed. These kids really had outstanding execution when it came to things like this.

"Then I'll go get the invisibility cloak. Shirone, you absolutely cannot lose Iruki. You can move while checking points, right?"

Since the city's directionality is constrained by artificial structures called roads, one could grasp the approximate movement route by just checking points. Since they couldn't get too far from Nade either, judging the return point from the midpoint was important.

Shirone reluctantly nodded. He hated himself for already having the calculations finished in his head even in this situation.

"Got it. But come quickly. I'm not confident about more than 10 minutes."

"Haha! As expected, Shirone! I'm counting on you!"

Nade ran to the research society, and Shirone, who had tailed Iruki, returned after 10 minutes to pick up Nade at the main gate. From then they ran quickly and were able to catch up with Iruki after another 10 minutes. When the two came running, Iruki shook his head with a troubled expression.

"This is strange."

"Why? Did you lose the teacher?"

"No. But I almost lost her. She's being unusually vigilant about her surroundings. I thought it was a battlefield."

"Oho. This is getting more and more interesting. Could she be pocketing money with forbidden goods like us?"

Shirone looked at Nade with disdain.

"The teacher wouldn't do such things."

"Anyway, let's go first. Now that we have the invisibility cloak, we can get closer."

The three put on the invisibility cloak and pursued Siena. As they entered the commoner district, the streets were bustling with people who had come out to do business since early dawn. Thanks to this, tailing became much easier.

The place where Siena stopped was a two-story house. The three stuck their faces out from under the cloak and watched to see who would open the door. But when Siena looked around, their faces popped back in like turtles. The three's hearts pounded.

"She's being too vigilant, isn't she? Who lives in this house that she's acting like this? It's just a common commoner house."

Captivated by curiosity, the three stuck their faces out again. Since they hadn't committed any crime, there seemed no need to freeze up.

A young man opened the door and came out. And as soon as he saw Siena, they shared a deep embrace.

"That, that can't be...!"

Shirone's group was shocked without exception. The nickname "Siena of Ice" meant her specialty, but it was also given because of her personality of treating any man coldly. But to think she had a hidden man. The three looked at each other's faces and realized this was reality.

"How did this happen? It was definitely a man, right?"

"We'll know if we go see. Let's follow them inside."

Shirone said in surprise.

"What? But how can we enter someone else's house?"

"But it's a bit much to just go back like this. We need to know what we need to know for sure."

"The teacher is single, so naturally she can meet men. Why are you making such a fuss?"

Iruki's thoughts were different. Judging from all the circumstances so far, there were more than one or two strange points.

"Something smells fishy. There's no problem with the teacher meeting a man. But why did she hide it? She's officially single at school too. Plus, being vigilant about the surroundings is also concerning."

"Exactly that. That's why I'm saying let's check it out."

Shirone asked with an anxious expression.

"What are you planning to do?"

"We can enter through the basement storage. Don't worry. Even if we get caught, what big trouble could happen? Since Teacher Siena went in anyway, it's not like it's a complete stranger's house."

Shirone stared blankly with his mouth open.

"That's... an extremely subjective way of thinking on our part, isn't it?"

"I don't know. Anyway, I'm going. I'm going crazy with curiosity."

When Nade and Iruki left their seats, Shirone also sighed and followed behind them. Though he didn't like the appearance of going along with them, if he left the two alone, he didn't know what they might do.

Arriving at the entrance going down to the basement storage, Nade examined the iron door. It was installed horizontally and firmly locked.

Taking out a device similar to a ballpoint pen from his pocket, when he pressed the button, a sharp iron needle popped out. It was one of Nade's patented items, a lock-picking device.

To open a lock, one must accurately press the internal mechanism's irregularities, and Nade's device could adjust the iron core in units of 1/100th of a centimeter, so it could easily pick commoner houses.

After inserting the device into the lock, Nade made various attempts with his tongue sticking out, then the moment he twisted his wrist, the lock clicked open.

When the door opened and a ladder going down to the basement became visible, Shirone fell into a sense of futility.

Just because there was a locking device, people felt secure spending the night, but they seemed to forget that locking devices were also made by humans.

Going down the ladder, the characteristic onion scent of a food storage stimulated their nostrils. While Shirone closed the iron door, Nade put his ear to the door leading to the first floor and observed the outside situation.

"Good. The first floor is quiet too. Let's go up once."

The three people covered by the invisibility cloak headed to the first floor looking like ghosts with only their faces floating. There was an integrated living room and kitchen floor, but no people. Going up the stairs to the second floor, they could feel signs of people from the room at the end of the corridor. Siena's voice was heard.

"What are you doing? Hurry up."

When Shirone and Nade moved their facial muscles dramatically, Iruki put his hand to his lips. A man's voice followed.

"Wait a minute. I'm not ready yet. Take off your clothes first."

"When will your wife return?"

"She went to the market to shop. It'll probably take more than two hours."

Nade couldn't control his excitement again. No, beyond excitement, he was making an expression close to shock.

Shirone felt similar emotions. He had never dreamed that the man Teacher Siena was meeting would be a married man.
