"Aren't you going to wear it today?"

"Yeah. Try straightening your back a little more."

"Like this?"

"Yes, like that. Lift your legs slightly. Yes, that's right."

All three of their faces turned bright red. Of course, as adults, romantic feelings between men and women were understandable. But this was adultery. If the school found out, Siena's teaching career would be over.

"Shall we begin then? Don't move."

"Don't worry. I've been holding still well so far."

Nade looked back at his friends with an angry expression. Shirone and Iruki, who guessed what he was about to do, also nodded their heads.

They say love knows no borders, but thinking of the wife whose husband had been stolen, it was right to end this here.

Nade's hand gripping the door handle was trembling. If they waited just a little longer, they could gather perfect evidence, but he didn't want to see such a sight from a teacher he had respected.

The door handle turned roughly and all three rushed into the room without hesitation.

"You scoundrel! Ms. Siena! I'm truly disappointed!"

Nade's shout was buried in silence.

Shirone and Iruki, who had been preparing to close their eyes, stared blankly at the scene in the room, which was completely different from what they had imagined.

Siena, sitting on the bed, turned toward the door. Across from her stood a large canvas.

"Huh? Huh?"

Shirone's group opened and closed their mouths like fish. One thought crossed everyone's mind. This was an incident involving tremendous misunderstanding, misconception, and distortion all at once.

"What? How did you guys get here...?"

Siena was equally surprised. When her students suddenly entered her private space, her face turned red. But the embarrassment was brief, and soon she frowned.

"Don't tell me you followed me?"

"What? No, well. The thing is, we were just sitting in the park spacing out, you know? Then Ms. Siena suddenly walked by. So we..."

"So you did follow me!"

"Eek! We're sorry!"

Shirone's group simultaneously shrank their necks. Given her personality, it wouldn't end with just a scolding. But contrary to expectations, no more sparks flew. When they cautiously opened their eyes, they saw Siena lost in thought.

'How exactly did they follow me?'

She had been as careful as possible, staying alert to her surroundings. While she hadn't entered her Spirit Zone, her eyes weren't so dull that mere students could tail her.

"What are you hiding behind you? Bring it here."

Nade shook his head with a terrified expression. But when something like killing intent emerged from Siena's eyes, he hurriedly held out the cloak he was carrying. Siena snatched it fiercely and made a dumbfounded expression when she saw her own arm disappear. When she wrapped it around her waist like a skirt, this time her body appeared severed from the waist down.

"Nade. Is this another one of your patent products?"

"Yes."

"You really made this yourself?"

"B-but I didn't put it on the black market! I do have that much conscience!"

"Sigh."

All three shoulders flinched at Siena's sigh. But she didn't continue nagging. As a certified 6th-grade mage, being tailed was more due to her own inexperience than her students' wrongdoing.

"But why did you come into this room? Knowing you'd obviously get caught? And what did you mean about being disappointed?"

Shirone spoke with a trembling voice.

"At first we were just following you as a prank, but then we saw you hugging a man and followed you inside. When we eavesdropped on the conversation outside the door, we thought you were committing adultery and..."

"What? A-adultery?"

Siena's face turned as red as a beet. It was the first time they had seen her so flustered.

"Adultery! How could you think such a thing about me!"

Nade shot back defiantly.

"But it's true! How could we not misunderstand after hearing that conversation? Telling someone to take off their clothes, to try this position. Just who is that person anyway?"

Nade pointed to the man still hiding behind the canvas.

"You mean me?"

Following the warm voice, they heard the sound of a chair scraping. Shortly after, the man revealed himself from behind the canvas.

Shirone's group wore blank expressions. He was a handsome man in his late twenties with golden hair grown to his waist. But the real reason for their surprise wasn't his good looks. They could see shabby cloth wrapped around both of the man's eyes. He was blind. And he was a painter.

'What?'

Shirone's face went pale. The supersensory perception he felt every night began to envelop his entire body again.

'Why now? At a time like this. This has never happened during the day.'

His hair stood on end and his bones felt frozen. As he grabbed his trembling wrist and took a deep breath, Nade, feeling somewhat responsible, patted his back.

"Hey, Shirone? Are you okay? Don't worry too much. Surely the teacher wouldn't kill us, right?"

"Huh? Oh, no. I'm fine now."

Shirone gradually regained his composure. It had been an intense cold incomparable to his usual supersensory perception, but precisely because of that intensity, it also disappeared quickly.

"Siena, stop it and forgive them. I don't know what the situation is, but they seem like students you're teaching."

"What are you saying? That makes it even more unforgivable. Following me is one thing, but they broke into someone else's house. They only learn bad things."

The man smiled kindly.

"But they're your students. They probably thought it was okay since their teacher was in the house."

Nade, seizing the opportunity for redemption, interjected.

"Haha! We actually thought exactly that. Really. Ask Shirone since he doesn't lie. If it had just been someone else's house, we never would have entered. We're not petty thieves."

Shirone nodded repeatedly.

"That's right. Nade really said that to me. I heard it clearly."

Siena held her head as if she had a headache. The way they sparkled their innocent eyes trying to save themselves was almost disgusting.

'Such innocent kids doing something like this? Really cunning little...'

Using an invisibility cloak to tail a teacher while hidden, picking the lock of someone else's house and enteringâ€”this was absolutely not something they should be saying.

Even with the situation having come to this, the man only smiled. More than anything, he was happy to meet Siena's students.

"I'm Armin. Siena and I have been like siblings since childhood. I also studied at the Oliver School."

When Armin extended his hand, Nade quickly grasped it.

"Ah, I see. We apologize for our foolish misunderstanding. And we're sorry for visiting so suddenly without notice."

Siena shouted fiercely.

"It's breaking and entering! Now you're trying to subtly change it to visiting?"

"Hehe. That's why we said we're sorry. Honestly, we're also happy that our misunderstanding about Ms. Siena has been cleared up."

"I'm sorry, teacher. I had such a strange misunderstanding."

Siena put her hands on her hips and snorted. Since encountering her students in a private setting was awkward for her as well, silence continued for a while.

"Sit down and let's talk. I'll bring some tea first."

Armin tactfully vacated his spot. When the man who couldn't see left through the door with precise steps, Shirone's group had no choice but to be amazed once again.

"Teacher, who is that person? And what did you mean earlier about taking off clothes? That's why we misunderstood."

Siena shook her head as if the suspicion was absurd.

"Armin is like an older brother to me and my fellow alumnus. He was also someone who gathered expectations as the greatest genius in Oliver School's history. He's a painter now, but his talent was far superior to mine from childhood."

"He sounds like an amazing person. But if I may ask, what happened to his eyes...?"

When Siena's expression darkened, Nade flinched, thinking he had asked an inappropriate question. But fortunately, she soon relaxed her expression and spoke calmly.

"He lost his sight to save me."

"What? Because of you, teacher?"

"When I was about 9 years old, I fell into Overflow. As I vaguely began to understand the principles of the world, everything became frightening. I think I cried every day. Even thinking about it now, it was truly terrible suffering."

Siena smiled bitterly.

"The person who saved me was Armin. He led me from darkness into light. At that time, Armin was 11 years old."

Even at 11, he was still just a child. Yet the fact that he had rescued Siena from Overflow showed what an outstanding talent Armin was.

"So you overcame Overflow with Mr. Armin's advice."

Siena shook her head.

"No. I wasn't that strong a child. I was an arrogant little brat who lived enjoying privileges just because I was from the Oliver family. Back then, I disliked him. He would always tell me the same thing like a mantra. He'd say that whatever approaches you, you must not turn your eyes away from it. Every time he said that, I got annoyed. I'd close my eyes because I was scared. I had no choice but to run away because I couldn't bear it. Heh. Looking back, I was really foolish then."

Shirone couldn't imagine Siena, a certified 6th-grade mage, crying in terror.

"Then how did you overcome Overflow?"

"Because I hated Armin coming to find me, I would go out to mountains, fields, or riversides. Armin would easily find me, but each time I would run away again. As this game of tag continued, one day... an incident happened."

Siena painfully frowned.

"It was the rainy season and it had been raining for several days. Even on such gloomy days, I was wandering around the riverside. Looking back, maybe it would have just passed by normally. But coincidentally, the dam blocking the upstream collapsed. I, who was downstream, was swept away by the flood waters without knowing anything. It was such a tremendous flood that it could have flooded half the village."

Siena recalled the events from 17 years ago.

She couldn't even scream before being submerged in the river. When she desperately struggled to surface, the scenery was completely different from the riverside where she had been. Building debris and livestock were floating down from upstream, while sharp broken trees were bobbing around downstream.

For the first time in her life, Siena tasted the terror of death.

'Please save me. Someone, please...!'

She knew no one would come. This place, far from the school, was an intermediate zone between streams and marshes where people never ventured. It had now become a river, but no one would think a young girl would be here.

The water quickly swelled her body. The land seemed impossibly far away for crossing. The small stream where she used to pick up pebbles had transformed into a 25-meter-wide torrential rapid. The water was pitch black, and as the current split against rocks, countless whirlpools formed.

"Help! Someone please save me!"

For the first time in her life, Siena showed a pathetic side. Her pride as the only daughter of Oliver, one of the continent's ten great schools, lost its authority before the power of nature. Even her natural talent couldn't overcome the raging river. All she could do was cry for help.

"Siena!"

As if hearing a divine revelation, Siena used all her strength to lift her head. On a tree branch precariously bent over the river, Armin was waiting.

"Brother! Brother!"

"Give me your hand!"

Armin reached down close to the water's surface. Just as Siena was about to grab his hand, she was suddenly swept underwater by a surge.

"Siena!"

When Siena resurfaced, it wasn't her face but her legs that appeared first. Armin didn't hesitate to dive in. Swimming rapidly with the current, he grabbed Siena and brought her face above water. Having swallowed water, Siena wasn't in her right mind.

"Gasp! Gasp!"

"Siena! Get a hold of yourself! We need to get out of the river!"

"Sa-save me! Save me!"

They had escaped the whirlpool zone, but more dangerous obstacles awaited them. Armin expanded his Spirit Zone to navigate around the obstacles. It was the only method available to an 11-year-old.
