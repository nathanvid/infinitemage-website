"Siena! Open your eyes properly! Get a grip!"

"Brother! P-please, save me...!"

Siena was in no state to regain her composure. But it was impossible for two young people to cross the river with their physical abilities alone. Armin realized he had to do it by himself.

'I just need to reach the Delphons region. From there it becomes a delta and the water volume will decrease. At our current speed, we should arrive in about 20 minutes.'

Twenty minutes? It felt like an eternity. Could he survive 20 minutes in the rapids while carrying the delirious Siena?

'Don't be stupid. I have no choice.'

Armin steeled his resolve. The scene before his eyes felt grotesquely distorted. Broken logs were flowing downstream. He twisted his body with all his might. Even when muddy water entered his eyes, even when massive rocks bore down on him, even when sharp branches cut across his skin, he kept moving through reality.

'Just a little... just a little more!'

He could feel Siena's tiny hand pinching his waist. The feeling of a fragile life depending entirely on him was wretched, but an even greater sense of mission awakened his spirit.

After what felt like hellish eternity, he began to see their destination far downstream. But there was no visible path to reach it. A broken tree had fallen toward the river, blocking their way.

"Siena, listen carefully. We need to avoid that. The only way is to go underwater. I'm going to push you down. Hold your breath tight, endure it, then come back up. Got it?"

"Brother! I'm scared! I can't do it!"

"You have to. You can do it. Trust me!"

"Brother! Brothâ€”!"

As they entered where two whirlpools intersected, the current's speed more than doubled. Caught off guard by the unexpected situation, Armin gritted his teeth. With only his neck above water, the flood's debris came charging at him like monsters.

Armin kicked so hard his legs cramped up. Sharp objects scraped past his body. Having bled continuously and with his body temperature dropping, his consciousness was becoming hazy. Meanwhile, they reached the tree blocking their path. Even examining it up close, there was still no way except to go underwater.

"Siena! Here we go!"

Armin glared at the approaching tree, timing it perfectly. Just before collision, he pressed down hard on Siena's shoulder.

"Now!"

Siena's screaming voice was swallowed by the water. As Armin surfaced while pushing Siena down, the sharp bark of the waterlogged trunk magnified in his vision. But all his nerves were focused on the hand pressing down on Siena. And the moment she passed under the trunk, he released his grip.

'I did it! Success!'

Armin smiled faintly as he looked at the trunk approaching him. He was glad he could save Siena. And even until that moment, he did not close his eyes.

"Brotherrrrr!"

Siena's voice, drifting downstream, could be heard faintly.

That was where Siena's story ended. The children bowed their heads with solemn hearts.

"I drifted down to the Delphons region and was rescued by the villagers. Thanks to escaping the forest area, there were no dangerous structures, and unconscious Brother Armin also drifted down to where I was. The school faction dispatched people for treatment, but the diagnosis was permanent eye damage. Brother lost his sight after that."

"I see. You two had such a story..."

"Brother taught me firsthand how to overcome fear. Thanks to that, I was able to overcome Overflow. But Brother lost his light. The greatest talent in the school's history... came to a stop like that."

Shirone felt heavy-hearted. For a human, losing one's eyes was tantamount to losing almost everything. He couldn't read books, and learning magic would inevitably be limited. He could imagine without seeing how disappointed and anguished Armin must have been.

"I heard Brother came to this place three years ago and met him then. He said he was developing a painting style that captures light. So I volunteered to be his model."

"I see. Without knowing any of this, we made such a thoughtless misunderstanding..."

The fact that they had misunderstood the two's relationship as an affair was itself disrespectful behavior toward them. Just as the atmosphere was about to darken, Armin came out carrying tea and refreshments.

"Did I interrupt? It's rare for Siena to bring up old stories."

"Brother."

"First, have some tea. It's nothing special, but it contains my wife's secret recipe, so it should suit your taste."

"Ah, thank you. We'll gratefully partake."

Shirone's group received the teacups with humble postures. Though he had switched to being a painter, he was someone who had shown genius talent in magic from 20 years ago. While they could blame his unfortunate fate, as aspiring mages, they could not look down on Armin.

Armin returned to the canvas and offered them seats behind him.

"Well then, I should get back to work. Would you guests mind waiting over here?"

"Ah, yes. Of course."

The three moved their positions awkwardly with teacups in hand. As Siena took her pose on the bed, Nade asked hesitantly.

"Um, I'm really sorry for asking this, but you're not drawing a nude painting, are you?"

Now that they knew Armin was a painter, whatever art he practiced was none of their business. However, he thought Siena might find it awkward to do such things in front of students.

"Hahaha! Even though I'm blind, I couldn't make unreasonable requests of my precious little sister."

"But I heard earlier that you asked her to take off her clothes..."

"Ah, that's this. Siena, could you show them once?"

Siena opened the wardrobe and took out a coat made of silver foil. The light reflection made it so dazzling that it was difficult even to look at. Shirone shielded his eyes with his hand.

"Wow! That's really bright."

"I can't see objects precisely with just Spirit Zone. So I coat figures and objects with luminous materials to feel the light. In that sense, the silver foil coat is a very good tool."

"How unique. Drawing pictures by feeling light."

"Instead of losing my eyes, I can draw things other painters can't. But today is the last time I'll draw Siena. A good patron has appeared, so I need to move within a few days. That's why I wanted to capture Siena's natural feeling. Wearing the coat seems to diminish her beauty."

Siena's cheeks turned slightly red.

"Brother really... saying such nonsensical things."

"Haha! What's wrong with that? In my mind, you're still a nine-year-old little kid."

"I get it, so hurry up and work. You won't be able to work when Kaira comes back."

Shirone's group fidgeted their fingers and toes at the subtle and ticklish atmosphere. They were clearly like siblings, but they weren't blood relatives. Perhaps the reason Siena had reacted more violently than usual to the affair comment was because she still harbored some lingering feelings for Armin.

"Then I'll start. Since I'm drawing by feeling, it'll finish earlier than usual."

As Siena took a modest pose, Armin picked up charcoal and began sketching the rough outline. Watching from behind, Shirone's group was amazed by his skill. Though he seemed to be drawing casually, his lines perfectly traced Siena's contours.

"Wow! Amazing."

"Shh."

Iruki raised his index finger to caution Nade. Not being able to see was a fatal disadvantage for a painter, so much more concentration than usual would be required.

But Shirone tilted his head. It was really strange. Even without luminous materials, Armin was accurately transferring even Siena's detailed features to the canvas.

'How is this possible? Does that mean his Spirit Zone density is that high? Even if that's the case, this level of detail...'

If Spirit Zone had considerable density, precise drawing might be possible through synesthesia. It was like the principle of footprints being imprinted in mud. But he knew that even Ethella, who was a Zoner, hadn't reached that level.

The drawing became even more precise. Siena was wearing a beautiful smile rarely seen at school. Armin used bread like an eraser to perfectly implement that smile on the canvas.

Shirone inwardly exclaimed in admiration. He had heard that one of the most difficult things for a painter to express was lips. This was because the feeling changed according to subtle changes in the corners of the mouth.

'I see. This is impossible.'

No matter how high the Spirit Zone density, it didn't make sense for a blind painter to catch such details. With that thought, he got goosebumps as his supersensory perception revived again.

"Excuse me... Mr. Armin."

"Yes?"

Armin smiled and turned his head slightly. Shirone hesitated briefly about whether it was okay to ask such a question. If he had guessed wrong, it would be a great discourtesy to him.

"By any chance, are you..."

But he couldn't bear not asking. The chilling cold of his supersensory perception was penetrating to his bones.

"Can you actually see?"

Armin's hand, still smiling, stopped abruptly. He calmly set down the charcoal and turned to look at Shirone.

"Yes. I can see."

Shirone was speechless. Could he really see? But then why didn't Siena know?

Armin, who had turned completely toward Shirone, untied the cloth covering his eyes. Around his covered eyes were carved countless scars.

'He's definitely injured, but how can he see? No, wait, he was covering his eyes from the beginning? But saying he can see, what exactly...'

"You must have many questions about me. I'll show you directly."

When Armin slowly opened his eyes, Shirone's breath stopped. There were no pupils. Though it was inadequate to call it a replacement, the empty eye sockets were filled with bright light.

"Nade, Iruki! Do you see that? Huh?"

In his urgency, Shirone hit Nade's thigh. But the sensation transmitted through his hand was strange. A hardness like touching an object. He turned his head to examine his friends and jumped up with a horrified expression.

"This is impossible! How?"

Nade wasn't moving at all. Iruki was also looking at the canvas with a smiling expression. He hurriedly moved to check on Siena, but it was the same. Like wax figures, they were just staying there, frozen solid. Armin approached behind the confused Shirone.

"It's been a long time since a guest visited my room."

"Don't tell me, this is...?"

"Yes. That's right. It's magic called Stop."

Shirone turned around with a dumbfounded expression. Stop was magic only possible for mages who could manipulate light speed, and throughout history, those who had reached this level could be counted on one hand. In short, he was experiencing the absolute realm of time magic.

"Please sit. Let's talk calmly. We have plenty of time."

"Haha..."

Shirone laughed awkwardly. If time had indeed stopped, time could be said to be infinite.

"Actually, I was nervous while painting. I didn't know when you would enter this time barrier."

"How did you know I would notice?"

Armin pointed to the light embedded in his eye sockets.

"The organ called eyes receives light and reconstructs it into visual information. But I, who have no eyes, feel the world as light itself. This is quite a terrible experience. The forms of objects that ordinary people perceive look completely different to me."

"It's the Idea."

There was no guarantee that human senses accepted truth. Perhaps bricks might be soft like jelly. Fire might be cold, and a lover's sweet kiss might involve pain.

"Let me introduce myself properly. I am Armin of the Light Eye. Among those who know me, I'm called the Eternal Contemplator."

"But Mr. Armin, when you were young, you lost your magic..."

"Yes. It was an unfortunate accident. After leaving the Olifer School, I wandered the world aimlessly for 15 years. A world of nothing but darkness."
