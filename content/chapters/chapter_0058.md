Armin recalled that time.

"Not being able to see is like space disappearing. When space disappears, even time vanishes. That's when I realized it in the darkness—that my existence had already transcended time. That's how the Stop magic was completed."

Shirone's heart pounded. He felt like he had heard the essence of Stop magic that countless time mages had failed to conquer.

"It's nothing to be so amazed about. It's not exactly a transcendental ability. It's only possible within the radius of the Spirit Zone and has considerable limitations."

Armin looked back at Siena, frozen in time.

"She's a good girl. As much as she pretends to be strong, she has a tender heart. Don't you think so too, Shirone?"

"Haha! Well, I'm not sure about tender, but she's definitely a good person."

"How does she look now? Is my sister beautiful?"

"Oh, of course. She's very popular at school too."

"Then what do you think? If time were stopped, could we do inappropriate things?"

Understanding Armin's words, Shirone's face flushed red.

"What are you talking about? Don't tell me you, Armin..."

"Don't worry. It's impossible. Currently, we exist in a state where our mass converges to zero. If we actually had no mass, we'd disintegrate, but the point is acceleration. That's why Stop magic is called the realm of light speed."

"That's why Nade felt hard when I touched him. Without mass, I couldn't even wrinkle his collar."

"Exactly. We become infinitely weak. But it's also true that no one can touch us. That's the true meaning of Stop magic. You asked how I knew you'd notice? Simple. I gained the same realization as you, Shirone."

"The same realization... don't tell me?"

"Yes. Immortal Function."

Shirone's heart pounded. Here before him was someone who had directly experienced Immortal Function, which no one had ever explained to him. And he was a supreme mage of the time element.

"Immortal Function is a realization about essence. Since essence is one, your wavelength and mine resonate. It's also called supersensory perception."

"What exactly is Immortal Function?"

"You could call it a gateway to infinity. You've opened it, Shirone. In the magical community, such people are called unlockers."

Armin thought for a moment before asking a question.

"By any chance... when you opened Immortal Function, didn't you feel like your ego was dissolving?"

"Yes! I really thought I was going to disappear."

"You would have if it had continued. When the mind transcends the end of numbers, the Spirit Zone expands infinitely. But humans are finite beings. That's why unlockers accept infinity through their unique Spirit Zones."

After hearing the explanation, Shirone said with a worried expression:

"Then what about me? Even the greatest mages are careful about it, but at the time I knew nothing. That's why I have nightmares every night and feel supersensory perception even when I'm alone."

Armin reassured Shirone with a gentle smile.

"It's a natural progression. If you could control it from the start, you wouldn't have opened Immortal Function. The supersensory perception is what you feel toward yourself. Because you don't yet know what realization you gained through that enormous expansion."

"How can I find out?"

"You'll realize it naturally. You're just in a state where you can't name what you've already obtained."

"But..."

Seeing Shirone's still anxious face, Armin recalled his past self. Well, no matter how much he said you'd realize it naturally, it wouldn't feel real.

"Alright. Then I'll tell you. What Shirone has realized is called gauge symmetry."

"Gauge... symmetry?"

"This world should be perfectly balanced. But in reality, symmetry is broken. Shirone directly experienced that discrepancy. That's probably the cause of your supersensory perception."

Shirone kept repeating the words "gauge symmetry" like an incantation. But nothing came to mind like magic.

Armin patted Shirone's head and said:

"You don't need to worry about anything. That doesn't mean you shouldn't do anything, but Shirone will eventually reach it. When that time comes, you'll understand what I mean."

Shirone took a deep breath and nodded. His mind wasn't organized yet, but he could tell that today's meeting would be a huge turning point in his future.

"Thank you so much. If I hadn't met you, Armin, I might have fallen into Overflow like Teacher Siena said."

"Unlockers share a deep bond as much as they share the same wavelength. Of course, that bond sometimes leads to big fights. Anyway, I'm glad I could help."

Armin looked at Siena with an affectionate smile.

"I think it's time to leave the room of time. I need to finish the painting before my wife returns."

"Ah, come to think of it, you said today was the last day?"

"Yes. I have a grand title, but my main job is as a painter. I'm planning to pack up and leave within a few days starting today. I won't be able to see Siena for a while."

"Wouldn't it be better to tell the teacher..."

Armin shook his head.

"Siena is still suffering. Even if I hadn't given up magic, my lost eyes won't grow back. Besides, I'm already married. I want to help Siena live her own life."

Shirone understood Armin's feelings. He didn't want to see his sister, whom he treasured more than his own life, bound to the past.

"Yes. I'll keep the secret too. Thank you so much for today."

"I enjoyed it too, Shirone."

Armin covered his eyes with cloth again. As he returned to his canvas, time began to flow. Nade and Iruki's breathing could be heard, and life returned to Siena's smile.

Shirone felt like he had awakened from a dream. He could hardly believe he had been having a conversation with Armin just moments before.

Time passed quickly in his elevated emotions. Armin, having completed the painting, turned the canvas toward Siena.

"How is it? Does it look good?"

"Yes, it's pretty."

"You worked hard all this time. It was an honor to paint you."

"Oh, brother. It's not like we're strangers..."

A wistful emotion flashed through Siena's eyes. Then, hearing footsteps from downstairs, she jumped up in surprise without time for farewells. Was his wife already back? It was earlier than usual, but she wasn't in the right mind to think deeply about it.

"Brother, I'll be going now. You guys come out quickly too."

Siena tried to leave as if fleeing. Shirone's group felt hurt seeing her, who was more confident than anyone at school, become frightened just because Armin's wife was coming.

"Honey, are you painting?"

Kaira poked her head out. Contrary to expectations that she would be as calm as Armin's personality, she was a lively woman in her early twenties. She made a surprised expression when her eyes met Siena's.

"Oh my, Siena? Come to think of it, today was the day you were coming."

"Hello, Kaira. It's been a while."

"It has. Why is it so hard to see your face? You're not avoiding me on purpose, are you? Ho ho ho!"

Siena held onto her confused mind.

"Ah, I finished working with brother. I was about to leave."

"Since you're here, what's the rush? Have dinner before you go."

"Thank you for the offer, but I have an appointment..."

"Hmm. This is suspicious. Honey, you didn't do anything suspicious with Siena while I was gone, did you?"

"Kaira, watch your words."

Armin's brow furrowed. Even Shirone thought it was inappropriate. The teacher had been careful with her conduct from beginning to end, yet she was suggesting something suspicious.

Siena's face flushed as she left the room, barely putting on her coat. Shirone's group, also upset, glared at Kaira as they followed. But whether oblivious or good-natured, Kaira smiled and waved her hand.

"Take care, little ones. Next time you come, big sister will make something delicious."

Naturally, no response came. At their cold attitude, Kaira tilted her head and muttered:

"Oh my? Did I make some mistake? Why do they look like that? Don't tell me honey really did something strange here?"

"Stop joking and come down. I want to say goodbye properly."

"Tsk. You really can't help yourself when it comes to your sister."

Armin quickly went downstairs. Siena, thinking this wasn't quite right either, was waiting outside the door.

"Sorry, Siena. My wife is quite a chatterbox."

"It's fine. Anyway, now that we're parting, I don't know when we'll see each other again. Take care until then. Stay healthy."

"You too. Work hard. I'm relieved to see you getting along well with your students. Honestly, I was worried whether you could do well. Hahaha!"

Siena burst into laughter. Armin was probably the only person in the world who could treat her like a child. He was the only one who shared memories of her foolish childhood days.

Shirone's heart felt warm. He now had a vague understanding of why a genius recognized by the Kingdom had decided to become a teacher, why she had been so obsessed with Overflow, and why she had kept men at a distance even earning the nickname Siena of Ice.

"Well, I'll be going. Write if you have time."

"I will. I'll let you know once I settle down. And Shirone, Nade, Iruki—work hard. I'll be listening from afar for news of you growing into excellent mages."

"Yes. We're sorry about today."

Shirone's group expressed their sincere gratitude. If not for Armin's consideration, things wouldn't have ended so peacefully.

Armin stayed there until Siena's figure disappeared. Then Kaira, who had been leaning against the door with her arms crossed, spoke with a cold expression:

"Armin, snap out of it. If those upstairs find out you're indulging in sentimentality, who knows what might happen."

Armin also turned to Kaira with an unpleasant expression. They had lived as a fake married couple for three years, but she was truly a woman he couldn't grow fond of.

"Whatever emotions I have are my own business. Just make your mission report. Is the investigation finished?"

"Perfect. There's no more business in Creas. We need to go to Calvera within the next 15 days. We'll have to pass through dangerous territory, but with Armin of the Light Eye, it shouldn't be a problem, right?"

"No need to be long-winded. I'll keep my promise."

Armin said curtly, but Kaira wasn't reassured. Though headquarters had recruited him for his excellent insight and genius magical skills, he was a free-spirited man who could leave the organization at any time.

"You didn't tell Siena anything, did you?"

Armin didn't answer.

"I don't want to harm you. Of course, I know there's no way to capture the Eternal Contemplator, but you're still human. The moment you betray the organization, everyone you love will experience hell. Siena, of course, and even the Olifer School."

It was a chilling threat, and it was also true. The organization Kaira belonged to had enough power, authority, and cruelty to do so and more.

He had to protect Siena no matter what. In that sense, meeting Shirone was fortunate. Today's unexpected variable that no one anticipated would someday lead the situation favorably.

"You don't need to worry."

Armin looked back at Kaira and smiled.

"Siena knows nothing."

## Siena Under the Moonlight (1)

Shirone's group returning to school nervously watched Siena's mood.

The atmosphere had been fine when they were with Armin, but they never knew when her feelings might change.
