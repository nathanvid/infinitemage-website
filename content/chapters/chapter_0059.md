But Siena walked in silence, simply staring at the ground.

Shirone felt heavy-hearted seeing her dejected appearance.

If not for that childhood accident, she might have developed a good relationship with Armin.

But he couldn't blame Armin for hastily getting married. To ease his beloved younger sister's guilt, he had chosen to leave Siena's side of his own accord.

Nade grumbled with displeasure.

"Tch. I really can't understand relationships between men and women."

"It can't be helped. Not everything in the world goes according to our wishes."

"Damn it! She was so cold at school, but honestly, I don't want to see her like this."

Clenching both fists in indignation, Nade quickened his pace and approached Siena.

"Teacher."

"Huh? Yes?"

"We're hungry. Since we're already out, please buy us a meal."

Siena looked bewildered. The breaking and entering they had committed today was serious enough to warrant disciplinary action from the school. And yet here they were, brazenly asking her to buy them food.

"You really have some nerve. Can you actually eat in this situation?"

"What's wrong with that? Even if we get disciplined, we still need to fill our stomachs. We're learning magic to make a living anyway."

Shirone chimed in.

"That's right, teacher. Let's eat before going back. I'm hungry too."

Iruki spoke up.

"In that spirit, I'd like to make a suggestion—we should head to the noble district. The school's close by anyway, and I know a very delicious and expensive restaurant there."

Siena lost even the will to be annoyed. Her students' attitude was so natural, but she had a vague sense of why they were acting this way. She didn't want to return to school in this mood either. It was a holiday, after all.

"Fine, I get it. You must be tired from your mischief, so let's eat first. But once we return to school, you'd better be prepared."

"Hehe! Yes!"

Nade winked at his friends. While his primary goal was to cheer up Siena, he had also calculated the benefit of buying time to possibly mitigate their punishment.

The noble district was lined with all sorts of luxurious shops. Iruki led Siena to the most splendid establishment. Standing before the six-story building, Shirone's jaw dropped.

As befitting a place frequented by successful nobles, even the entrance was extraordinary. Pillars carved from entire ivory tusks supported the balcony ceiling, and marble sculptures of mythical divine beasts stood guard on either side like sentinels.

Restaurant Gold Cupid.

It was the finest restaurant where every dish came with a premium price.

"Wow! I've never been here either. We're really going to live it up today. Shirone, let's hurry inside."

"Uh? Well, um..."

Shirone glanced at Siena. As expected, she was looking up at the sign with a sour smile. It was the most expensive restaurant in the vicinity, so her reaction was understandable. Most importantly, Iruki wouldn't have chosen such a place unless he intended to make their teacher pay through the nose.

But Siena didn't get angry. Instead, she sighed as if resigned and walked briskly toward the entrance.

"Alright. Let's eat here."

"Ooh! Our teacher! You really have exceptional generosity!"

Iruki joined in with Nade's flattery.

"Don't be foolish. It would be problematic to judge our teacher's generosity by this standard. A certified 6th-grade magician can enter and exit a place like this as easily as a bathroom. Isn't that right, teacher?"

"Enough, just hurry up and go inside. But we're only eating and then going straight back to school."

Shirone, experiencing a noble-exclusive restaurant for the first time, was amazed by the scale revealed from the moment he crossed the threshold. As if by magic, the size seen from outside was completely different from the size seen inside.

Tables were sparsely scattered to what seemed like a wasteful degree, and on one side was a bar decorated with crystal chandeliers of various colors.

Naturally, the customers were nobles, and judging by the jewelry they wore, they were clearly among Creas's elite.

"Shirone! Over here!"

Lost in wonder, Shirone headed to the table at his friends' call. Nade and Iruki also looked around occasionally, but they didn't seem nervous.

A waiter approached to take their order. He had slicked-back hair and a greasy appearance, and his rather sticky gaze toward Siena made Shirone's group quite uncomfortable.

While they were teacher and students at school, outside it was only proper for men to escort women. But the waiter paid no attention to the students, focusing his gaze solely on Siena.

"Welcome, madam. Thank you for visiting Gold Cupid. Especially having such a beautiful lady personally visit our establishment—I don't know what to do with myself."

Flirting was one thing, but he was obviously ignoring Shirone's group intentionally.

'Tch. They call this a top-class restaurant, but what kind of staff training do they give? How presumptuous can you get? As if our teacher would show any interest in a playboy like you.'

Nade was seething inside. His gaze meticulously scanned the prices on the menu. He would order the most expensive dish. He intended to give that waiter who treated them like children a lesson.

Iruki casually ordered course after course without thinking. Encouraged by this, Nade ordered another course meal.

Shirone was still deliberating. In truth, every menu item was unfamiliar to him. How was he supposed to know whether "Braised Ollaris" was meat, fish, or monster tongue?

But he had a keen sense for reading situations, so he calmly ordered the same thing as Nade. Iruki's menu choices seemed risky.

As VIP-level dishes kept being ordered, the waiter's face grew increasingly pale. His first thought was whether these people could afford to pay. While all dishes had premium pricing, there was more than a threefold difference between the cheapest and most expensive items. If these unworldly children had made a mistake, they might face a bill twelve times their expectation.

The waiter glanced anxiously at Siena. But she seemed unconcerned as she selected her own menu.

"I'll have the Dasco course, please. And a bottle of Limunes."

Siena wasn't much of a drinker, but she occasionally had cognac when feeling melancholy. Limunes was a distilled liquor with a subtle vanilla aroma—expensive but popular with women for its pleasant aftertaste.

"Huh? Teacher, you're going to drink alcohol?"

"What's wrong with that? You guys break locks and barge into people's houses, but I can't drink?"

Nade laughed awkwardly.

"Haha. That's true. Oh, right! Teacher, today's your day off, isn't it?"

Seeing the waiter click his tongue and walk away, Shirone's group exchanged glances and snickered. But as their reason gradually returned, anxiety crept into their eyes. Realizing that all four of them had ordered course meals, the price list automatically floated up in their minds. Only then did they worry whether their bravado had been misplaced, but Siena looked unconcerned.

A certified 6th-grade magician's income placed them in the top 10 percent of noble society. Moreover, working at Alpheas Magic School, one of the Kingdom's five prestigious institutions, she could fully enjoy her life even without touching the Olifer School's resources.

'Come to think of it, our teacher really has made it in life.'

A life pursuing dreams rather than money. But Shirone, as the son of a woodcutter, knew better than anyone that this wasn't as easy as it sounded.

With four different course meals, food kept arriving at their table without interruption. People sitting at other tables glanced over with expressions of disgust.

Shirone and his friends paid no attention and were frantically trying to steal each other's food. Nade and Iruki were nobles and Shirone had learned dining etiquette, but among friends, refinement was utterly useless.

Forks and knives flew across the table, but Siena just watched her students eat with relish and smiled.

When their stomachs were full and the flavors became less appealing, they discussed magic like proper magic school students. It was an enjoyable and beneficial time for Siena too. Laughter never left the table and her gloomy mood lifted, so Nade's strategy had worked perfectly.

"Hehehe. Teacher, this unworthy student would like to offer a toast to his respected mentor."

"Hmph! You think I'll go easy on you for that? I'm only keeping quiet because we're eating. Be prepared when we get back."

"Yes, yes, how could I object? Here, please accept this."

Nade's excellent social skills shone even in situations like this. Siena didn't seem particularly displeased either, accepting whatever he offered. Since cognac was quite strong, Shirone asked worriedly.

"Teacher, aren't you drinking too much?"

"Huhu, it's fine. This much is nothing."

"Of course. You're a certified 6th-grade magician—you wouldn't be defeated by mere alcohol."

No matter what Siena said, Nade responded positively. He would probably believe her if she called a fork a trident.

"Oh? You're being quite desperate. But really, it's fine. I'm pretty good with alcohol."

Under Shirone's concerned gaze, Siena knocked back another shot of the strong liquor straight.

One hour later.

"Hey, you! You there, you! Nade."

"Yes, teacher."

With her elbows on the cleared table, Siena swayed with a flushed face. Meanwhile, Shirone's group sat ramrod straight, breaking out in cold sweat.

In one hour, an entire bottle of cognac had been emptied.

Siena's tongue was twisted and her eyes had lost focus slightly. Unable to even turn their heads, Shirone's group could only move their eyes to exchange glances.

'We're in trouble. Teacher's drunk.'

Siena had been mumbling something in a small voice when she suddenly drooped her head low. Afraid she might fall from her chair, Nade hurriedly grabbed her arm.

"Teacher, are you alright? We should head back now."

"You troublemaker!"

Siena suddenly jerked her head up and mercilessly grabbed Nade's cheek, stretching it like taffy as he was dragged along with a pained expression.

"Owww! It hurts!"

"Listen to what I'm saying. I want to be a kind teacher like Teacher Ethella too. Don't get distracted by strange things and study hard."

"Yes, yes! I understand, teacher! It really hurts!"

"And Shirone, Iruki. You two!"

"Yes!"

Shirone and Iruki straightened their already rigid postures even more, assuming perfectly disciplined positions.

"Same goes for you two. If you think you can slack off just because you're talented, I won't forgive you. It doesn't matter if you think I'm a bad teacher. I won't forgive you."

"No one thinks you're bad. So please try to pull yourself together."

"Phew. Yes, I know. I know why I put myself through this hardship voluntarily. Mmm."

Siena's eyelids drooped halfway and her head fell. Eventually, she buried her face in the table, using her arms as a pillow.

"Teacher, you need to snap out of it, right? Teacher? We haven't even paid the bill yet."

"Sleepy. Going to sleep."

"Teacher?"

Siena didn't respond.

Nade looked at his friends with a dumbfounded expression. But they had no solutions either. As they were racking their brains on how to overcome this crisis, two men who had been watching from a nearby table approached.

"The young lady seems quite intoxicated. Shall we call a carriage?"

A well-dressed young man spoke to Siena. Behind him stood a handsome man with a sly smile.

Shirone's group's eyes simultaneously turned cold. They had already noticed when they entered. These men had been watching Siena from the start, making lewd comments about her.

"Teacher? Teacher. Please try to come to your senses."

The best strategy was to wake Siena as quickly as possible and leave. But just as she seemed to lift her upper body, she ultimately couldn't hold on and collapsed back onto the table. Catching the word "teacher" in Nade's words, the man's eyes lit up as he moved closer.
