"Ah! An educator, I see. Pleased to meet you. I am Cosine Silver, fourth-rank nobility. My father serves as a clerk in Creas. Forgive my boldness, but I was smitten at first sight. If you would grant me the honor of escorting you home, I would consider it infinite glory."

Siena slowly sat up, wiggling her upper body. But instead of looking at Silver, she supported her forehead with both hands and sighed.

'Ugh, how annoying. I just wanted to get drunk today.'

It seemed like only bad things were happening today. She had shown weakness to her students, been ignored by Kaira, and now strange men were clinging to her.

A bitter smile crossed Siena's lips at the thought. Perhaps right now she looked exactly like a woman who had just been dumped.

'Hehe. Still, there are people who say they like me. A woman like me with a violent personality and no compassion.'

She had never felt romantic love for anyone. Even when Armin appeared with Kaira three years ago, she hadn't felt betrayed. But there had been a glimmer of expectation. The feeling of wondering what it would be like if they met again. But could that really be called love?

"I introduced myself too grandly. I'm sorry about that. I suppose my desire to make a good impression was too strong when meeting a woman I absolutely didn't want to let slip away. Please forgive me if I was rude."

"It's fine. I'm tired, so please go away."

Siena was truly exhausted. Of course, with the mental fortitude of a certified 6th-grade magician, sobering up wouldn't be difficult, but she still needed the unrealistic haziness that alcohol provided.

"It wouldn't be chivalrous to leave a lady alone. I'll take you home in my carriage. Please lean on me."

When Silver grabbed Siena's shoulder and tried to support her, Shirone's group immediately objected.

"What are you doing? Don't touch our teacher carelessly."

"There seems to be some misunderstanding. I'm trying to escort her. This isn't something for kids to interfere with, so you should go home. The teacher can ride in the carriage."

Silver tried to forcibly support Siena. Then Shirone grabbed his wrist. Silver's face, which had been gentle like a lamb in front of Siena, instantly contorted. He could tolerate being ignored by a woman for his intended purpose. But being treated like this by a kid was something his pride wouldn't allow.

"Hey, you insolent brat. Where did you learn such manners? Let go of my hand while I'm being nice."

"The teacher said she doesn't want to. Please leave. We'll escort the teacher."

"These little punks are so full of themselves. I saw earlier that you were the ones who got her drunk—what are you scheming? What school do you attend? Do you all want to be expelled?"

Shirone's expression turned cold. The reason he deliberately brought up school was to pressure Siena. If a teacher caused trouble in a place like this, it would become the subject of gossip.

Iruki spoke up.

"So you're saying you've been watching us this whole time. Then all the more reason this isn't something you should interfere with. And let me tell you one more thing—the teacher here isn't someone for a person like you to pester."

"You? Did you just say 'you' to me?"

"Then what should I call you if not 'you'? Should I call you a pervert?"

"You disrespectful little bastard!"

Silver converted his slight intoxication into anger and grabbed Iruki by the collar. But immediately his side tingled and the strength left his hand. Silver grimaced and stepped back, clutching his stomach.

"Ugh! What was that?"

Nade was generating electricity in his palm.

"Get lost. Next time I'll fry your lower parts."

A handsome man who had been waiting to use force if necessary approached Silver from behind with a serious expression.

"Hey, those kids are magic school students."

"Magic school? Alpheas Magic School?"

Silver's expression also turned grim. Magic schools had a different status from regular schools attended by ordinary nobles. Moreover, if it was Alpheas Magic School, it was one of the kingdom's top five prestigious schools where only the highest nobility gathered.

As Silver rolled his eyes, focusing on assessing the situation, Iruki snorted and approached him.

"I heard you were going to expel us?"

"No, that's..."

"I am Iruki Mercodaine. Go ahead and try to expel me if you can."

"Me, Mercodaine?"

It felt like all the alcohol he'd drunk was sobering up at once. No matter how much of a provincial city Creas was, there wasn't a single person among the nobility of the Tormia Kingdom who didn't know the Mercodaine name.

Not only were they first-rank nobility, but they were also the supreme scholarly family that had never lost their position as head of 'Yongroe,' the king's advisory body, for hundreds of years.

As Silver's pupils shook frantically, Iruki made an unpleasant expression as if he had expected this. Wherever he went, there were always so-called 'family name-dropping' nobles. Still, the reason he intimidated Silver in this detestable way was to protect Siena. He knew this guy didn't have the guts to pull anything, but just in case he might use her weakness as a teacher to cause harm, he had nipped it in the bud. Of course, he didn't think someone from the Olifer School like her would be shaken by something like this.

"Let's go, Silver. Hey, Silver!"

The handsome man grabbed Silver's arm and pulled him away. Silver was also grateful to his friend for saving face and ran away with his tail between his legs. Even after they disappeared, Shirone's group couldn't contain their anger. From how he had openly pestered Siena, it was clear they hadn't been in his consideration at all. Being small in stature probably made them look even more ridiculous.

"This place has a really bad atmosphere. You really can't judge by appearances alone. Let's never come here again."

"Yeah. Anyway, let's get out of here. It's getting dark."

"Teacher, are you alright?"

"Mm. I'm fine. Let's go."

Siena, supported by Nade, stood up with difficulty. She was annoyed by the sudden flies that had swarmed around, but it wasn't an unpleasant feeling. With her students protecting her so reliably, what was there to fear? Even as a certified 6th-grade magician, outside she was just one woman accustomed to receiving escort according to noble etiquette.

Suddenly her students looked adorable. Siena gladly paid for dinner and walked out the door with unsteady steps.

The moon was up in the sky.

As moonlight poured down from the cloudless sky, Siena let out a blissful moan filled with ecstasy.

She felt strangely good. It was probably because of the alcohol, but perhaps she had made a new leap forward today. She felt that for the first time, she could escape from Armin's shadow and live her own life. Probably because of the alcohol, though...

"Ahh, I feel good. I feel so good today."

Siena looked up at the moon like a young girl and spun around and around. Shirone's group, who had just emerged from the restaurant, stood with their mouths agape.

Had the alcohol temporarily melted her frozen heart?

With her violet hair flowing loose, she was beautiful under the moonlight. The sight of her trench coat spreading like an umbrella as she spun was also amusing. People wandering the night streets turned their gaze to her, but no one clicked their tongue or frowned.

Siena's appearance was that lovely.

Shirone's group didn't feel like stopping her either. Instead, they watched with fascination as she displayed a drunken side they had never seen before.

"So the teacher had this kind of personality. This is unexpected, isn't it?"

"Could it be... did we just catch a scoop?"

Iruki's eyes gleamed as he fell into thought.

"Hmm. This could be used as a weapon, right? A weapon to prevent the research society from being disbanded."

"If we handle it properly, it seems possible. Siena isn't the type to perjure herself. She'd probably be embarrassed if she remembered this herself, wouldn't she?"

While Nade and Iruki were plotting, Shirone pointed at Siena and shouted.

"Hey! Look, over there!"

Siena's steps were getting tangled as she kept circling the same spot. Like a spinning top losing momentum, she looked ready to fall at any moment.

"Catch her!"

It would be a disaster if she fell in front of all these people. Shirone supported her back while Nade and Iruki grabbed her arms on both sides.

"Teacher, please pull yourself together. We need you to be okay so we can get into school."

"Mmm. I'm dizzy."

Siena staggered in a zigzag pattern. Having emptied a bottle of cognac in an hour and spun dozens of times, how could she be in her right mind? It was like drinking punishment liquor instead of alcohol.

"Hey, hey! This won't work. Shirone, try carrying her on your back."

"What? Why me?"

"Still, you're the strongest among us."

Shirone sighed. Even though three 18-year-old boys were gathered here, they were all weaker than their peers because they had devoted themselves to magic training without proper sleep or meals.

At least Shirone had some physical strength compared to his friends, perhaps because he had climbed mountains and chopped wood since childhood.

"Can't be helped. Then teacher, please get on my back."

"Don't make it so obvious you don't want to. Do you think you'll often get a chance to carry the teacher on your back? I'm actually dying of envy."

Nade's expression didn't look envious at all. Rather, he was grinning mischievously with relief in his eyes.

"Tch. If only you couldn't talk."

Shirone, with Siena on his back, began walking. Once they left the noble district, the number of people noticeably decreased. For commoners who earned their daily bread each day, leisure activities were nothing but luxury.

"But Siena is surprisingly small. Now that I'm actually carrying her, she's quite petite. I usually thought she was about my height."

"It's probably psychological. Teachers usually seem bigger, don't they?"

"Is that so? But she's also surprisingly heavy. It's getting harder and harder."

Iruki nodded and laughed.

"Kekeke. Well, she's human, so wouldn't she be heavy? Women are also made of bones, muscles, and flesh. You didn't think she'd be light as a feather, did you?"

He hadn't thought that exactly, but he had vaguely expected her to be lighter. But he couldn't let them know that he had never even held a woman's hand, let alone carried one on his back.

"No! I knew that much. But this is really hard. I don't think I can make it to school."

"If you can't make it, we can't either. Just bear with it and walk."

"Couldn't we use magic? We could float her with air magic."

"Even so, she's our teacher, so that would be a bit..."

When he actually thought about it, it would look strange. In the end, Shirone, who was stuck being a palanquin, grumbled about how unfair it was.

"There are three guys here and we can't carry one woman? At times like this, I envy Rian. If it were Rian, he could probably carry me while I'm carrying Siena. I should have learned Schema instead."

Nade and Iruki remained silent. Honestly, it was a situation that made them feel self-loathing since they couldn't even carry one delicate woman.

But really, women were heavier creatures than expected, and having only known books, they had no physical strength whatsoever.

"What can we do? The only exercise we've done is breathing. I'm confident in brain work though."

Iruki snapped his fingers.

"Then why don't you use your brain? Learn Schema right now. Shirone, how about it? Think you can do it?"

"Does that make sense? How can I suddenly do Schema?"

"You can try. In my case, I even did Spirit Zone in one go. Don't tell me you guys couldn't do it?"

Nade said, "No, I succeeded in one try too. When I started after getting the general feel, it worked right away. Shirone, how about you?"

Shirone, who had been struggling under Siena's weight, looked up.

"Huh? Oh, I did it in one try too. Actually, at the time I didn't even know it was Spirit Zone."

Could someone enter Spirit Zone without even knowing it was Spirit Zone? Iruki giggled, thinking that was just like Shirone.

"That's peculiar. Anyway, that's why I'm telling you to try it right now. The basic principle is the same, isn't it?"

Listening to it, Iruki's words made sense. Of course, aptitude existed, but there was no harm in trying.

"Should I? Should I really try it once? Actually, my arms are so sore I'm dying."
