Nade encouraged him.

"Come on, try it. First, project your body image in a state of selflessness. Then..."

"I know what it is too. Just wait a moment. Let me concentrate."

As his friends fell silent, Shirone closed his eyes. The state of selflessness just before entering the Spirit Zone. From there, he had to project his body image and awaken his entire body's sensations through insight!

"Ugh... Aaaah! No, it's not working. It's getting even harder."

Iruki said, holding back laughter.

"You fool, did you really think it would work? Being specialized in Spirit Zone means you have absolutely no talent for Schema."

"Puhahaha!"

When Nade couldn't hold back and burst into laughter, Shirone glared at the two of them with fierce eyes.

"Damn it, I'm not doing this! Switch!"

In the end, the three of them decided to take turns carrying Siena.

However, Nade collapsed after walking only half the distance Shirone had covered, and Iruki couldn't even manage ten steps.

Shirone, who picked up Siena again with trembling arms, was incredulous.

"Hey, don't we look incredibly pathetic?"

"It's against etiquette to voice thoughts that should remain as thoughts, Shirone."

With Nade's final words, the three of them fell silent. It wasn't that they were overcome with self-loathing. They were just too exhausted to bother talking.

When they arrived at the school, Shirone suddenly spoke up.

"You know... let's stop that."

"Stop what? What are you talking about?"

"Using what happened today to negotiate with Teacher Siena."

"Hmm."

Nade also felt a pang of conscience, in truth. But it was a matter of the research society's very survival.

"But there's no other good method. Did you think of a way to save the research society?"

"No. But I think that should be separate from this. Honestly, today... I think it was an incredibly sad day for Teacher Siena. I don't know the details, but that's how I feel."

It was something they all sensed. She had said goodbye to someone she'd kept in her heart since childhood. The fact that it ended with just a drink showed that Siena was a strong person.

"But isn't it strange to get too sentimental? What's our reason for living? Apart from using our brains, we're corpses. At times like this, we need to be cold and rational. It's not like we have an immediate way to save the research society, so is there really a need to force it?"

Iruki's words also had persuasive power. If you make wrong judgments by being swayed by emotions, the future ahead would be nothing but hardship.

Nade's heart also began to lean in that direction.

"Hmm. Honestly, Teacher Siena is a difficult type to deal with. She has no weaknesses. How desperate must we have been to even think of this? It really is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."

Iruki chimed in agreement.

"She's prickly in personality, thorough in planning, meticulous in student management. Especially what we heard before - she didn't hesitate to talk about dating Shirone to prevent Overflow and such. What can we do against such a thoroughly blocked opponent?"

'These guys...!'

Siena, who had been listening with her eyes closed, felt a surge of anger. She was feeling down and her body was drowsy, so she had planned to quietly let herself be carried, but she couldn't stand listening to this anymore.

"But now we know."

Shirone said.

"Why the teacher chose the path of teaching, why she was so obsessed with Overflow. Teacher Siena doesn't want us to walk the same path as her."

"Well, that's true, but..."

"Regardless of what circumstances led the teacher to become an educator, what's important is that she truly cares for us. But what about us? We're trying to attack her by using even her painful past as a weakness. The senior members of the research society wouldn't want to see their juniors become this corrupt either."

This time, even Iruki couldn't argue back. Magicians always pursue efficiency, but when you become too focused on efficiency, you end up missing what's truly important.

"...You always hit the nail on the head at times like this."

Nade, having made his decision, said with relief.

"Alright. Let's bury today's incident about the teacher as our secret. How about it, Iruki?"

"If we can't link it to the research society matter, I have no complaints. Honestly, I think Teacher Siena is the best when it comes to education."

"True, we're the villains. Teachers like Teacher Siena who look after students so meticulously are rare. Besides, compared to what we did, she's really been quite lenient with us."

Iruki said.

"Let's give in just this once. As for the research society matter, if the three of us put our heads together, won't we come up with some solution?"

Shirone said.

"Then that's what we'll do? Even if we get disciplined tomorrow, what happened today goes to the grave with us. We absolutely won't breathe a word of it!"

"Good! Deal!"

Being freed from false hope actually made them feel better. Shirone's group moved their feet diligently with lighter hearts than before. No one knew that Siena, who was being carried on Shirone's back, had been awake with her eyes open for some time now.

The main gate of the magic school came into view. Shirone, half-exhausted, spotted a guard standing with a torch and stopped walking. Since midnight hadn't passed yet, the night shift hadn't gone off duty.

"What do we do? If we go back looking like this, who knows what rumors might spread. Besides, we left without permission."

"Can't be helped. Let's use magic from here. I'll levitate Teacher Siena, so you support her."

"Wait. First, let me put the teacher down. Iruki, help me."

As he bent his knees, the weight on his back suddenly disappeared. When the surprised Shirone turned around, Siena was standing upright with perfect posture. Her drunken appearance had vanished, and her eyes were as clear as starlight.

"T-Teacher?"

The dejected Shirone collapsed right where he stood. If she could walk, what did that make him, who had struggled to carry her all this way?

"Teacher, are you really alright?"

"Of course. Did you really think I'd get drunk?"

Shirone exhaled roughly and sniffled.

"But why all this time..."

"If you eat an expensive meal, you have to earn your keep. Were you trying to avoid even this much hardship? Anyway, follow me. If you want to get in quietly."

Shirone's group followed Siena as if possessed by ghosts. The guard who recognized her raised his sleepy eyes and greeted her.

"Ah, good evening, Teacher Siena."

"Yes. Thank you for your hard work."

"But... were you out with the students?"

"Yes. I took them out for field study."

"Ah, I see. Welcome back. Have a peaceful night."

According to school rules, student entry at night was prohibited, but if it was the word of Siena, who had high standing within the school, there was no reason to doubt it.

Shirone's group, who had been worried for nothing, quickly passed through the school gate. Their hearts raced, afraid the guard might call out from behind. When they safely reached the central park, Siena turned around and glared at them.

"Hiiek!"

Shirone's group could finally feel it in their bones. They had returned to Alpheas Magic School.

"I'll let what happened today slide."

When completely unexpected words came out, Shirone's group looked at Siena with surprised, blinking eyes.

"Starting today, I'll give you another month. That's the maximum negotiation card I can offer."

Shirone's group understood what she meant. Resetting the grace period meant she was telling them to have a real showdown.

"Find a way to convince the school within a month. Whether you hold a presentation or bring a ghost, that's up to your discretion. If you truly take pride in the research society, fight the school fair and square and seize what you want. That's my educational philosophy and the way I love my students."

Shirone's group felt a surge of emotion. They couldn't believe that Siena, of all people, had said this to them.

"Yes! Please look forward to it! We'll definitely surprise the school!"

"Right! Struggling pathetically isn't our style! This time, let's really think it through and take on the challenge!"

Siena watched her disciples who had regained their confidence with a bitter smile. While it was true that when their enthusiasm soared sky-high, anxiety came first, on the other hand, she was curious about what amazing thing they might accomplish.

'Hehe. Work hard, you persistent students.'

## The Invisible Thing(1)

Shirone, who visited the research society later than usual, saw Nade and Iruki lying on the sofa and weakly raised his hand.

"Hi."

"Did you sleep well last night?"

"I don't know. I don't even know if I slept. What about you guys?"

"Same here. What do we do now? We had meetings all night yesterday too, but not a single good idea came up."

Shirone sat on the sofa and said.

"We absolutely have to decide today. Let's come up with countermeasures."

"So how? Supernatural paranormal science is about invisible phenomena. But humans don't believe in things they can't see."

The same conversation from last night was repeating. Too tired to even speak, they stared blankly at one spot. Their heads felt empty, like blank paper. How much time had passed? Focus returned to Shirone's eyes.

"How about we change our thinking?"

Nade and Iruki sat up abruptly. They didn't know what he would say, but it was definitely different from the patterns that had appeared so far.

"How?"

"I mean, our dilemma is this, right? That there's no way to show the invisible."

"Right. That's the big problem."

"So what I'm saying is, if it's invisible, then we don't necessarily need to show it. Haven't we been clinging to something impossible all this time? Rather, wouldn't it be fine to build our method around not showing it?"

Saying they didn't need to show it was tantamount to saying they didn't need to hold a presentation. But his friends weren't disappointed. Rather, as if they had realized something, they fell into thought.

"What can't be verified doesn't need to be verified."

"Exactly that. The reason I joined the research society wasn't because you guys showed me something. So wouldn't it be the same for other people?"

A smile slowly formed on Iruki's lips.

"Why didn't we think of that? Right, we didn't need to verify from the beginning. We didn't need to show what even we don't know. Rather, the opposite..."

"Make them believe in the invisible?"

Nade was convinced this was the answer he had been looking for. He immediately left his seat, embraced Shirone, and rolled around.

"Shirone! Come here! You saved our research society! You can have my first kiss!"

"Gross! Get away!"

While Shirone and Nade wrestled on the sofa, Iruki was lost in thought. The really difficult part was just beginning.

"Then what would be good? Shirone's words are the solution, but we still need to maintain the character of a presentation. In the end, we need some visible results."

Nade returned to his seat. Shirone also smoothed down his disheveled hair. This wasn't the time to fool around.

"Let's think about it once. What to show."

The three of them put their heads together and deliberated. Once they got a handle on it, countless methods came to mind. The key point was something that would make people believe in the invisible.

"Wouldn't something auditory be good? It's easy to design too."

"It would be efficient. But it wouldn't be effective. We also have to think about whether the school would accept it."

"Then let's go with something visual. And auditory if possible. Pour everything we can into it."

"Then what do we visualize? Supernatural? Paranormal?"

"Supernatural isn't popular with the masses. I think paranormal would be better."

Nade raised his hand.

"I vote for paranormal too. There are things like souls, ghosts, paranormal phenomena - which of these?"

Shirone said.

"Wouldn't ghosts be better? Because they're impactful."

"But wouldn't that be childish?"

Nade made a skeptical expression. But Iruki thought Shirone was right.

"I think ghosts are better too. The key is that we need to penetrate people's thoughts strongly."

"Mmm. No matter how I think about it, it seems childish."

Shirone said.

"What we need to consider first is effectiveness. Other things are secondary issues. I don't think we need to give up on it."
