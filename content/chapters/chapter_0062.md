"Do you have something in mind?"

"Let's set up a psychological trap. Something like this."

Shirone gathered his friends and explained the operation. After hearing the plan, Nade and Iruki remained silent. Shirone, feeling slightly less confident, added more explanation.

"Even if it's not necessarily this method, wouldn't doing something like this increase our chances of success? For example, using keywords..."

Iruki shook his head.

"No, Shirone, I think it's good. Not just good—it will definitely succeed. This is quite profound. With this method, we can use the presentation as a setup."

Once the overall picture became clear, Shirone's group began planning the detailed operation.

"The remaining problem is this: How do we create the ghost?"

The technical aspects were Nade's specialty. He stood up from the sofa and cast Lightning Shadow, creating another Nade made of electrical afterimages.

"By casting Lightning Shadow like this, we can create a realistic ghost form. But this alone won't fool anyone. It can't move, after all."

"Then let's think from there. What would we need to do to make the ghost form move?"

"Here's what comes to mind immediately. For example, to make Lightning Shadow move, I'd need to cast magic at tremendous speed."

Nade cast Lightning Shadow repeatedly while walking. Though discontinuous, the afterimage appeared to be walking.

"I see. You can use optical illusions to make it look real?"

"Right. But magic alone has its limits. Moreover, at my level, I can't even increase the number of entities."

Shirone asked.

"What if we used mechanical devices?"

"It's not as simple as it sounds. Even if we built devices, there'd be mountains of things to consider. The biggest problem is that just movement alone won't fool people. To really look like a ghost, it needs to have reactivity to external stimuli."

For Nade, who had built hologram devices before, implementing ghost phantoms wasn't the issue. But if they couldn't react to people's actions, the fake would be immediately discovered.

Iruki, who had been contemplating something, spoke up.

"What if we... predicted people's reactions in advance?"

"Predict reactions?"

"Introduce chaos theory. Analyze all the behavioral patterns of the masses and program them. A method that creates the illusion of receiving feedback. But it would require an enormous amount of information. We'd need a medium to transmit the information and a control device."

"Hmm. Information transmission. Certainly, my electrical power has limits. Then... Ah!"

Nade looked at Shirone.

"Photon output! Shirone's photon output!"

"Aha. With photon output..."

Shirone also thought it was possible. Though he had learned the magic for the targeting exam, he'd heard that research on transmitting information through photon output was underway at the cutting edge of magical society.

"Now it's coming together. Nade will build the hologram devices. I'll write the programs for the devices. Shirone's photon output will transmit my programs to the devices. It'll probably require massive output—can you handle it?"

"I have to pull it off. We can't let this opportunity slip away."

It was a ray of light in the darkness. Just having hope for something they thought impossible moved Nade to tears.

"We can do it. We can save the research society. Assuming nothing unexpected happens, of course."

"If we succeed, the school will be turned upside down, won't it?"

"It'll be more than that. There'll be chaos. I'm betting everything on this. Besides, it sounds incredibly fun. Heh heh heh. I'm already looking forward to the teachers' reactions."

Shirone's group looked at each other with meaningful smiles. Staking the fate of the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society, an unprecedented event in the magic school's history was about to unfold.

* * *

Shirone devoted time to increasing the power of his photon output. The key was to increase the output strength while extending the duration. Since massless photons couldn't exert physical force and couldn't be used for attack magic, this characteristic actually became an advantage. He could enter any warehouse in Estas and train.

Shirone raised his concentration with a magical action of extending both hands and cast photon output. A beam of light spread in a circle on the wall. First was duration. If he couldn't maintain this state for 10 minutes, increasing the output would be nothing but a pipe dream.

Shooting photon output for 10 minutes exceeded Class Five level, but Nade's hologram devices and Iruki's chaos theory equations were equally challenging endeavors.

'I have to do it. I have to...'

Shirone gritted his teeth and endured. After 3 minutes, his consciousness became hazy. During the Speed Gun exam, he had barely lasted 1 minute with intermittent photon output. Compared to that, this was remarkable growth, but still far short of his target.

"Huff! Gasp!"

The time he endured by squeezing out every ounce of strength was 3 minutes and 20 seconds. Within the next 15 days, he needed to extend this time to 10 minutes. After recording his time, he always rested for exactly 20 minutes. It was training dangerous enough to risk his life if he neglected rest.

Sitting collapsed, Shirone paid attention to the noise coming from the next room. It seemed Nade had begun welding work. Taking advantage of his break, he decided to check on that situation. Opening the door to the next room, he found Nade buried among all sorts of parts.

"Hey, you're here? How's the output duration?"

"So-so. Extended it by 20 seconds. How about you?"

"As you can see, still working on the engine."

"Can you finish in time?"

"I have to. Don't worry. Prototypes always take time. Once you enter the production process, it's hard to fix errors even if you find them. That's why I'm taking the time to be thorough."

"I see. By the way, what about what Iruki mentioned?"

"Oh, that? I received it yesterday. This."

Nade tossed a finger-thick cord at Shirone's feet. The outer covering was rubber, and inside, a transparent membrane like quartz ran through it. It was something Iruki had specially requested from his father, who was head of the Lightning Guild.

Since 300 hologram devices were scheduled to be installed throughout various parts of the school, it would be impossible for Shirone alone to cast photon output on every device.

Initially, Nade had thought of mirrors. The idea was that when Shirone cast photon output, they would use the total reflection properties of light to transmit it to the mechanical devices. But there were too many sections where the light would need to bend for practical implementation.

Nade thought about what would happen with many more mirrors. He reached the conclusion that by creating a tunnel of light through a small hose with mirrors attached, they could create the effect of light bending like differentiating a straight line.

Nade proudly announced this discovery. He also added that if they could build it, he'd be sitting on a gold mine from that day forward.

But Iruki burst his bubble. The monthly letters from his father contained various issues from magical society, and a few months ago, a letter had already introduced exactly what Nade had described. It was called "optical fiber."

Nade's disappointment was indescribable. Even Iruki felt sorry for him since this was a field just beginning development even in the ivory towers at magic's cutting edge.

But after actually receiving and analyzing the item, Nade shook his head. The delicate engineering technology packed into it was so sophisticated that he could never create it at his current level.

'Still, you had the same idea as the ivory tower. Nade really is amazing.'

Shirone picked up the optical fiber and examined it closely. To the naked eye, he couldn't tell what was so impressive about it.

"Still, you managed to get it somehow."

Nade, who had finished welding, stood up rubbing his reddened eyes.

"It's also in the very early stages at the ivory tower, so we can't expect much performance. Let's try a demonstration first. I made a tester."

Nade handed Shirone the modified optical fiber. Unlike what he'd shown before, this had a transparent orb attached to the end.

"What do I do with this?"

"Just hold it and cast photon output. I'll calculate the efficiency, so do it now. But you need to pour everything out. Measuring the maximum is important."

Shirone gripped the crystal orb and cast photon output. Since his rest time was over anyway, there was nothing to hold back. A light source formed in his hand, and the crystal orb glowed palely. The needle on Nade's device connected to the optical fiber began fluctuating. Nade watched the instrument panel until Shirone reached his 3-minute limit, then spoke in a dejected voice.

"Sigh, Iruki was right. This is completely an early development product. Well, I suppose I should be grateful for even this much?"

"Is it that bad?"

"The efficiency is only 18 percent. That means only 18 percent of the light you're shooting reaches its destination."

"Eighteen percent..."

The moment he heard it, Shirone felt deflated too. In a situation where maintaining photon output for 10 minutes was already distant, an 18 percent transmission efficiency meant he'd need to increase his output five times just to reach 100 percent.

"Shirone, can you do it? If you can't increase your output, we'll never succeed. High-output magical energy is impossible to implement mechanically."

Shirone nodded as if making a last stand.

"I'll try. If I practice, I'll manage somehow."

"You can really do it?"

"Yeah. Don't worry. I'll figure it out somehow. I'm going back to practice now."

"Really? You'll really do it?"

Shirone turned his head as he left and shouted.

"I said I would!"

* * *

Shirone lay sprawled in the warehouse, gasping for breath. The aftermath of casting photon output for half a day was affecting not just his mind but his body as well.

"Huff! Huff!"

His final photon output record was 3 minutes and 20 seconds. No different from the morning record. But since he'd achieved this while mentally exhausted, it was as good as progress. Considering his record had dropped to 2 minutes and 34 seconds an hour ago, his desperate final effort had been effective.

'Even so, it's nowhere near enough. How am I supposed to achieve 10 minutes like this?'

Perhaps it had been impossible from the start. Photon output, being a projection-type magic, consumed mental energy far faster than single-shot active magic. Maintaining such magic for 10 minutes was only possible in the professional world.

"Sigh, I don't know. I'll have to try again tomorrow in good condition."

Nade opened the warehouse door and entered.

"Shirone, finished?"

"Yeah. I can't do any more today even if it kills me. I need to rest first."

"I'm exhausted from just watching sparks all day. It's past midnight. Let's tell Iruki to head back."

Had it already gotten that late? Calculating, he'd been doing nothing but photon output for over 7 hours. It was a life-threatening amount of training. If the school found out, they'd certainly impose a magic practice ban.

Shirone struggled to get up. Nade's appearance was also terrible. His eyes were sunken, and his face was blotchy from long exposure to electric light.

Returning to the research society, they found Iruki with a bird's-eye view map of the school spread out, rapidly moving his pen. He was solving behavioral patterns with equations, considering variables that would occur on the day of the operation.

Nade looked at him with concern. Like Shirone and himself, Iruki seemed not to have moved once since sitting down.

"How's it going, Iruki? Are the calculations working out?"

Without taking his eyes off his notebook, Iruki said.

"So-so. I can finish in time, so don't worry."

Nade's heart ached, feeling like his excessive ambition was harming his friends' health.

"Was it too unreasonable a request? Honestly, calculating the behavioral patterns of the entire student body..."

"I can do it. I said I can do it. Don't make me talk. I'm busy right now."

With those words, Iruki closed his mouth. Equations were being written on his notebook at a frightening pace.
