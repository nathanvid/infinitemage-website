Obsession bordering on madness, and ecstasy.

Shirone felt a chill. Everyone had been forgetting sleep and immersing themselves in work for days now. When he calculated it, their average sleep time per day seemed to be only about 1 hour and 40 minutes.

Even when Shirone had been studying intensively, his workload hadn't been this extreme. But strangely, he didn't feel more tired than before. It was as if the pain had become numb.

'They usually slack off so much, but when it's time to actually do something, they work frighteningly hard.'

Seeing them literally devote themselves to their respective fields as if even sleeping time was too precious to waste, Shirone felt an unprecedented desire for achievement.

"Nade, are you tired right now?"

"No, not at all. Actually, am I tired? I honestly don't know. I feel like my mind is opened up."

"Me too. Since Iruki is working, let's start with the script. We also need to make phrases for the posters. Even these small details take time when you actually try to do them."

"Oh, should we? Then let's put up the posters tomorrow first."

"Will that be okay? We're not even at the stage where we can predict the workload yet."

"We'll have to take the risk. It's best to announce as quickly as possible. I don't want to seem desperate. Since it's psychological warfare, we need to consider these aspects too, don't we?"

"You're right. Then I'll make the poster phrases, and you think about the design."

The two spread papers on the table and began making posters. Though it was late at night, their minds remained bright.

The next day.

Near the end of lunch time, a poster appeared on the bulletin board. It was an announcement for the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society's presentation. Most students reacted with bewilderment. True to its nature as an underground research society, it hadn't engaged in official activities, so even its name was unfamiliar. The poster in particular was so tasteless it was laughable. It distorted the proper scenery of the magic school to create an eerie landscape, looking like a circus performance poster.

Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society Emergency Presentation!

Shocking Revelation! Those who want to know the identity of souls, gather at Lecture Hall 7.

"Paranormal science? What's that? Are they talking about ghosts?"

"So there was a research society like this too. They must really have nothing better to do. Who exactly are the kids who joined such a ridiculous research society?"

"Huh? Guys, look at this."

A female student pointed to the bottom of the poster. Students who discovered the research society members' names widened their eyes.

"Isn't that Shirone-senpai? What's going on? Is there someone with the same name?"

"How could there be? It's really Shirone-senpai. Look, here next to him are Mercenary Iruki and Nade-senpai too."

"But there are only three of them total? Did they make this for performance assessment? Even so, this is too much. Why would they join such a research society?"

"When is the presentation? Should we attend too?"

"I'd like to go see it. Since Shirone-senpai is there, it's somehow interesting, right? Maybe they really discovered the identity of ghosts?"

"We'll know when we see it. Hehehe! Anyway, it should be fun."

The students turned away casually. The atmosphere was like going to watch a theatrical performance rather than an academic conference. On the other hand, those who operated in the shadows like the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society couldn't hide their puzzlement. They gathered avoiding others' attention and whispered.

"What's going on? A presentation from the 'Supernatural Society'?"

"According to intelligence, they seem to be at odds with Teacher Siena. They must have decided to have a showdown. But what can they accomplish? It's not the old Supernatural Society anymore. The age of glory is over."

"We can't be certain. Iruki is a Servant, and Nade's capabilities can't be ignored either. The new member Shirone also has a record of dismantling Black Magician. It doesn't seem like it'll end just like this."

"Hehe. Black Magician was just lower-class kids anyway. Let's watch for now. If the Supernatural Society disappears, there'll be quite a war. Over the position of Estas's second owner."

"It won't be easy. The Women's Anatomy Research Society has been eyeing it for a while. The economics research society 'Golden Wheel' is also preparing to open the black market. It must be an opportunity to take a good share."

"Hmph. Our Doll Collection Society isn't to be underestimated either. I swear on my beloved Poco. The 'upper floors' of Estas will be ours."

Their eyes burned as they thought of the legendary upper floors of Estas. Those who knew about the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society and those who didn't. Everyone had different circumstances, but everyone expected this presentation to be a hit.

Meanwhile, the parties involved had no time to worry about such things. Only one thought filled their minds.

Why does a day have only 24 hours?

If a day were about 200 hours. No, if there were even just 48 hours, they could create perfect results.

But they weren't foolish enough to waste time on such fantasies. The three were proceeding with their work by dividing each day as finely as possible.

Nade, who had succeeded in developing a prototype, held a demonstration in front of Shirone and Iruki. The hologram device was a hemispherical machine that looked like an overturned rice bowl, with output terminals lined up around its perimeter. While Iruki set functions on the device, Shirone waited holding fiber-optic crystal orbs.

"Shirone, try casting photon output."

"Will it be okay? I'm not at a perfect level yet."

"We're the same. We need to do a demonstration first to find points to improve."

"Got it."

Shirone, gripping two crystal orbs in each hand, cast powerful photon output. Electricity was generated from the hologram device's output terminals, and a translucent human figure appeared. Though there were limits to the clarity that could be implemented electrically, Nade thought this was actually better. This was probably what students imagined ghosts looked like too.

"So this is a hologram."

The ghost was a soldier wearing ancient armor. His face was horribly mangled, and bones were visible in various parts of his body.

"The frame looks good for now. Iruki, it's your turn."

Iruki operated the controller Nade had made. Though there were only four buttons, combinations were possible, allowing dozens of patterns to be expressed. Each time he pressed buttons, the soldier's hologram demonstrated various actions. Watching the soldier's hologram walk around the warehouse, Iruki was satisfied.

"There don't seem to be any problems with the functions for now. We can proceed like this. Now what's left is Shirone. Will you be okay? On presentation day, the number of devices will increase tremendously."

Shirone, who had tried the demonstration himself, was also worried. While power could be recovered infinitely with Nade's electrical force, the problem was information transmission power. Even operating just one hologram device made his mind quite fatigued.

"I'll do my best. Still, the fact that maintenance time is increasing is hopeful. Then Nade will enter mass production now. Is Iruki's side finished?"

"No, I still have many parts to improve. If I consider even psychological changes, analysis would take a year. I'm thinking of probabilities above roughly 5 percent as practical variables. Still, I should be able to meet the deadline."

"Since I also have a prototype now, I need to make my decisive move from today. There's no time for rehearsal. Let's each be faithful to our roles during the remaining time."

Though he said this, everyone knew that Shirone bore the greatest burden. Even if several devices broke down, even if Iruki's functions were slightly wrong, the operation would somehow proceed. But if the output weakened, they wouldn't even be able to attempt the operation, and would face students' ridicule as well.

'Limit: 10 minutes. If I can't reach that point, the presentation will be meaningless.'

Returning to the warehouse, Shirone reviewed his training process so far. Mental strengthening occurred in the form of rebounds. There were rarely cases of gradual strengthening. A zigzag pattern of falls and rises. Moreover, the larger the fall, the larger the rise.

"The more I push my mind to its limits, the greater the strengthening range becomes."

This was Shirone's conclusion. If this method were applied to physical training, his body would break down within a month, but the mind had elasticity to withstand high levels of stress. Especially for Shirone, whose strength was endurance, there was no better training method than this.

Pushing himself to the brink of consciousness destruction.

Though it would involve considerable pain, this was the only solution to break through the current crisis.

'More, I need to pound my mind more!'

The size of the light source reflected on the wall was gradually growing larger.

* * *

It was the last day of the promise with his friends.

Time was approaching midnight. The warehouse where Shirone was training was bright as day with the light of photon output. Shirone, shooting photons with both hands, squeezed his eyes shut and bit his lips. His body gradually twisted and both legs writhed in pain. His consciousness seemed to be melting away. At this rate, he might go insane.

"Aaahhh!"

Shirone poured out every last bit of his mental power. The next moment, like turning off a faucet, the light disappeared. In the warehouse turned to darkness, the sound of knees hitting the floor was heard with a thud.

"Gasp! Gasp!"

Shirone crawled on his knees to press the button on the gear clock and check the time.

10 minutes 32 seconds.

"Ha, hahaha..."

It was an unbelievable result that brought out hollow laughter.

He had maintained photon output for over 10 minutes. This was thanks to experiencing thousands of mental rebounds during the short period of one month. His Spirit Zone had strengthened dramatically, and along with it, the power of his specialty magic had been raised to Class Five level or higher.

The iron door opened and Nade, whom he hadn't seen for days, entered. Having had to wander around the school wearing an invisibility cloak, his complexion looked much worse than before.

"Shirone, training is over. It's time for rehearsal."

Knowing that Shirone's target was too high, Nade deliberately didn't ask about his results. Shirone, who had been sweating profusely, threw the gear timewatch. Catching it, Nade's eyes widened greatly. 10 minutes 32 seconds. It was an astounding figure.

"You... did you really achieve it?"

Shirone gave a thumbs up and smiled as he said:

"Goal achieved. Let's do this spectacularly."

* * *

Alpheas Magic School Lecture Hall 7.

Though the presentation was at 5 PM, the area in front of the lecture hall was bustling with people from an hour before. As rumors spread and spread, most students had gathered to observe the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society's presentation.

"Wow! So many people. I've never even heard of this research society name before. I guess stars really are different?"

Ceriel admired the long line. Having advanced to the graduating class after Shirone's Speed Gun test ended, she didn't know much about research societies.

Amy also looked surprised. It was remarkable that Class Five, a research society with only three members, could attract so many people.

"They must have caused quite a few incidents. Anyway, the box office success is achieved."

"I didn't know Shirone would become so close with Iruki. When were they at each other's throats, and now they can't live without each other?"

When the two joined the line, advanced class students stirred. Senior students from the graduating class had actually come. Just seeing the Class Three badges on their collars naturally lit up looks of reverence.

"Wow. That's Amy-senpai. Would such a shabby presentation really warrant graduating class seniors to observe?"

"Idiot. Amy-senpai is Shirone's girlfriend. Ceriel-senpai also always stuck together with them when she was in advanced class."

"That's true, but... then what about those seniors over there?"

Students' gazes focused on one spot. Amy and Ceriel also looked back and showed surprised expressions.

"Oh my? Amy, look there. Cayden came?"

Class Two Cayden stood with his hands in his pockets. Around him were Richard of Alchemy, Electric Monster Lycan, Hersy of Sonic, and other Class Two powerhouses whose names were sacred to advanced class kids.
