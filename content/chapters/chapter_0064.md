However, even the Class Two seniors were merely supporting actors compared to the recognition of the man who had just joined the line.

A handsome man dressed in ready-made clothes with his hair neatly combed back was leisurely gazing up at the sky.

It was Ardino Fermi from Class One.

The atmosphere became solemn as Class One, the pinnacle of the magic school, appeared. Seriel also realized the gravity of the situation and whispered.

"Even if we're here, isn't it strange that not only Class Two but even Fermi came?"

"He didn't come because of Shirone. Do you know what the graduating class students who just arrived have in common?"

"Hmm, well? That they're hard to get close to?"

"Exactly. They must be from a research society that operates in the shadows. Like Black Magicians. Of course, they're on a completely different level from those."

"Ah, right. I heard the research society Shirone joined has quite a bad reputation too. But Fermi is really unexpected. I don't know about the others, but he's popular, isn't he? He's even kind."

"That's what makes it worse. He always seems to be plotting something. Anyway, let's ignore them. Among the graduating class, seniors don't mean anything."

All 30 graduating class students were competitors. Every year, 10 graduates leave the school, and classes are assigned based on graduation exam scores. Therefore, the current Class One students were those who hadn't made it into the top 10 in last year's graduation exam.

The reason they couldn't simply be dismissed as failures was because they stood at the top of the pyramid. In any competition, the skill gap narrows as you go higher. Among Class One students, there's hardly any difference in ability. Daily condition, strategic presence or absence, concentration and choices determine graduation versus elimination.

None of the students could ignore Fermi. Rather, they were surprised that the person currently at the forefront of the magic school had come to a Class Five presentation.

Fermi's appearance spread quickly through word of mouth, and by the time the presentation was approaching, there was a line that could fill the venue to capacity and then some, stretching tail to tail.

Finally, when the entrance opened, students rushed in. The front rows were reserved for teachers, and students filled seats in order of arrival. Amy, who had come early and waited, sat alongside Seriel close to the stage.

"What on earth are they trying to show to cause this commotion?"

No matter how she thought about it, this level of popularity was strange. It was extremely rare for Class One to come to an advanced class presentation. This wasn't just a simple presentation. In the tense atmosphere, Amy waited for Shirone to appear. The lights in the hall went out.

* * *

A single beam of light descended into the dark room. The spotlight swept across the stage thoroughly before illuminating a boy standing in the center.

"Good evening, everyone. Thank you for coming to the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society's presentation. I am Nade, serving as president of the research society. Today, we would like to introduce you to the human soul. Now, let us begin the presentation."

Applause poured out. The spotlight went out, and after about 3 seconds, the stage brightened like dawn breaking, revealing the ominous scenery of mountains at the back of the stage.

"The children have prepared quite a lot."

Alpheas spoke with a satisfied expression. Generally, presentations are evaluated at the teacher level, but this time Alpheas was also attending specially to observe Shirone's achievements.

On the other hand, Siena still felt no inspiration. While replacing stage devices with electric barriers instead of artificial objects was a nice idea, if the content was shoddy, no matter how wonderful the technology, it would be a failing grade for a research presentation.

Nade, who had moved to the end of the stage, provided narration.

"520 years ago from now. Before Alpheas Magic School was established, this place was a small slash-and-burn farming village. It was a time when people who had lost their country to wars of conquest were wandering around. Today, we want to tell you the story of a woman who entered this slash-and-burn farming village to escape the war."

After a blackout passed and the lights came on, Iruki, disguised as a soldier, appeared on stage limping.

"Graaaaaah! Hungry... hungry..."

Laughter erupted from various parts of the audience.

"Haha! What is that?"

"Graaaaaah, really? What kind of play is this?"

Nade supplemented the lacking parts through narration whenever Iruki had no lines.

The gist was this:

Soldiers had also come as refugees from the war of conquest.

But they were not in a living state.

They were hungry ghosts who had their bodies stolen by evil spirits and wandered the world before entering the slash-and-burn village after smelling the scent of living flesh.

After Iruki fully displayed the eeriness of the hungry ghost and disappeared behind the stage, Nade, now disguised as the male protagonist, appeared.

"Ah, my love Olia! Why must someone of your noble bloodline suffer in these mountains? If only I could, I would sell my soul to restore the brilliant glory, but it pains me that I cannot."

His vocalization and acting were at a fairly decent level. However, the children who had come expecting a presentation were bewildered when it really turned into a play. Moreover, when Shirone, dressed as a woman, came running onto the stage from the opposite side of Nade, they were nearly fainting.

"Noah! Noah!"

Wahahahahahaha!

The students burst into laughter without exception. Shirone, with blonde hair cascading down to his waist, really looked like a woman. His waist was tightly cinched to emphasize his figure, and something was stuffed inside his clothes to make his chest protrude.

"A-Amy."

The bewildered Seriel looked back at Amy. As expected, she was watching the play with a rotten smile.

Since Nade, the narrator, was participating as an actor, the two conveyed the situation through dialogue.

It was a simple plot.

Noah and Olia were from noble families who had promised their future together, but the war scattered their families, and they eventually entered the slash-and-burn village to continue their love.

"I missed you, Olia. My love. My everything. I love you."

"I love you too, Noah."

Shirone and Nade looked at each other and embraced around the waist. What would unfold next was predictable to anyone.

The play's highlight: the lovers' kiss scene.

Among the many spectators, the most excited person was definitely Seriel.

"A-are they really going to do it? Huh? Really? What should I do?"

Amy also felt unprecedented tension and gulped. It seemed unlikely that the boys would actually kiss, but if it was a play, you never knew.

As the audience's tension mounted, Shirone closed his eyes and Nade slowly brought his face closer.

"Kraaaaaaack!"

Suddenly, Iruki appeared from behind Nade and bit his neck. As screaming sounds echoed thunderously from the sound equipment, startled audience members screamed.

No one had expected Iruki to appear. It would be impossible to create such a performance with stage equipment alone. Shirone had written the script targeting this point. He thought he could surprise people using the invisibility cloak. As tension mounted, the audience gradually became absorbed in the play.

Iruki, having knocked down Nade, pretended to devour flesh. Sounds of bones crushing, flesh being chewed, screams, and cries of anguish mixed together from the sound equipment.

"No! Noah! Noah!"

When the soldier who had devoured living flesh disappeared, Olia held dead Noah in her arms and wailed. The story raced toward tragedy, and half-mad Olia poured out curses before taking her own life with a dagger she carried. At the sight of the man and woman who had died for each other, the students also maintained silence in a solemn atmosphere.

After a blackout passed, Nade reappeared on stage, having returned as narrator. Everyone was waiting for his narration when suddenly Olia got up and burst into mad laughter.

"Hehehehe! I won't forgive them. I'll kill them all."

Before the audience could calm their startled hearts, Olia indiscriminately killed people. Then, screaming as if her throat would tear, she disappeared offstage, and one story came to an end.

Nade walked to the center and continued his explanation.

"We discovered this story 6 months ago from now. It was thanks to an old diary we found while tracing the history of the magic school."

Nade pulled out a notebook. A 520-year-old notebook buried in dirt and worn. But in reality, it had been hastily created just a few days ago.

"Our members, who have expertise in paranormal science, immediately began investigation. And we realized a shocking secret that no one else knows. Namely, the fact that the vengeful spirits from that time are still wandering this school."

Dong. Dong. Dong.

A bell began ringing from behind the stage. Students listened to the familiar sound. It was the bell announcing midnight.

"Every night at midnight, hungry ghosts wander around. This is surely definite proof of the existence of souls."

The children frowned. Even after attending school for several years, they had never seen ghosts, let alone suspicious people.

"You have probably never seen a ghost. We were the same way. According to supernatural paranormal science, souls have the property of being visible only to the eyes of believers. This is because mental frequencies must match. This is precisely why we decided to hold a presentation. Having learned the history of the vengeful spirits, your frequencies are now properly tuned. From today, when the midnight bell rings, you will be able to witness ghosts wandering through the nine heavens."

Nade finally winked.

"If you're lucky, that is. This concludes our presentation."

As Nade bowed and disappeared behind the stage, silence enveloped the hall. There wasn't even applause, and the atmosphere was only cold.

The students shuddered with betrayal and emptiness. Calling it a research presentation and then doing nothing but a classical theatrical performance.

"What? It was just a joke? I thought they'd show us something amazing."

"We were stupid to have expectations. Honestly, how could they prove ghosts? We were completely fooled. Ugh, we came for nothing."

"It's Class Five level after all. Shirone and Iruki had a lot of talk, but when it comes down to it, there's no substance. Hey, let's go. We just wasted time."

Voices mixed with complaints could be heard from here and there among the students. Since they were people who studied while saving even their play time, the time lost to such a childish presentation felt precious enough to die for.

As students began leaving one by one, Mark and Maria came down against the flow and greeted Amy and Seriel.

"Senior, hello. How have you been?"

"Yes, it's been a while."

"What did you think of this presentation, seniors?"

Mark seemed equally bewildered. Especially since he knew of Shirone's genius, it was even harder for him to accept today's presentation.

But Amy didn't have anything particular to say either. There were no grounds for excuses or pretenses to wrap it up. What you saw was everything, and the presentation ended with this.

But Seriel was still on Shirone's side.

"They probably had something prepared originally but something went wrong. Time was tight or something. That's probably it. Right, Amy?"

"Anyway, the fact remains that it failed. I should have suspected when I heard he was hanging around with strange kids. Let's go too."

As Amy left her seat first, Seriel pouted.

"How can she be so indifferent to her boyfriend?"

"Haha! That's Amy senior's charm, isn't it? Maybe the person most upset right now is Amy senior."

Hearing Mark's words, Seriel's hurt feelings also subsided.

Even after students left the lecture hall, the teachers still couldn't leave their seats. Honestly speaking, they didn't even have a clue what to write on the evaluation sheets.

'What on earth were they trying to do with this nonsense? They should have rather done nothing at all.'

Siena in particular was tremendously shocked. To hold such a joke-like presentation in a place where none other than the principal was watching. Her head was throbbing, wondering how to smooth over this incident.
