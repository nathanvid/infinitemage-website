Siena threw down her evaluation sheet and apologized to Alpheas.

"I'm sorry, Headmaster. You came to observe in person."

"Haha. It was a difficult assignment indeed. Isn't that what supernatural paranormal science is all about? Don't worry about it."

"I'll make sure to give them a stern warning."

Alpheas raised his hand as if to say it was fine and walked toward the exit. But just before leaving through the door, he turned back to look at the empty stage. The corners of his mouth, hidden beneath his beard, turned upward.

'If it were going to end with just this much, they wouldn't have started at all. Isn't that right, Shirone?'

* * *

"Done. Phase 1 is safely complete!"

Regardless of the audience's reaction, Shirone's group rushed frantically to the research society. The real battle was just beginning.

"It definitely worked, right?"

"Yeah. I could tell just by looking at their eyes."

They had already anticipated that the presentation would end anticlimactically, given how high the students' expectations had been. But Shirone had actually hoped for this kind of situation. The more trivial people thought it was, the stronger the psychological accessibility became. This was precisely the point of the psychological trap he had planned.

Mass hypnosis.

The keyword was the bell chime announcing midnight. Once they understood the content, it didn't matter how childish it was. The keyword imprinted in their minds would guide them into fear.

"Shirone, it's all up to you now. If you succeed, we're good."

"Got it. I'll do some meditation here."

"You absolutely must succeed! We're counting on you!"

They had done their best for a whole month. Now the baton had been passed to the final runner, Shirone.

"I need to concentrate, so stay back."

Shirone declined Nade's attempt to massage his shoulders and sat down on a chair in a secluded spot. Six hours remained. Within that time, he had to bring his mental condition to its peak.

'One. Two. Three.'

Shirone deeply bowed his head and slowly proceeded with the sequence formula. Nade and Iruki carefully avoided even making breathing sounds as they quietly moved away.

The success or failure of this presentation depended on whether he had the mental strength to sustain photon output for more than 10 minutes. But the remaining members still had work to do.

Iruki had to install the remote control device for the hologram, and Nade had to maintain the core that Shirone would pour his photon output into. While everyone was busily working on their tasks, the day grew dark and midnight approached.

In the pitch-black darkness with no one around, Shirone's eyes snapped open. Having proceeded with the sequence formula for five hours, Shirone's mind could be compared to a well-sharpened blade. Shortly after, the door opened and Nade's quiet voice seeped in.

"Shirone, it's time to go."

Shirone rose from his seat as if nothing could stop him. Then, like a gladiator heading to the colosseum, he followed behind Nade.

* * *

The core of the hologram device was installed in the sewers flowing beneath the central park. More than ten optical fibers extending from the massive device went up to the surface, where they spread out through multi-adapters into hundreds of strands.

An operation employing a whopping 300 hologram devices. Shirone was impressed by Nade's mass production capabilities, but the pressure grew proportionally.

Though he had succeeded in maintaining photon output for 10 minutes, this was his first real battle. No one knew what unexpected variables might arise.

When 10 minutes remained until midnight, Shirone walked toward the mechanical device that was ten times larger than the prototype.

When Nade handed over the input-output terminal with a grave expression, Shirone grasped the crystal sphere with both hands. Iruki held a timepiece and kept track of the time. It couldn't be too fast or too slow. The hologram had to be activated at the exact moment the bell rang.

"Ready? We need to start now."

Shirone took a deep breath and nodded. Iruki raised his right hand while watching the clock. When the execution time came, his hand fell decisively. Simultaneously, Shirone's sequence formula began rising at tremendous speed. The power of light bursting from both hands was incomparably stronger than before. His friends were amazed at how much he had raised the level of his photon output in just one month.

'More, stronger!'

The light source grew so massive it seemed to swallow Shirone whole. Nade ran to the core device to check the transmission efficiency. At his expression, frozen in surprise, Iruki asked impatiently.

"How is it? What percentage?"

After remaining silent for a long while, Nade spoke in a trembling voice.

"17 percent."

"What?"

It was a much lower figure than expected. Where could things have gone wrong? But there was no time for analysis. If they couldn't pull it off now, everything would be over.

'The radius is too wide. This is impossible as is.'

Shirone had sensed it intuitively from the start. The moment he began casting photon output, an empty sensation rushed into his mind like pouring water into a bottomless jar.

The information transmission efficiency of the optical fibers was 18 percent. In that state, connecting them in parallel had tremendously weakened the transmission power.

Shirone output photons for several minutes. But no matter how hard he tried, the output efficiency wouldn't rise beyond 17 percent.

Iruki realized there was no need to try any further. Operating the device in this state would only cause most of the holograms to shatter like fragments.

After 5 minutes passed, Nade smiled. Though they had failed, he was proud of Shirone for reaching an impossible goal through tremendous effort. Everything was his own fault for the faulty design.

"Shirone, that's enough. We did well enough. Let's stop here."

Shirone didn't respond. Honestly speaking, he was so angry he could die. It was a project that Nade, Iruki, and everyone in the research society had put their hearts into with their utmost effort.

But this was the end? When they hadn't achieved anything yet, they had to admit defeat with tears in their eyes?

'How did we come this far only to...'

Shirone closed his eyes with a determined heart. He hadn't poured out everything yet. The light source remaining in his hands gradually swelled and began to cover Shirone's entire body.

"Don't tell me...?"

Nade realized what Shirone was thinking.

Immortal Function.

He had stepped foot once again into the forbidden realm where he could lose everything if he wasn't careful.

"Shirone! Stop! Don't do it!"

Nade and Iruki shook Shirone's body. But Shirone's mind, racing toward nirvana, couldn't be scratched by ordinary interference.

Shirone's light source had already consumed him and expanded outward. If left alone, something terrible would happen, and Nade cried out with a tearful expression.

"Shirone! Please stop! I can't lose you! We can give up on the research society! Please stop!"

Shirone's eyes snapped open at Nade's voice. Light was faintly leaking from Shirone's eyes, nose, and mouth as he stared fiercely straight ahead.

"Nade..."

"Yes, Shirone! Let's stop! Let's end it here!"

Shirone's lips curved up slightly.

"Now... I'm not afraid anymore."

The moment Shirone closed his eyes again, a massive light filled the tunnel. His mental power began spreading infinitely.

Now it was too late to stop him.

Nade and Iruki stepped back with dazed expressions. They could only desperately pray that Shirone would be able to return.

In the infinite realm, Shirone felt a nostalgic sensation.

The feeling of everything that composed him becoming meaningless. But this time, he never forgot the existence called "I."

'I won't turn away. I'll look straight at it.'

An unknown monster was flicking its tongue, trying to devour Shirone. Shirone recalled Armin's advice. Never turn away. Armin had personally demonstrated that having the key to infinity didn't mean everything would disappear.

'I'll overcome it. I will definitely... subdue it.'

The monster's maw revealed its pitch-black throat as it pounced. Even in that moment, Shirone didn't turn his head away and stared directly at the darkness within the throat.

"Graaaaaah!"

As his mind spreading into the world collided with the Spirit Zone's barrier, an intense headache surged. He had caught it. Shirone gritted his teeth and endured. The overwhelming energy that had surpassed his limits was all shot out as photon output.

"Shirone! Are you okay? Say something!"

"Check the output first!"

At Shirone's shout, Nade looked back at the core. Output efficiency 22 percent. The efficiency that hadn't budged even 0.1 percent had risen by a full 4 percent.

"Oh! It's rising, it's rising! Shirone!"

"Arrrrrgh!"

Shirone concentrated even more. The infinite mental power entering through the Spirit Zone flowed down his arms and was injected into the crystal sphere.

Nade screamed. Output efficiency 36 percent!

'More! I need stronger power! More!'

The Spirit Zone shook. Even its strong durability couldn't block the rushing mental power. It felt like hundreds of times compressed pressure ready to burst. His mind was one step away from exploding.

"Arrrrrrgh!"

Output efficiency 59 percent.

"Shirone! Just a little more! You can do it!"

Even the cool-headed Iruki was screaming. The needle of the measuring device began shaking back and forth as if caught in a storm.

Shirone transformed his Spirit Zone into defensive form. As the frames intertwined, he heard the illusion of something tightening with a grinding sound. The moment the power to withstand pressure and the resulting ejection force escaped through his hands, he felt a sense of deprivation as if the world had gone dark.

Output efficiency 87 percent.

"Urrrrgh!"

His whole body trembled as his brain shook madly. Shirone newly realized just how amazing a mage Armin was. Applying infinite power to reality was truly an insane act. One wrong move and he could lose his life, crushed by power even stronger than entering nirvana.

Shirone pushed all his mental power into the only open ejection port in his palm. Even though he had fully expanded the exit, the photon's power wasn't diminishing at all.

Output efficiency 100 percent.

"Arrrrrgh!"

The moment Shirone squeezed out his last strength, a red light came on the core's lamp.

Nade trembled before the unbelievable result. The starving monster that had only registered 17 percent even with the power to maintain photon output for 10 minutes was now screaming as if its belly would burst.

"Done, we did it! Iruki, start!"

Iruki, who had been watching in a daze, hastily grabbed the remote control device. With trembling hands, he pressed the button and light traveled up the lines to the surface. From there, it spread through hundreds of optical fibers like a spider web throughout the entire school.

Dong. Dong. Dong.

The bell chime announcing midnight rang out.

* * *

"Phew. It's already 12 o'clock. Time really flies."

Maria, who had been studying in her dormitory, closed her book and stretched languidly.

She heard the distant bell chime from outside the window.

Without realizing it, she recalled the presentation and hastily shook her head to erase the thought.

But the more she tried to forget, the more it bothered her.

Nade's words about hungry ghosts appearing to devour people wouldn't leave her mind.

"Ugh, what's this? Making me think about it for no reason."

Shirone already knew that even without hypnosis, people would imagine things on their own once a keyword was planted.

'If you match the soul's frequency, you can see ghosts?'

One thought led to another. Maria rubbed her body as it grew eerie and turned toward the bed. At the same moment, her heart dropped with a thud. Her pupils shook and an intense electric shock ran up her spine to strike her brain.

"Uh... uh..."

A rotting corpse was shuffling around inside the room.

Maria couldn't control her chattering jaw.

The soldier with exposed ribs turned toward her, raised his arms, and began approaching.

"Kyaaaaaah!"

A scream burst forth loud enough to shake the windows. But no one could hear her voice. The same screaming sounds were echoing through the corridors and from every room.
