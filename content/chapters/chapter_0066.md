**Crash!**

The vase that hit the wall shattered into pieces.

Amy, who had thrown the vase, pressed her arms and legs against the opposite wall, gasping for breath.

"What, what is this?"

The moment the bell rang, a real ghost had appeared. Was this the resonance effect Nade had mentioned? At first, she thought she was seeing hallucinations. But what she saw before her eyes was clearly a real entity.

"Grrrrrrr..."

The moment a sobbing sound burst from the ghost's throat, Amy activated her Schema and ran toward the door. When she flung the door open with enough force to break it, countless female students were screaming and running through the corridor.

Amy was horrified. Behind them, dozens of ghosts were running after them, chattering their jaws.

"Amy! Save me! Ghosts have appeared!"

Seriel cried out, tears and snot streaming down her face. Amy's face turned pale. She had never believed in ghosts. But when hearing scary stories, it was human nature to feel reluctant about going to the bathroom at night.

"Uh, uhhh!"

Swept up in the wave of people, Amy began running toward the outside of the building.

"Grrrrr..."

Strange groaning sounds broke the silence of the quiet training hall located at the foot of the mountain.

Ethella awakened from her meditation. As she sat up and turned around, a hideous, transparent figure was walking toward her. The thought that it was a ghost occurred to her, but no particular emotion stirred in the heart of an ascetic who fought against the world's evils.

Ethella opened her eyes drowsily and examined the ghost that had approached right in front of her. Then the ghost also tilted its head and looked at her. It was a moment that proved how accurate Iruki's equation was.

"Grrrrr..."

"Grrrrr?"

Ethella raised her hand with curious eyes and tried to press the soldier's nose. But naturally, her hand passed right through and came out the back of the soldier's head.

"Hah! Hah!"

Inside the frozen curtain of ice where water vapor had frozen, Siena was breathing heavily while pitifully covering her naked body.

On nights when she had duty, she would wash herself in the women's dormitory's public bath. But today, the moment she heard the midnight bell toll, her heart nearly jumped out of her chest from shock.

"What is this?"

The first thing that came to mind was the soul frequency. Then was what Nade said actually true? That couldn't be. But she couldn't deny what she was seeing with her own eyes.

"Grrrrr..."

A hungry ghost soldier penetrated through the ice barrier. Thanks to this, Siena regained her composure. It wasn't that she had figured out it was a hologram. It was the pride of a magician—there was no being that could neutralize her ice magic so easily.

"How dare something like you..."

Siena walked forward confidently. As expected, the soldier couldn't harm her at all and passed right through her.

The situation was immediately understood.

Siena discovered two devices installed on the ceiling and walls. From the hemispherical devices with a diameter the size of a gold coin, thin beams of light were shooting out.

Siena sighed and slowly left the bathroom.

The moment she stepped into the changing room, the water on her body froze with a crackling sound.

When she lightly shook her body, ice that sparkled like diamonds scattered in all directions. Before she knew it, not a single drop of water remained on her body.

"These guys really...!"

Siena's eyes narrowed fiercely.

* * *

Alpheas Magic School was turned upside down.

The windows that had been dark began lighting up one after another, and students were screaming and bursting out of doors.

The same situation was playing out everywhere.

The holograms, created by predicting people's behavior in advance, freely changed direction, and the students who had lost their minds were running blindly down the paths, not even realizing they had been deceived.

"Ahhhhh! Someone save me!"

"It's ghosts! Ghosts have appeared!"

The behavioral patterns that could be predicted when humans were gripped by extreme terror were surprisingly simple. Because they moved purely on emotion while their reason was paralyzed.

The lower-class children cried and called for their mothers, while the upper-class students, separated into boys and girls, were joining the crowds flowing in the largest numbers.

From the highlands, a crowd of graduating class female students, with male students scattered among them here and there, was pouring down like a tide.

The ghosts seemed to be chasing people randomly, but viewed from above, they were focused on gathering the masses in one place. And finally, all 400 students in the school had gathered in the central park to the north.

The students trapped between people and buildings finally realized that ghosts were swarming from all four directions—north, south, east, and west—and there was nowhere to escape.

"Kyaaaah! They're coming! Do something!"

"Ahhhhh! Come at me! Come on, you bastards!"

As everyone let out cries of terror, hundreds of soldiers simultaneously raised their swords and attacked them. The wailing children, screaming female students, and boldly stepping forward male students all squeezed their eyes shut without exception.

At that moment, light began emanating from the soldiers' bodies. Hundreds of bodies flashed like lightning, then were sucked upward toward a single point as if being drawn into the sky.

"What, what is this?"

The students' gazes all turned toward the top of the central building. Shirone was standing on the rooftop railing. Nade and Iruki belatedly climbed up and positioned themselves on either side.

"Thank you to everyone who attended our presentation."

The students looked at them with dazed expressions. They still couldn't grasp what situation they were in.

The teachers came rushing into the park in a hurry. It was a scene where the entire faculty had mobilized, regardless of whether they taught lower-class, upper-class, or graduating class students.

Siena pushed through the crowd, fuming.

"You guys! Come down right now! What do you think you're doing! You've turned the school into complete chaos!"

Nade winked and greeted her.

"Ah, Teacher Siena. It's a beautiful night."

"Beautiful night, my foot! Hurry up and come down! If I have to come up there, I might kill you, so come down quickly!"

"Still, this is a presentation after all. We'll finish it before we go."

A presentation? What kind of presentation at this time of night? The children murmured at Nade's words.

"What? So it was all fake?"

"We were tricked! Damn it! I thought my heart was going to fall out!"

Most students were still in a daze, but the few who quickly grasped the situation pointed fingers at Shirone's group and poured out criticism.

"You con artists! How dare Class Five nobodies trick us? This isn't a presentation or anything!"

"Those guys should get zero on their performance assessment! You bastards, you're finished now! Where in the world are there ghosts? How could you pull such a scam?"

Even in front of the barrage of criticism, Shirone's group maintained relaxed smiles. Then, when the curses and criticisms showed no sign of stopping, Nade raised his hand to calm them down.

"The Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society has proven the existence of ghosts through this presentation. Yet you all seem unwilling to believe it."

"Of course! Do you think you can gain recognition by arbitrarily creating ghosts that don't exist and tricking us? You'll definitely fail."

"Right! This is just a mean-spirited prank! Anyone can trick people like this! If I put my mind to it, I could also..."

A Class Four male student stopped speaking and blinked his eyes. Then the other children also seemed to realize something as they began looking around and murmuring.

"But... how exactly did they do it? Do you understand?"

"No, I can't even begin to guess. It really seemed alive. Plus, they fooled all 400 students in the school."

The children realized this incident wasn't a simple prank.

Creating hundreds of holograms was impressive enough, but how they moved them was still a mystery.

"Those guys... what kind of trick did they pull?"

As unrest arose among the students, Siena frowned and closed her eyes. To be honest, even she couldn't yet figure out exactly what method they had used.

It was impossible to immediately recall that Nade's excellent mass production and engineering technology, photon output drawn from the infinite realm, and tens of thousands of lines of Servant Syndrome equations had been combined.

"Heh heh heh heh. It seems we've been had this time."

The teachers all turned around.

Alpheas was bursting into hearty laughter while looking up at Shirone's group.

Siena shook her head and approached him.

"Headmaster, this is no laughing matter. I don't know what or how those children did it, but there's evidence they illegally trespassed into forbidden areas. Some kind of hologram device..."

"Oh? So even Teacher Siena doesn't know?"

Alpheas thought that made sense. Even he wouldn't have immediately realized that information transmission technology was involved in this strategy if he hadn't specialized in light magic.

But was this really possible at a student level?

In some ways, it must have been like gambling for Shirone's group as well. Alpheas wanted to praise that aspect.

Siena honestly admitted it.

"It's embarrassing, but I still don't quite understand. However, I don't think those children have convinced the teachers just because we can't understand the mechanism."

"Heh heh, I misspoke. Being had doesn't mean that."

"Pardon? Then...?"

Alpheas kept his words to himself while looking up at the students.

"Let's watch for now. The presentation doesn't seem to be over yet."

The students were still arguing, trying to figure out the trick Shirone's group had used.

The central park instantly transformed into a massive debate forum.

But the more they shared opinions, the deeper into the labyrinth they fell. The Class Four students were particularly displeased. Not only had they been completely fooled by their juniors' trick, but they couldn't even figure out the mechanism, which was no small blow to their pride.

"Hmph! No need to think about it! They must have pulled some ridiculous trick. The point is that this presentation is bogus! Showing us ghosts that don't exist and claiming you've proven them? Don't make me laugh!"

The Class Four students united in agreement.

"Right! This method is unacceptable! This isn't paranormal science, it's just a show!"

As criticism grew louder, Nade stepped forward as their representative and asked them.

"Everyone, can you still not acknowledge the existence of ghosts?"

"Of course! Ghosts? This is just a type of illusion magic! It's not real ghosts!"

"Then I ask you this: If you really think that way, why are you all here in this place right now?"

"What? Well, obviously...!"

Starting with the student's silence, quiet spread.

Among the hundreds of students, no one could refute Nade's words. If they thought ghosts didn't exist, why had they run away like fools?

The answer was simple: somewhere in their hearts lay thoughts that couldn't deny the existence of souls.

"The emotion you're feeling right now is the very essence of supernatural paranormal science. Humans live their entire lives with questions and curiosity about the unknown. If there's no need to know something just because it hasn't been verified yet, then what reason would there be for intellect to exist? I believe this is precisely why the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society must have a place at Alpheas Magic School, the cradle of intellect."

The students became speechless.

Real ghosts hadn't actually appeared, but what did that matter?

What was important was that everyone here thought ghosts might exist. And if they thought that way, someone had to make an effort to uncover the truth.

For the first time, Nade's words made the students seriously consider this presentation. It wasn't a prank meant to simply disrupt the school. The Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society had presented a perfect presentation in their own way.

"This concludes the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society's presentation. Thank you to everyone who observed us until this late hour."

Shirone's group bowed politely. The surroundings were quiet, and no one spoke.
