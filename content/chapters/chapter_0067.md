But a short while later, students who felt an inexplicable sense of exhilaration rising in their hearts began bursting into laughter.

"Puhahaha! This is really a masterpiece! Yeah, you guys did it!"

"Right! Honestly, I've been interested in this kind of thing for a long time too! Please hold more interesting presentations in the future!"

"I haven't sweated like this in ages. You guys won! You're the best!"

The teachers were flustered by the students' sudden change in attitude, but Shirone had already anticipated this. Any rational human being has curiosity about the essence of things.

Where do we come from and where are we flowing to?

Perhaps that is the most important question for humanity. And that was precisely why the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society needed to exist.

Alpheas nodded with satisfaction.

"To show the invisible while keeping it invisible. So there was indeed such a method. The children did splendidly."

"Principal, then are you considering allowing the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society to continue?"

"Hmm. That's not something I can decide alone. Well, how about it? If anyone wants to raise objections to those children's argument, speak up now."

None of the teachers stepped forward. Even Siena had no choice but to keep her mouth shut this time.

Honestly speaking, she felt like she had been properly schooled by her students. The Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society must exist. The hundreds of students gathered here were proving that fact.

Thad raised an objection.

"But what if violations of school rules are discovered later? There will be quite a backlash. There are unsettling aspects to approving the research society as is."

Several teachers, like Siena, had confirmed illegal intrusion into forbidden areas. When multiple people pointed out the same issue, a faculty meeting was held on the spot.

Siena spoke first.

"It's true that the children broke school rules. However, I think this is separate from whether the research society should continue to exist."

The teachers looked puzzled when she, who had led the dissolution effort just moments ago, came to defend the research society.

But Siena thought this was enough. It was the promise she had made with them. Shirone's group had fulfilled the required conditions, and all she had to do was acknowledge their achievement.

Separate from the teachers' discussion, members of the underground research societies were secretly conversing in a secluded area of the park.

"Even a rotten fish has its day, they say. It's not over yet. Those graduating seniors left behind quite audacious juniors, didn't they?"

"There won't be a need for war. The Supernatural Society's dominance will continue for a while. We Ant Language Research Society have decided not to get involved."

"Hmph! They're just Class Five anyway. They'll make it to the graduating class someday, but I won't be at this school by then."

"That's not something you can be certain about, is it? If you fail this year, you might be competing with those guys next year."

"What? So you're saying I'm running away because I'm scared of those brats?"

"Everyone stop. It's ridiculous for us, who don't even see each other's faces normally, to be doing this. If you want to face them, then do it. Of course, our Hide-and-Seek Research Society won't get involved."

"Saying that while you'll be watching every move. You guys would even jump into sewage to hide, wouldn't you?"

"Let's stop here. People are watching. Just gathering like this only damages our research societies' reputations."

The leaders who ruled the school's underground agreed to call it there and headed toward the graduating class building. Siena's brow furrowed as she caught sight of them moving together.

'Ugh, those pathetic losers.'

She was sick of them just looking at their faces. The worst troublemakers who had tormented Siena relentlessly from the lower class through the advanced class until entering the graduating class.

The reason she couldn't do anything about them was because they abused their heaven-given talents to disappear like ghosts.

'Just how many kids like that are there in this school? This is all because they recognize ridiculous research societies.'

How could a teacher deal with the ingenious tricks passed down from senior to junior, and from those juniors who become seniors to their juniors?

The reason Siena had tried to disband the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society wasn't so much because she hated Nade's group, but because she wanted to cut off the root of evil from the beginning.

'But it ended up like this after all.'

Siena clicked her tongue and pushed through the crowd. Then she shouted to Shirone's group standing on the rooftop railing.

"I announce the results from the faculty meeting."

The students' applause and cheers died down.

"The Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society was scheduled to be disbanded soon. This was because there had been no official activities for a year and the membership was insufficient. However, starting with today's presentation, after deliberation between Principal Alpheas's opinion and a majority of teachers, it has been decided that the three-person research society led by Nade, the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society, will continue to exist for the time being. But..."

Siena was about to continue when she choked up. Getting more and more irritated no matter how many times she thought about it, she pointed and shouted.

"You three are suspended for one week! It's suspension, you idiots!"

Wahahahahahaha!

The children doubled over with laughter. While the idea to prove the research society was excellent, they were charged with installing unauthorized mechanical devices at the school in the process.

Shirone, Nade, and Iruki stood with their mouths agape. Then they looked at each other. Their lips gradually curved upward, and joy filled their eyes.

"We did it! We succeeded!"

"Uahahaha! We did it! We saved the research society!"

They didn't care about suspension at all. Watching her students embrace each other in excitement, Siena was dumbfounded.

But having given their all, they had no regrets whatsoever. Because they had poured out everything without leaving even 1 percent behind, they were genuinely happy with the current result.

"Hahaha! Hey, congratulations! Keep working hard!"

"Where's your research room? I'll come visit sometimes!"

Students offered congratulatory words. Among them were Mark and Seriel, Shirone's ardent followers.

"Wahhh! Senior Shirone is amazing as always! I predicted from the beginning that it wouldn't end like this! As expected, Senior is one step above me! No, two steps above!"

"Right. I never dreamed that the research society's fate hung on this presentation. Anyway, you pulled it off brilliantly again, didn't you? Right, Amy?"

Amy should have been the happiest at this moment, but unexpectedly, she wore a sullen expression.

"What's so happy about getting suspended? Why are you doing such pathetic things? You should be studying quickly to get into the graduating class instead."

Seriel looked lovingly at Amy, who was clumsy with expressions. She couldn't help but understand Amy's desire to spend school life in the graduating class together with Shirone.

"But isn't it cool? Of course, I could never do it if you told me to, but everyone thinks about it at least once. The thought of wanting to amaze the world."

Seriel looked at Shirone with envy.

There wasn't a trace of worry to be found on Shirone's face as he laughed brightly, receiving the children's cheers.

Longing filled Amy's eyes. In fact, she knew it too. That she was the person who wanted to stand next to Shirone more than anyone else right now.

But she shook her head as if turning away from her emotions.

'Right, I don't have time for this if I want to graduate. I will never look up to you.'

I want to be with Shirone. I want to climb to that high place and smile the happiest in the world. Suppressing such thoughts, Amy turned to leave.

'So... hurry up and follow me, you fool.'

4 AM.

It was the deep of night when even the night-shift staff had gone home and all students and teachers were asleep.

Shirone's group was lying on the grass of the central park where the historic presentation had taken place, looking up at the stars.

The children's cheers and the bustling noise had disappeared, but they still seemed to hear phantom sounds in their ears.

Nade said in a hoarse voice.

"We finally did it, guys."

"Yeah. But I feel a bit sorry for Shirone. I get detention like it's a daily meal, but it's your first time, isn't it?"

Shirone chuckled. He didn't care at all.

"But it was fun. So much fun."

"Right, it was the best. Will I ever experience a day like today again in my life? I still can't forget people's cheers."

"The three of us joined forces, so it should have been at least that much. Either way, we carved new history into Alpheas Magic School."

Shirone sat up abruptly.

"Besides, it's not just a bad thing. We gained a lot too. My photon output level increased tremendously from this presentation. At this level, I think I could make it even in the graduating class."

"Same here. I gained knowledge about optical fibers, and above all, I experienced mass production processes by myself. Honestly, it was tremendous study. This is all thanks to you guys."

"Same for me. I gained a lot by applying the behavioral patterns of 400 people in practice. It would have been absolutely impossible if Shirone hadn't pulled out the Immortal Function."

"What are you talking about? You're the amazing one. Without the behavioral equations of savant syndrome, the students would never have been fooled."

"If we're going to argue like that, Nade suffered the most. Installing hundreds of mechanical devices without error. That concentration was really amazing."

Shirone's group, who had been chattering excitedly, realized something and fell silent at the same time. A somewhat awkward breeze passed by. Nade lay back down after sitting up and said.

"Let's stop. What's the point of praising each other?"

"Right. We shouldn't become frogs in a well. It's natural to enjoy our success, but we mustn't be careless."

Shirone looked at the stars that seemed ready to pour down.

"I want to climb higher. I need to become the star that can shine the brightest."

Iruki felt the same way.

"It seems like we've done everything we can while fooling around. It seems like it's time to climb up. To the graduating class."

Nade did a tumble and jumped up.

"Good! Then let's set a new goal! Advance classes as quickly as possible! And graduate at the same time! Let's have fun even after we go into society!"

Shirone and Iruki nodded.

"Good. We'll keep running without stopping until then."

"Keke. It's been a while since my motivation has been burning like this."

The three put their hands together vigorously and cheered.

Someday they would become the greatest magicians. With that resolution, their eyes sparkled like stars as they looked up at the night sky.

The brightest, unique star.

The North Star was looking down at them.

##  At the Summit (1) 

Shirone collapsed and fell asleep as soon as he returned to his dormitory. Getting a week's suspension was unfortunate, but he was too mentally and physically exhausted to feel such emotions.

A day passed just like that.

The morning piano sounds, the sun hanging in the midday sky—none of it had anything to do with the suspended Shirone.

"Hey. Shirone. Shirone."

At the sensation of someone shaking his body, Shirone frowned and opened his eyes. Two blurry silhouettes wavered, then he saw Nade and Iruki's smiling faces.

"Mmm. What?"

"You're really something. Still sleeping?"

"I don't know. I'm tired. Go away."

"Don't be like that and get up. We can't attend classes anyway. Instead of that, let's go have some fun."

"Have fun?"

"Iruki knows a casino where they give free drinks and there are lots of pretty women. Since things turned out this way, let's go make some real money."

The moment Shirone heard about a casino, he didn't even want to respond.

"Aren't you guys tired? I'm dying here."

"We slept all day too. You've been sleeping for 27 hours now. Don't be like that, let's just go for three days. With Iruki's savant abilities, making money would be instant!"
