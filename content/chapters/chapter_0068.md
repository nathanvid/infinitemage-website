Shirone knew that so-called experts got stripped down to their underwear in places like that. Of course, with Iruki's Servant ability, no one could match him when it came to probability calculations, but there was a reason people called it gambling. Probability was just probability—to win at gambling, you needed the instincts of a gambler who could sense when to strike. He could clearly picture Iruki gradually winning money only to lose it all in one go.

"I'm not going. You guys go ahead. I don't do gambling."

"You don't have to gamble. They say there are pretty girls who pour drinks and massage your shoulders. You really won't go?"

Hearing that made Shirone even less inclined to go.

"Uh, sorry. I'm really too tired. I need to keep sleeping. Have fun."

Once the word "sorry" came out of Shirone's mouth, there was no changing his mind. When you thought about it, Shirone was the one who had accumulated the most fatigue while preparing for this presentation. While Nade and Iruki also lacked sleep, their work had been divided between physical labor and intellectual tasks.

On the other hand, Shirone, who had to raise his photon output level, had to continue high-level training that simultaneously drained both body and mind for a full month. Moreover, at the end he had entered the infinite realm and poured out his mental strength, so it was natural that his mind and body were weakened.

"Alright, I understand. Then get plenty of rest. Anyway, we'll be back, so just know that."

"Yeah. Win big and come back. Buy me something delicious."

"Hahaha! Don't worry! When you wake up, we'll have magically become rich!"

Hearing the door close, Shirone buried his face in his bed again.

*Saying you'll become rich when you're already rich, what a fuss...*

Shirone fell back into deep sleep.

* * *

That night.

"Hngh. Hnngh."

Shirone tossed and turned in his sleep, breaking out in cold sweat. The nightmare that hadn't come when he had fallen asleep like fainting was rising to consciousness again now that his sleep time was full.

"Hnngh..."

Shirone grimaced and shook his head left and right. In the vast universe, humans were nothing. That empty sense of deprivation wrapped around Shirone like an intense shock.

This time too, the nightmare was being sucked into a single point. Time flowed backwards and reached the beginning of the universe. Light appeared, and that light became a trembling thread, then changed to bubbles that filled Shirone's vision. Only light. And in the next moment, a powerful explosion erupted in the void of nothingness.

"Haaaagh!"

Shirone sat up. His wide-open eyes were still staring at the afterimages in his memory. Only after his sweat-soaked pajamas conveyed their damp feeling did he slowly turn his head toward the window.

It was morning, with the sound of chirping birds.

"Phew. I thought it might just pass this time."

He had inevitably had the nightmare. A strange sensation wrapped around his entire body, making him shiver.

But Shirone was no longer afraid.

He had heard the cause from Armin and had managed to exit the infinite realm by his own will on the day of the presentation.

Having gained some control over his power, Shirone calmly observed the phenomena happening to him.

*The universe I see in dreams. That's definitely a scene representing the beginning of the universe. And gauge symmetry.*

Though he lacked logical information, he felt like he was vaguely getting a grasp on things. It was probably information processing happening in his unconscious. Remembering Armin, who had said he would realize it himself, his mind settled and the supersensory perception disappeared.

Shirone went into the bathroom. Having slept so deeply he didn't even know how many days had passed, his condition was quite good. While brushing his teeth, he tried to remember and it seemed like Iruki and Nade had stopped by.

*Was it a dream? Or did they really go?*

The faces of the two who said they would go to the casino and hit it big came back hazily.

*I should have gone with them. What am I going to do alone now?*

While brushing his teeth and leaving the bathroom, Shirone suddenly looked back at his bed and stopped what he was doing. Small dust particles floating above the bed were rotating. Since the window was closed, it wasn't a convection phenomenon.

Forgetting about brushing his teeth, Shirone ran over with foam still in his mouth. Looking closely, they were definitely moving. He reached his hand toward the center of the rotation. The moment he thought he felt nothing, suddenly supersensory perception struck him intensely.

"Hnnnngh!"

Shirone spat out the toothpaste foam and bent over.

What could it be?

It felt like directly touching the nerve of a pulled tooth—for the first time, he felt like he had confirmed something he already knew.

*This is it! Something I already know but don't know the name of. But what is this?*

Shirone frantically gestured at the empty air. But he no longer felt that strange sensation. Calming his mind, Shirone went back into the bathroom, washed his body with hot water, and came out. Even during that time, he kept thinking about the phenomenon he had discovered earlier.

*It's not wind, not air pressure, not temperature. But how can dust move?*

It wasn't just floating. It was definitely moving in a rotational form due to some force.

After being lost in thought for over an hour, Shirone felt frustrated and changed clothes to go outside. Since it was class time, there wasn't a single student outside the building.

Feeling an unfamiliar sensation, Shirone headed toward the main gate. Since he had received a week's suspension, he was free to do whatever he wanted for the remaining four days. Since it was already spilled milk, Shirone decided to use this time as rest after special training.

*But where should I go?*

The first thing that came to mind was his own home. Thinking of his parents' faces, he felt a strong desire to go.

*No, that's ridiculous.*

It was only half a day's journey by carriage, but he had no justification. He couldn't just go home saying, "Mom and Dad, I got suspended." And visiting the Ozent family would just be awkward with neither Rian nor Reina there.

"Ah, that's right!"

Shirone suddenly realized his destination and snapped his fingers.

It was the bookstore.

Of course, the school library had more than enough books, but buying books from a bookstore had long been Shirone's dream.

Suddenly remembering how happy he had been as a child when his father bought him an old book, a smile formed on his lips.

Though he had been happy with one book, in his heart was the desire to buy more books.

But now he could do it. Thanks to the considerable allowance Temuran sent monthly that had accumulated.

If he bought books in the commoner district, even spending just a little, he could fill a basket with books.

*Come to think of it, this is the first time buying them. My own books.*

Borrowing from the library wasn't bad either, but book-loving Shirone had a strong possessive desire too.

Having made his decision, he quickened his pace. In an instant, he passed through the noble district and entered the commoner district.

The street he had often visited riding his father's cart as a child was still there unchanged. Shirone patted his gold pouch and walked confidently into the bookstore. The lady recognized Shirone. He was a child who would stand for hours looking inside whenever he came to the city, so his face had remained in her memory.

"Welcome... Oh my, isn't that Shirone?"

"Hello, ma'am."

"My. You've grown so I almost didn't recognize you. I haven't seen your father lately either, so I thought you'd moved to another city. He used to buy a book every time he came."

"He won't be coming anymore. That's why I came to buy them myself."

"I see. You still love books. Go ahead and look around."

"Yes. I'll browse then."

Shirone smiled pleasantly and walked around the bookstore. Price tags were attached wherever books were stacked, and from what he saw, books in good condition were expensive regardless of content.

Few commoners could read, but in a big city like Creas, the population numbers meant business was still decent.

But as expected, there were more novels with good sales than academic books, and the occasional academic texts only covered basic fields. He could see that the books in Alpheas Magic School's library were much more advanced than expected. Though there were no books related to his major, since he liked all books anyway, he looked around at various things before buying a novel with a mage protagonist.

It seemed to be quite popular since several copies were available, graded as high, medium, and low quality with prices set accordingly. Having money to spare, Shirone chose the cleanest new book and offered gold coins. Since it was a bookstore for commoners, prices were cheap, but books were originally precious items. Moreover, since it was a new book, the price was ten times that of the lowest quality.

"Oh my, buying something so expensive? Are you running an errand for someone?"

"No. Actually, this is my first time buying a book. That's why I wanted to splurge a little and read a clean one."

"I see. How admirable. Not many people spend money on books. Anyway, read it diligently. That's how you become smart. You need to be smart so you don't make your wife suffer when you get married later."

The lady, completely unaware that Shirone attended a magic school that was the cradle of geniuses, launched into a speech with the pride of a bookstore owner. But even that seemed to make Shirone happy as he gladly listened and came out carrying his book.

*This is my book.*

Not borrowed, not one someone else had read, but my very own book. Just feeling the weight of the book made his heart race like a child's.

"Huh? Isn't that Shirone?"

At the voice calling his name, Shirone looked to the side. A group of children were gathered around a cart. Looking carefully at their somewhat familiar faces, his eyes widened greatly.

"Huh? Altor? Martin? Even Lumina?"

They were children from the slash-and-burn village he had played with as a child.

"Wow. It really is Shirone?"

The children all rushed toward Shirone. Most were the same age, with at most a year or two difference. But their builds had changed dramatically since they'd last met. Especially Altor, the leader of the village children, had grown into a giant that even adults would find hard to handle. Only Martin, who had originally been small, was similar to Shirone's size.

Altor grabbed Shirone from head to arm.

"You rascal! What the heck happened? You didn't visit even once for years. When I asked Vincent, he only said you lived in the city."

"Hahaha. Sorry. That's how it worked out."

Though his head was spinning from their greeting style after so long, Shirone was just as happy to see them. Martin, whose front teeth protruded like a rabbit's, looked at Shirone's appearance and said admiringly.

"Wow. You've made it big. Anyone would think you're a noble."

"Really? I wouldn't know."

Shirone was puzzled by the comment about looking noble. He had never thought of it that way. But it seemed that living through the Ozent family and at the magic school had unknowingly given him the scent of nobility.

Lumina, the only girl in the group, said.

"Shirone always looked noble anyway. In any case, I'm glad you seem to be doing well."

"Yeah, thanks Lumina. You've become pretty too."

Lumina's face turned bright red. The Lumina Shirone remembered was a little child with many freckles and chubby cheeks. But now, aside from her skin being a bit darker, her freckles had disappeared and she had slimmed down into the complete appearance of a young girl.

Altor burst into loud laughter.

"Your lying has gotten worse, Shirone! Well, even before, none of us could match your smooth talking. What's pretty about this tomboy?"

"Quiet! Who are you to evaluate me as a tomboy or whatever?"

When Lumina got angry like never before, Altor became awkward.

"No, I was just joking..."

"Forget it. I don't want to talk to you."

"Fine! Don't talk to me. I'm embarrassed to be seen with a girl like you anyway!"

Shirone felt good as old memories came flooding back. Though it looked like they were fighting, this was exactly the daily life of the slash-and-burn village children.
