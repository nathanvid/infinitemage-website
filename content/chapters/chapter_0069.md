"By the way, Shirone. What have you been up to lately? What kind of work are you doing in the city? Are you working at a shop or something?"

"Huh? No, well..."

Shirone decided to tell them the truth. He knew his father had kept quiet about it, but when directly asked, he couldn't bring himself to lie to them so coldly.

"Actually, I'm attending a magic school."

"Whaaaaaaat?"

The children all widened their eyes and screamed in unison.

It was unbelievable. Of course, they had always known Shirone was different from childhood, but for a mountain hunter's son to enroll in a magic school...

"H-how did that happen? Is it really true?"

Shirone was surprised that the children were more shocked than he had expected. To calm them down, he deliberately spoke with casual bravado.

"Haha. I was just really lucky. I worked as a librarian for a noble family's library, and fortunately, that household looked favorably upon me and helped me get enrolled."

Upon hearing this, the children became even more dazed.

No matter how much he had worked as a librarian, nobles couldn't possibly do that much for a commoner.

It was natural that people who didn't know how arduous the process Shirone had gone through to get here would find it incomprehensible.

"A-anyway, that's amazing. So you're learning magic now?"

"Wow! Magic! Can you use magic? Huh? Try it! Show us!"

As the children all clamored excitedly, Shirone had to break out in a cold sweat for quite a while to calm them down.

"Well... I'm still in a low class so I can't do much yet. Besides, using magic outside of school is against the school rules."

Altor looked at Shirone with suspicious eyes. Honestly, he couldn't believe it. From childhood, Shirone's handsome appearance and character had inspired awe in the children. Even so, the reason Altor could become the leader was because he had the physical strength that was most important to commoners.

But what about now?

Shirone had become a student at a magic school that only the highest nobles attended, while he was still just Altor from Slash-and-burn Village.

"If you're attending magic school, why did you come here? Shouldn't you be in the middle of studying right now?"

"Oh, well... I just got some vacation time. I took a difficult exam a few days ago, so I wanted to rest a bit."

This time he had no choice but to lie. If he said he had been suspended, it would reach his father's ears. Even if it was for a good cause, his parents would surely be disappointed.

Most of the children seemed to believe him. Since they had never attended school, they easily assumed that schools might give vacations.

Lumina grabbed Shirone's collar and said, "If it's vacation, how many days do you get off?"

"Hmm, well? About 3 days?"

"Really? Then are you going home?"

"Haha, no. The semester is ending soon, so I'm planning to go home then. My parents are probably busy too."

"True. Three days would barely cover the travel time."

They, having similar parents, knew better than anyone how busy mountain hunters were.

Martin said, "So have you decided where to go? Where are you planning to sleep?"

"Hmm... well, I haven't really decided anything yet."

Lumina's face lit up as she exclaimed, "Really? Then come with us! You used to sleep over at our places a lot before."

Shirone was tempted by that suggestion. Even if he returned to school, he was suspended so he couldn't borrow books from the library, and all he could do was lie in his dorm and kill time. He also didn't want to spend the night alone in this place where he knew no one.

"Would that be okay? Can I come?"

"Hohoho! What are you saying? We still gather at friends' houses to sleep over every other day."

Shirone remembered. Accustomed to communal living, they were friends and siblings, lovers and family to each other.

"Alright then. I'd like to see the uncles after a long time too."

"Alright! Since we've sold all our goods, let's head out! Let's have a hearty drink!"

Altor wrapped his arm around Shirone's head and walked toward the cart. At the much stronger force than usual, Shirone groaned.

"Ow ow. That hurts."

"Hahaha! You're still so weak like that, how will that work? To become a great wizard, you need physical strength too."

Shirone knew that this behavior from Altor was his way of establishing hierarchy and reclaiming his authority as leader. That's why he wasn't offended. Having lived his whole life as a mountain hunter's son, Shirone understood their way of life.

Altor lifted Shirone onto the cart in one swift motion. No matter how small he was, lifting an adult man was impossible without considerable strength. As Shirone stared blankly, thinking his childhood friend had become a monster, Altor patted Shirone's head and burst into laughter.

"Welcome back, Shirone! Let's drink until our noses are crooked tonight!"

* * *

Riding the cart into Slash-and-burn Village, Shirone felt moved by the scenery he hadn't seen in a while. Green sprouts were emerging in the fields lined along the mountain ridges, and smoke was curling up from the chimneys of mountain houses strung along the ridgelines. People tending to the slash-and-burn fields spotted the cart coming along the path and called out.

"Martin! Just getting back?"

"Yes, uncle! Shirone came with us too!"

"What? Shirone? What about Vincent?"

"Uncle Vincent didn't come. But uncle, do you know? Shirone is attending magic school now!"

"What did you say? He's going around eating?"

"No! Not eating around, he's attending magic school!"

"Kekekek! What nonsense."

"..."

Martin shut his mouth and the uncle went back to weeding his field. Altor could understand the uncle. Even he couldn't believe it himself, so how could someone who had spent his whole life working the land believe it?

Lumina pouted her lips.

"What? Why won't he believe us? Shirone, don't worry. I'll spread the word later."

"Haha. That's not necessary."

Altor said, "Uncle Vincent didn't say anything either. Don't meddle unnecessarily and keep your mouth shut."

Like a true leader of the slash-and-burn village children, Altor knew the power of words. If by any chance Shirone was lying, Vincent's position would become difficult.

'If our dealings with Uncle Vincent get cut off, our family would take a hit too.'

After putting the cart in the communal warehouse, Altor led the children to the only shop in Slash-and-burn Village that sold alcohol. It was just dirt floors with some pillars set up and a few tables arranged - a side business run by the herb gatherer's wife.

"Auntie, I'm here."

"Welcome, Altor. Oh my, are you Shirone?"

"How have you been, auntie?"

"Yes, well. Vincent said he was working in the city, so you must have met there. Anyway, welcome."

The children skillfully pushed three tables together. Altor, seated at the head, placed an order.

"Beer for everyone first, and the usual snacks."

Shirone felt the passage of time keenly. When they used to hang out before, they were all children who couldn't even touch alcohol. But now they sat maturely with their legs crossed, gulping down beer. Compared to them, the children at magic school were still babies.

"How about it, Shirone? Do you drink much?"

"Huh? Oh, no. I've never drunk before."

"What? Looking at you now, you're still a little kid. You probably don't even have hair down there yet, do you? Puhahaha!"

The children burst into laughter at Altor's joke. But Lumina, being a girl, kept a straight face.

"What kind of thing is that to say to a friend you're meeting after so long? Really, with such a crude mouth."

When she openly took Shirone's side and scolded him, Altor's face turned slightly red.

'Well... it's been like that since before.'

He had known since childhood that Lumina liked Shirone. But now they weren't all children anymore. The one with strength gets the beautiful woman. Altor thought that Lumina's partner should be himself, the next village chief. Still, since his joy at the reunion was greater, his unpleasant feelings were quickly swept away by the alcohol. Shirone was also happy to meet his friends after so long. The beer he was drinking for the first time unexpectedly suited his taste, and the cheerful atmosphere continued.

"Do you remember when Sister Hauran threw herself at Shirone?"

"Hey. Why are you suddenly bringing up that story? Don't!"

Shirone, getting tipsy, waved his hands to stop Martin.

"What's wrong with it? It's already in the past. Besides, Sister Hauran got married last year and isn't even here anymore."

"Oh, really? That's a relief then."

The children burst into laughter at Shirone's words, holding their stomachs and pounding the table. As the atmosphere heated up, Lumina took advantage of her drunkenness to stick close to Shirone.

"So what kind of woman is your ideal type, Shirone?"

"Huh? Well, I've never really thought about it."

Altor found Lumina's flirtation unpleasant, but since there was no particular way to stop it, he deliberately addressed Shirone.

"Shirone. But are you really attending magic school? Then you should at least be able to do simple magic, right?"

"Hmm. Well, actually, I started learning magic late so I'm behind the other kids. Magic itself is such a difficult subject. It's not that I can't do it at all, but it's also prohibited by school rules..."

Even if he could do magic, he was still strictly a student. Unless one obtained a formal wizard certification, using magic outside of school was strictly forbidden by school rules. Exceptions would be if one's life was threatened or if another person's safety was in danger.

Of course, most students didn't follow the school rules, and the school knew there was realistically no way to stop them, but school rules were made for their own reasons.

Shirone had broken the arms and legs of thugs he met in an alley when he was only 12 years old. Even when Nade had used lightning magic at the restaurant recently, if the opponent had pushed just a little harder, it could have escalated into a big fight.

Magic wasn't simple force. It was tremendous power that drew forth the forces of nature through human will.

Shirone's specialty, photon output, didn't possess even 1g of physical force, but he knew that the moment he demonstrated it, fear and awe would sprout in the children's hearts. He didn't want to show magic at a drinking party and make the atmosphere strange.

Martin chewed on dried jerky and asked, "If it's that difficult, is it possible you might not become a wizard?"

"Of course. Actually, there are far more people who don't become wizards than those who do."

"Really? Then if you can't become a wizard, how will you make money?"

"Huh? How..."

Since he had been running single-mindedly toward becoming a wizard, he had never seriously thought about what would happen if he failed.

Making money to sustain one's livelihood was the greatest concern of children this age, so when Shirone couldn't answer, they tilted their heads.

"Then who's paying for your tuition? Are the nobles paying for that too?"

"Yeah. For now I'm receiving support."

The children's eyes widened.

"Wow! Really? How much do they give you? Have you saved up some money? How are you going to get married? Have you dated any nobles?"

"No, I've never thought about things like that..."

"Then have you been to those places? You know, those shops with lots of women. Nobles frequent those places, don't they?"

"Well... some people do that, but it's not necessarily like that..."

Altor's expression soured at the children's enthusiastic Q&A. Hadn't it become as if Shirone was the leader?

The hierarchy in Slash-and-burn Village wasn't established just to beat up and knock down the weak kids. Without a strong leader maintaining control, people develop greed for wanting a bigger share.

For them, isolated from society, discord meant the collapse of the group. The reason for establishing leaders from childhood was also to prepare for when they would grow up and take responsibility for the village.

Altor said in a sour voice, "That's enough. Why do you have so many questions? Are you all envious of Shirone's life?"

"Of course we're envious. The nobles are giving him money."
