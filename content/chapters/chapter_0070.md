"Even so, if you can't become a mage, it's all for nothing. Isn't that right, Shirone?"

"Hm? Oh, of course."

"Depending on someone else's money to do something means entrusting your life to others. It might not matter if you succeed, but if you fail, nothing remains. Shirone, you shouldn't do that either. Even if it's for your parents' sake, you should secure a way to make a living before learning magic. Are you going to live off your parents forever? It's not like you're strong enough to do physical labor either."

Even if he didn't become a mage, he had learned knowledge that would help him find employment. Since he was a commoner anyway, if he just swallowed his pride, there would be many places that would call for Shirone. But it was true that he had never considered what would happen if he failed, just as Altor said.

How could that be? Was it desperation? Arrogance? If he couldn't become a mage, what kind of life would he lead?

His stomach churned. Failure. Anyone could fail, and Shirone was no exception. The realistic questions from the children of Slash-and-burn Village made Shirone's heart grow cold.

When the atmosphere grew heavy, Altor suggested a game. It was partly a proposal to regain his authority as leader.

"Come on. Enough of the complicated talk. Hey, Shirone. Want to arm wrestle with me for old times' sake?"

"What? Me?"

"Yeah. You used to be surprisingly tough back in the day. Let's see if you still have that toughness left."

The children pounded the table, encouraging the match.

"Ooooh! Warrior versus mage! The match of the century!"

As the drinking atmosphere heated up, Shirone also set aside his gloomy thoughts and regained his smile. To arm wrestle with someone who could easily lift a grown man—pride aside, it was simply absurd.

"How about it? Loser pays for drinks?"

When Altor placed his thick forearm on the table, Shirone also extended his hand without backing down. When there was a bet involved, whether he won or lost, accepting was a matter of male pride.

"Fine. Let's do it. But no going easy on me."

"Of course not."

The moment their hands clasped, Shirone felt like he was gripping a rock. If he used photon magic to knock him over, the drinks would be free, but that was nothing more than amusing fantasy.

Martin volunteered to referee.

"Alright, get ready... Start!"

Shirone squeezed out all his strength with everything he had. But Altor's brute force surged like a wave, and regardless of his will, his hand went to the opposite side. Having crashed under the table, he rubbed his elbow. It wasn't just brute strength—it was monstrous power.

"Ow ow ow. You're really strong."

"Wow! That's Altor for you. Shirone's a mage, but you knocked him down in one go!"

Magic and arm wrestling had nothing to do with each other, but to the children, the title of mage seemed to carry considerable weight.

"Of course! Altor even hunted a bear before!"

Having regained his authority, Altor finally laughed heartily.

"Haha! Shirone, you've really gotten weak, haven't you? You weren't this bad before. This turned into a strange bet. I'll just pay for the drinks myself, Shirone."

Lumina approached and helped Shirone up. Her eyes were filled with apologetic feelings.

"Shirone, are you okay? Really, Altor. How can you be so rough?"

As a member of Slash-and-burn Village, she couldn't not know why Altor had knocked him down so forcefully. But since Shirone was also accustomed to mountain life, he wasn't hurt by it.

"I'm fine. But Altor's really gotten strong."

The moment Shirone stood up, his gold coin pouch fell. As the opening gaped, the lovely gold coins rolled out with a clatter. The eyes of the children from Slash-and-burn Village widened.

"Huh? These are gold coins—real gold coins!"

"What? Where, where! Wow! Really! There are five of them!"

Even the children at the end of the table gathered around, mesmerized by the gold coins. Using gold coins in Slash-and-burn Village was rare even for adults. To children who only earned pocket money through odd jobs, the golden coins seemed almost sacred.

"You have tons of money. Why are you carrying around five gold coins?"

Shirone embarrassedly picked up the gold coins as he spoke.

"Just in case. There's a book I really want to buy, and it would be troublesome if I didn't have enough money."

"Well, books are expensive."

The children knew Shirone loved books. Even when he used to come with Vincent, he always had a book tucked under his arm. The people of Slash-and-burn Village, who couldn't read, had no interest in books. But just from the number of fallen gold coins, they could tell what an amazing life Shirone was living.

"Shirone. So you can spend this however you want? Since it's yours, you can buy whatever you want, right?"

Shirone made a troubled expression. He had never spent money carelessly before. As Altor said, it was money received from others. But the children seemed shocked just by the fact that he had such an enormous amount of money. Thinking he might wound their lives, he carefully chose his words.

"There's hardly any need to spend money. I skip most meals because there are so many classes at school."

"Come on. But you can still pay for drinks, right? Since you lost the bet."

"The bet? Oh, right."

Shirone had clearly heard Altor say he would pay, but pretending not to know after showing the gold coins would likely hurt his feelings even more. Altor too, though he knew little, wasn't ignorant, so he left the atmosphere to the natural flow.

"Got it. I'll pay. Since I lost."

The children cheered at Shirone's words.

"Yes! So we're using gold coins, right? Shirone, could you give me the drink money in advance? I've actually never touched a gold coin before."

"I'll handle the payment. Paying with a gold coin has been my lifelong dream!"

"No! I'll do it!"

Before they knew it, the children's leader had become Shirone. Lumina watched Altor worriedly. As expected, his face showed his miserable feelings.

The reason he didn't get angry was the same as Lumina. Having watched Shirone since childhood, she knew. Shirone hadn't changed at all. Then and now, he was a good child who knew how to think of others first.

"Stop it! You guys act so petty over one gold coin! When will you grow up? Let's talk about something else now."

At Lumina's scolding, the children quietly returned to their seats. Shirone was grateful to her.

Quick-witted Martin changed the topic.

"By the way, did you hear? It appeared in the back mountain again yesterday."

"Oh, I heard too. At this rate, there won't be any mountain animals left. Just how long is it planning to keep eating?"

"It's probably a pregnant CowBear. Their appetite is enormous."

CowBear was the largest gray bear among bears. Especially when females were pregnant, they ate twice their usual amount, making them troublesome animals for hunters.

Having done quite a bit of hunting himself, Shirone showed interest.

"A CowBear came all the way here? Don't they usually inhabit the other side of the mountain range? That must be really troublesome."

"Tell me about it. My dad's a hunter, but he keeps coming back empty-handed these days. The mountain animals are nearly extinct, so there's nothing he can do."

"Then couldn't you all gather together to catch it? CowBears aren't particularly violent, so about five people should be enough, right?"

"There aren't enough people since it's logging season. Everyone's gone to cut trees, so no one will help. But looking at its movement range, it probably won't give birth here. They say if we wait about a week, things will return to normal."

"I see. It must be hard for your father too."

Altor's eyes sparkled as he snapped his fingers.

"Hey, Bread. What if we catch that CowBear ourselves?"

"What? Us? Wouldn't that be dangerous?"

"What do you take me for, saying such things? I've hunted red bears, notorious for their viciousness, until I was sick of it. A mere CowBear is nothing."

Altor planned to restore his damaged honor through this hunt. His physical strength and hunting skills were the only areas where he could maintain superiority over Shirone, so in a way, this was an opportunity given by God.

"Hey, what do you say? Let's all help Bread."

"If you'd do that, I'd be grateful."

If he couldn't bring back game, his family would have no choice but to starve. Knowing this fact, the children couldn't ignore Bread's situation. Besides, wasn't Altor the very person who had caught red bears, small in size but the most vicious of all?

"Good! Then let's go catch that CowBear tomorrow!"

"Wooooo! My blood is boiling! Bread, don't worry! This big brother will put an arrow right in the bear's forehead!"

"Idiot! Can you even do that? We just need to dig traps and leave it to Altor."

"We leave tomorrow morning! Shirone, you're coming too, right?"

Altor asked with sparkling eyes. To regain his position as leader, Shirone absolutely had to come along. Knowing this fact, Shirone nodded, thinking it actually worked out well.

"Alright. I learned some things from my father too, so I should be able to do my part."

"Great! Now then, cheers!"

The foaming beer mugs clashed in the air.

The next morning at dawn.

Shirone woke up early and prepared for the hunt.

While the children would divide the professional tools among themselves, each person had to prepare their own basic equipment.

He coiled the rope loosely so it wouldn't tangle and hung it on his backpack, then checked his bow and arrows.

He packed cloth and glue for making torches, and brought large nails and a hammer.

He put spare arrowheads in a leather pouch and carefully packed dried food and a whistle in case of getting lost.

When he lifted the backpack, the familiar weight made him feel pleasant.

Thinking that the man Shirone wasn't dead yet, he opened the door to find all the children with their equipment gathered in front.

"Hey, Shirone. You're too late. You're getting slow. Hehehe."

Shirone laughed sheepishly. Indeed, people actively working in the field were different.

"Haha, sorry. It's been a while, so I'm out of practice."

"Anyway, let's go. We need to return before sunset."

Altor took the lead while Shirone followed in the middle group with Lumina. Martin guarded the rear.

When they arrived at the CowBear's habitat, the sun had risen.

Lumina started a fire and began cooking. Breakfast was corn soup with melted goat cheese and bread. Shirone dipped the hard bread thoroughly in the soup and gulped it down.

"Delicious. Lumina's cooking skills really should be acknowledged."

"Hehe."

Lumina smiled shyly. Thinking that in the past she would have made a fuss telling him to earn his keep properly, the children had definitely changed a lot. But it was a good change, and Shirone was relieved that his friends were doing well.

"If everyone's finished eating, let's slowly get going. It seems like it's probably up there."

Altor led the children toward the mountainside. His prediction seemed correct, as every tree had bear territory markings. Martin pointed to a tree with particularly severe claw marks.

"Look at this. The tree is completely gouged. It must have incredible strength."

Altor approached and carefully examined the claw marks.

"Hmm. This level is no problem. The paws don't seem that big either."

"Still, isn't it dangerous?"

"Bears' strength is well-known. They're faster than you'd think too. But CowBears are rather slow in their movements. With this many people, we can definitely hunt it."

Shirone examined the claw marks belatedly. And he slightly frowned at a sense of unease. Though they were just scars carved in the tree, he couldn't imagine a bear making territory markings there.

'Strange. It doesn't seem like it was done with strength. Rather, it looks like something very fast and sharp struck it...'

Altor drew his bow at this point. With an arrow loaded, he crouched and looked back.

"Anyway, we should start from here, so be careful. Let's go up a bit more and set up traps."

The children following Altor climbed the mountain with quiet steps. Perhaps because this life was routine for them, they all moved skillfully.

Shirone entered his Spirit Zone and sensed in all directions. A 40-meter diameter was inferior to a skilled hunter's vision, but since he felt uneasy, it wouldn't hurt to be careful.

As they reached near the summit, quite unpleasant energy was transmitted through synesthesia. When Shirone stopped walking and tried to identify the source of the feeling, Altor looked back and asked.

"Shirone, what are you doing? We're not setting up traps here."

"Altor. Something seems strange."

"What's strange? I can't sense anything."

Altor cut off Shirone's opinion in advance. No matter how smart Shirone was, he thought he was the expert when it came to hunting. But Shirone didn't bend his will and left the formation to walk somewhere. Altor followed with an angry expression. Independent action in the mountains could put everyone in danger.

"Shirone. If you keep doing this, just go back down... Ugh!"

Altor was horrified at the sight that unfolded before them. Even Shirone was speechless at this moment. Nausea welled up, and the smell of the goat cheese he had eaten earlier flowed back up.

"What... what the hell is this?"
