Mountain beasts hung from tree branches like laundry, torn to shreds. Among them were even ferocious carnivores.

The children who arrived late covered their mouths. Just not screaming was enough to prove they had what it took to be mountain folk.

"Ah, Altor. What happened here? Are you saying a CowBear really did this?"

Martin's voice was trembling, and Lumina had turned her head away, squeezing her eyes shut as if she couldn't bear to look. Shirone made his decision faster than anyone.

"Let's go down. This doesn't seem like something we can handle."

"No, let's go a bit further. We need to know what this is."

"Altor! This is serious!"

"That's exactly why we should go! If something like this comes into the mountains, all the prey will flee! Then we'll starve to death!"

"I know that, but it's too dangerous. Let's go down to the city and report it instead."

"Report it? Have you lost your mind from hanging around nobles? Who do you think cares about mountain folk?"

"You idiot, that's exactly what I'm saying! This isn't some trivial incident they can ignore. Look at those beasts over there. Can't you see how dangerous our situation is right now?"

Martin interrupted.

"Sh-Shirone. Altor. Look over there."

The bushes were rustling and shaking. Shirone and Altor simultaneously nocked arrows and aimed toward the sound.

Rustle. Rustle.

The swaying leaves heightened the tension. The children each drew their weapons and waited for the mysterious presence to reveal itself. When the beast slaughterer finally showed itself, Shirone and Altor's arrows pointed much higher than their original target.

"This... this can't be..."

Altor's voice, which feared no one in terms of courage, was filled with terror.

"Grrrrr."

A wolf-like monster over two meters tall crouched and glared at the children. Its chest muscles bulged like balloons while its waist was narrow. Its arms hung down to its knees, and its hook-like claws were as long as a human's pinky finger. Its knees bent backward in reverse joints, but it supported its body on long cat-like paws that made it look agile.

Martin barely managed to squeeze out his voice.

"Mo-monster."

Evolutionary scholars believe that humans and other animals derived from a single source organism. But monsters were beings that arose from completely different source organisms phylogenetically. That's why monsters couldn't be fully analyzed based on animal characteristics alone. They were stronger and more agile than other animals, and even possessed intelligence.

'Wolf appearance with bipedal locomotion. A Worg.'

Shirone recalled knowledge from books. Worgs had poor language abilities but could express hundreds of emotions through sound, and their tribal lifestyle meant they possessed social skills as well.

With powerful claws, fast mobility, and strong muscles, they were balanced types that even monster hunters preferred to avoid fighting when they formed groups.

'But why did it appear here? I thought there were no monsters in this region.'

Only one scenario came to mind. Worgs defeated in tribal warfare had relocated and drifted to this area. As if proving Shirone's thoughts, the Worg's body bore wounds in several places. Its fur was matted with the blood of countless beasts, making it impossible to guess how much blood it had shed.

The children's ragged breathing reminded Altor of his responsibility. As their leader, he had to find a way out of this situation somehow.

'Still, it's a living creature. A hit to the forehead would be instant death.'

Altor took a deep breath and aimed his arrow. Even though it knew it was being targeted, the Worg calmly placed its hand on a tree and watched its prey. This was proof of its intelligence.

'Die! You filthy beast!'

Altor's arrow flew like the wind. But the Worg simply tilted its head slightly and easily dodged it. Then it made a mocking sound, scratching its throat.

"Grrr. Grrrrr."

The children were horrified by the dynamic vision that allowed it to dodge arrows at close range. But this was just the beginning of their despair.

CRASH!

The Worg shattered the tree trunk with jaw strength alone. Then it let out a roar at Altor.

"GRAAAAAAH!"

"Damn it! Run!"

The moment he saw the brute force that tore off the log, Altor lost all desire to nock another arrow.

Everyone ran toward the summit, but Shirone remained until the end and shot an arrow at the Worg.

"GRAAAAAAH!"

Shirone's provocation made the Worg even angrier. But thanks to that, the children gained time to escape.

The Worg leaped with agile movements and struck down at Shirone's head with its claws. At the same time, Shirone's body turned into a flash of light and shot into the air.

"Grung?"

Shirone, who had appeared in mid-air through teleportation, looked down at the Worg from above. Being deep in the mountains made it difficult to cast teleportation consecutively.

'Not here. I need to get to the summit.'

Altor supported the struggling children and ran and ran. Choosing not to go downhill was the right decision. Going down in this situation would have meant everyone tumbling down.

"Faster! Run faster!"

The children, who had thrown away their weapons and baggage, climbed the mountain with their tongues hanging out, practically crawling. Lumina shouted.

"Where's Shirone? I don't see Shirone!"

"He's buying us time! Just keep climbing!"

Altor urged the children on. He was worried about Shirone, but worry wouldn't help anything in their current situation. First, he had to protect at least the children.

"GRAAAAAAH!"

The moment the children reached the summit, the Worg's roar came up from the downhill path. Altor's brow furrowed. The monster coming this far meant Shirone had either escaped or died.

"Damn it! There's nowhere to hide!"

The mountain summit was a clearing close to flat ground with a cliff at the end. The cliff was only 20 meters high, but there was no time to climb down the wall.

"Altor! The monster's coming!"

The Worg climbed up, clawing at the ground. Its rock-like muscles reflected clearly in the sunlight. Altor, separated from the children, voluntarily became bait.

"Over here! This way!"

But with cliffs on all sides, there was nowhere proper to run. Altor turned around in despair. Even his daily-trained muscles were nothing more than a young child's strength before a monster.

"Damn it! I don't know anymore!"

Just as he raised his fists, thinking he'd rather die fighting than just die, the Worg disappeared before his eyes.

"Run quickly!"

Altor looked to the side with a surprised expression. Though he hadn't even seen it coming, Shirone was somehow rolling around with the Worg.

"H-how?"

Altor tried to run to Shirone, but when Shirone's form turned to light and disappeared again, he stopped in his tracks.

"Wow. Th-that's magic, right?"

The children, encountering teleportation for the first time, were amazed. No matter how fast the Worg ran, when Shirone flashed with light, it instantly lost its target in a series of events.

"GRAAAAAAH!"

The Worg howled, unable to contain its fury. But the monster's rage wasn't one-dimensional like a beast's instinct. The creature that thought any meat was the same turned its body and ran toward where the children were.

"AAAAAH!"

The children, pale with fear, scattered in all directions. Only the tender-hearted Lumina couldn't even think of running and froze in place.

"Lumina! Run!"

"Ah... Ah..."

Shirone extended his hand toward the Worg. He combined the omniscience and omnipotence of photon output. But where Lumina was located was outside the radius of his Spirit Zone.

'Oh no! It doesn't reach.'

Shirone converted his four-way method to target form. As the zone changed into a cross shape, the Worg was finally caught in his synesthesia.

'Photon Output!'

Light flashed out and hit the Worg's eyes. The Worg covered its eyes and let out a roar at the sudden brightness.

"Got it! Shirone finished it off!"

Because the light beam's impact was tremendous, the children thought the Worg's face had been smashed. But knowing that photon output had no physical force, Shirone ran toward the Worg and shouted.

"Lumina! Run quickly! There's no time!"

Lumina threw her body hastily. But her legs had already stiffened and she simply fell to the ground like a log. Realizing that Shirone's magic had no power, the children could only stamp their feet.

"What do we do? It seems like it only shoots light."

"GRAAAAAAH!"

The Worg, having regained its sight, pounced on Lumina. Its sharp hook-like claws caught on her hair tie. The rubber band snapped and Lumina's hair came undone. At the same time, Shirone grabbed the Worg's waist and cast teleportation. A flash that shot into the sky began falling toward below the cliff from a high altitude.

"Shirone! No!"

"GRAAAAAAH!"

Every time the Worg tried to struggle, Shirone repeated teleportation. Setting the direction of teleportation toward the ground was a dangerous attempt forbidden even at school, but it was unavoidable to keep the Worg's attention focused.

'What do I do? What do I do here?'

Even falling like this wouldn't kill the Worg. In a photonized state, there was no mass, so the falling energy would be zero at the point where teleportation ended. But giving up magic and falling meant he couldn't handle the Worg's struggles.

'Mass. I need mass...!'

At that moment, Shirone felt chills run through his body. It was a powerful supersensory perception he had never experienced before. Countless fragments of thoughts flashed through his mind. The beginning of the world. Gauge symmetry. The vortex hovering over the bed. Mass is not force. The power of existence that opens the universe's activity. The crack that breaks symmetry.

The sense of deficiency that Shirone felt when he was reconstructed from the infinite realm expanded into human consciousness was the cause of the supersensory perception.

The discord between omniscience and omnipotence.

The name of the lost fragment was gravity.

When omniscience was established, omnipotence, which had made its presence known through nightmares until now, fit together precisely. With the conditions for magic activation fulfilled, Shirone changed the Worg to a photonized state and threw it downward.

"Graa...!"

Before the scream could even end, the Worg's body collided with the ground and bounced up with a thud.

Shirone, who landed with Rainbow Drop, glared at the Worg.

It was instant death. The reason it received enough impact to break bones in a photonized state was because the light was heavy.

"Hah. Hah."

Matter is not born with mass. There is another element that transmits mass to matter and then disappears.

An unknown particle that humans cannot observe.

That was the omniscience that Shirone realized in the infinite realm and the reason gauge symmetry appeared broken.

"Got it. I finally figured it out."

Shirone clenched both fists tightly. His body trembled with emotion and his heart swelled to the point of tears.

"KYAAAAAAAH!"

At that moment, the children's screams were heard from above the cliff. Shirone regained his composure and looked up.

"No way...?"

Come to think of it, Worgs were monsters with social skills. Even if they were defeated in tribal warfare, the probability of roaming alone was low.

"No!"

Shirone cast teleportation and flew up above the cliff. Upon reaching the summit, his body froze just like Altor's group. Dozens of Worgs were surrounding the area. The entire tribe had been moving together.

'I underestimated their social nature too much.'

He could hear the children's sobbing voices.

"Wh-what do we do? We're all going to die now."

"I haven't even gotten married yet. I don't want to die like this."

Shirone didn't want to die either. And now he had at least the minimum weapon to fight the Worgs.

"It's okay, guys. I'll figure something out."

"How? Don't do that and just run away yourself. You can escape with magic."

"It's okay. From now on, I won't be breaking school rules."

Shirone walked toward the pack of Worgs.

"Shirone! It's dangerous!"

Altor called out, but he ignored it. He simply reviewed his recent realization while glaring at the Worgs.

The silver-furred Worg that appeared to be the chieftain tilted its head dismissively, and a Worg that seemed to be his right-hand jumped out.

"GRAAAAAAH!"

Shirone concentrated photons in his palm.

'This much won't do. More... more...'

The light gathered in his hand gradually became pale and finally emitted an intensely brilliant white light that was dazzling to look at. Meanwhile, the Worg was rapidly closing the distance to Shirone.

While measuring the distance to his enemy, Shirone concentrated on changing the properties of the photons gathered in his hand. As the children's screams intensified, the Worg that had finally arrived swung its claws.

Shirone's body was suddenly pushed back a full meter. Having created distance with short-range teleportation, he opened his eyes wide and cast magic.

'Now!'

When he threw the compressed photons, pale light struck the Worg's abdomen. The photons compressed into a sphere form pushed the Worg away while extending again as a golden line.

"GRAAAAAAH!"

The Worg let out a roar and was sent flying. It collided with another Worg and rolled down the mountain.

The children's eyes widened at the unbelievable reality.

"Th-that's impossible. Did you see that? That huge monster just flew dozens of meters away."

"How is that possible? Is that what magic is?"

The Worg chieftain who saw Shirone's magic wrinkled its nose bridge. Its intelligence was quite remarkable, as human language leaked out.

"Ma... gic... user..."

Countless Worg eyes focused on Shirone. But Shirone was only staring at the chieftain.

He felt like he could win.

The mass contained in the photons was minute, but the impact of weight carried at near-light speed was beyond expectations.

Moreover, this was truly the Unlocker's magic that only Shirone in the world could use...

The Photon Cannon.
