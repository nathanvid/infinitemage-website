Photon Cannon.

Though the mass contained in light quantum was minuscule, the impact force striking at the rapid speed of photon output was not something a mere monster could withstand.

The Orc chieftain's eyes blazed with fury. Having fought countless battles against humans, he knew just how dangerous a mage could be.

"Alright! He must be scared! Shirone did it!"

Martin shouted. But Altor thought differently. What they were facing now wasn't just some beast—it was a monster. Though they were said to have intelligence, their bestial nature wasn't something to underestimate either.

"This won't end here. No matter how strong Shirone is, he's still human. Pack hunters never retreat just because they've lost one or two members."

Just as Altor analyzed, the Orc chieftain had no intention of retreating. Though a mage's abilities were destructive, the group's violent nature wasn't intimidated by just one person.

"Grrrrr, kill... him..."

"KRAAAANG!"

The bursting roars of the Orcs shook heaven and earth.

'I can do this. If I just keep my focus, I can win.'

Shirone flew up using teleportation and bombarded the ground with Photon Cannon. Flashes struck down like hail. Even if they weren't hit directly by Photon Cannon, the shockwaves generated from the ground struck the Orcs hard.

Even so, the Orcs' momentum wasn't diminished in the slightest. When forming a group, they were such a warlike race that even Ogres, called the kings of the forest, would give them respect.

Ignoring their fallen comrades, individual Orcs leaped up and swung their claws at Shirone. Shirone hastily landed on the ground. Seven more were waiting there, looking for an opportunity.

Shirone converted his Spirit Zone to the Four-Direction Style's offensive form. The moment the Spirit Zone's spikes touched the Orcs, rapid-fire Photon Cannons were unleashed. Blindingly intense flashes extended outward, and the Orcs struck by photons were sent flying back where they came from.

"Wow, that's incredible... Shirone."

The children wore expressions of amazement. To think a human could fight dozens of Orcs on equal terms. They had thought the heroic tales of valor circulating among people were just boastful exaggerations. But watching Shirone's battle made it seem like any story could be believed as fact.

"Hah, hah."

Shirone's breathing became rough. The moment he cast rapid-fire Photon Cannons, his consciousness nearly flew away. Even his mental strength, capable of sustaining photon output for over ten minutes, found it difficult to endure. This was because Photon Cannon was fusion magic combining light and mass.

A mage has one slot where a battery can be installed. It's the same principle as humans being unable to concentrate on two things simultaneously. If it were Iruki with savant syndrome, double casting would be possible, but excluding such special cases, even the highest-level mages could only use one magic at a time.

Therefore, mages who specialized in pure magic of a single attribute were uncommon in the professional world. Most combined two, or even three attributes to maximize the effects of individual spells.

Siena's Ice Tornado, combining cold and wind, and Thad's Fire Sun, combining light and flame, were representative examples.

Fusion magic had the advantage of maximizing momentary efficiency, but required correspondingly high mental strength. Having cast such magic repeatedly, it was natural for Shirone to feel fatigue.

'This is bad. I don't think I have many shots left. I probably can't take them all down.'

Orcs were different from street thugs in an alley. A beast's sense of smell could read prey's emotions like a ghost. If he showed even the slightest sign of fatigue, they would immediately try to tear his limbs apart.

Indeed, the Orc chieftain was still showing hostility even after losing a third of his tribe.

Realizing Shirone was tired, the Orcs' second wave charged. Though similar in number to the first wave, the feeling was completely different compared to when his mind was intact.

Shirone desperately fired Photon Cannon. A mass of photons buried itself in the belly of the Orc running at the front.

"KRAAAAA!"

The huge body was pushed back, scraping along the ground. But unlike before, it didn't fall and managed to hold its ground by planting both legs firmly. Shirone felt dizzy. He never expected the power to drop this much.

Having gained confidence, the Orc chieftain ordered a full attack.

"KRANG! KRANG! KRANG!"

The Orcs also sensed victory and rushed forward en masse.

'Since it's come to this...'

All Shirone had left was Immortal Function.

But could he endure it?

This was on a completely different level from when he had cast photon output before. He couldn't know what kind of aftermath would come from casting fusion magic, which had high mental strength consumption units, in the infinite domain.

"Grrrr!"

The moment he opened Immortal Function, pressure built up in Shirone's mind. He thought his head might burst.

"AAAHHH!"

Shirone steeled his heart and opened his mind. Along with the feeling of his ego loosening, tremendous power rushed in.

The moment the Spirit Zone filled with light, it exploded intensely. Mass waves pushed back the Orcs while golden fragments scattered.

Shirone floated a sphere of light in his palm and shot it forward with all his might. Photon Cannon extended as a white flash, devastating the entire area. Firing barrage after barrage without reducing output, the Orcs were swept away as if by a broom.

But he couldn't maintain this state forever. If infinity was an ocean, Shirone's mind was a stream. Immortal Function was like a barrier blocking between them. He was punching holes to draw and use seawater, but if time continued, the barrier would collapse.

Since different amounts of mental strength must be paid depending on the magic, mages choose the most cost-effective magic for each situation.

Magic with effects far superior to their cost is called "Over Power" in magical society, with representative examples being the time magic Stop, invisibility magic Invisibility, alchemy magic Injection, and healing magic Heal of Almighty.

So what about Photon Cannon?

Shirone thought it was close to Over Power.

Excellent attack speed, combination of single shots and rapid fire, even the possibility of beam form—it had all the conditions needed for offensive magic.

But this was only to say it was highly efficient for its cost. Fundamentally, Photon Cannon was expensive magic. If he continued casting indiscriminately like this, terrible consequences might occur.

'I can't go any further! I'll die first!'

Shirone stopped casting Photon Cannon. The bombardment time was only about three seconds, but dust rose from all directions, making it impossible to see even an inch ahead.

When wind swept through and cleared away the dust, the children shuddered at the scene unfolding before their eyes. The entire area swept by Photon Cannon was devastated.

Orcs were buried in the ground as if crushed, and those who had fled were trembling in fear without the mental capacity to mourn their fallen comrades.

Shirone realized the power of Photon Cannon. Where the flashes had passed, truly nothing remained.

If even the caster was this amazed, what must it have been like for those on the receiving end? The Orc chieftain could only accept reality with a terrified expression.

That mage was unbeatable.

"Grrr, we... go. Let us... pass..."

Currently, Shirone was exhausted to the point where no magic was possible. But he endured, keeping strength in his legs until the end.

"Never come to this place again. If you enter this mountain even once more, it won't end with just this."

The Orc chieftain conveyed his servile emotions in clumsy human language.

"Won't... come. Strong... mage."

"Go."

When Shirone waved his hand, the Orc chieftain was the first to leave. The other Orcs also followed their chieftain into the forest without lingering.

Only after the Orcs disappeared did the tension leave Shirone, and he staggered before closing his eyes and collapsing.

"Shirone! Shirone!"

"Shh! Be quiet. They might come back."

When Altor warned them, the children covered their mouths.

Altor examined Shirone again. He let out a bitter laugh at the sight of him sleeping soundly, oblivious to the world.

While the children of Slash-and-burn Village had matured with the passage of time, Shirone alone seemed to remain as he was in his younger days.

'They say mages don't age.'

At first, he had thought of him as just another common mountain man's child. Moreover, a picked-up child. Shirone didn't resemble Uncle Vincent at all, and maybe that's why he had looked down on him even more.

But it was a mistake. Perhaps Shirone was like the ugly duckling from fairy tales?

A human different by birth from mountain folk.

Altor picked up Shirone. Though Shirone was light as a feather compared to his strength, he felt no pride.

He now knew that the weight of intelligence contained in that light body was something he could never lift.

"Let's go down. The hunting game is over."

* * *

"Huh!"

Shirone, awakening from sleep, bolted upright.

It was someone's house.

Placing his hand on the sofa's backrest and looking around, he saw a cozy wooden floor.

Warmth could be felt from the fireplace burning with a bonfire, and sounds of cooking came from the L-shaped kitchen.

"Oh? Shirone's awake. Lumina, Shirone's up!"

When Martin shouted, loud clattering sounds came from the kitchen. Shortly after, Lumina peeked her flushed face around the wall.

"Where is this?"

Shirone finally remembered. It was Lumina's house, where he had often stayed with his father when he was young.

Children came rushing down from upstairs. Rather than going home, they had stayed by Shirone's side, still in their hunting clothes.

"Shirone, are you okay?"

Altor asked worriedly. As soon as they arrived at the house, he had examined Shirone's body, but there were no particular abnormalities. However, being ignorant about magic, strange symptoms might still appear.

Shirone conducted several tests to check if anything was wrong with his head. His memory was intact, and his mind seemed fine too.

"I'm okay. I guess I collapsed from exhaustion."

"Phew, thank goodness. We thought something had happened to you."

Shirone felt quite sorry for causing unnecessary worry. Of course, the children's thoughts were the complete opposite.

"It feels refreshing to have slept well after so long. I finally feel like the fatigue is lifting."

Though he had taken a long sleep at the lodging, his fatigue hadn't really been relieved. But now he truly felt good. This was because the detestable supersensory perception had disappeared.

He had been confident he would overcome it. But now that what had been there was gone, he could realize just how difficult a state he had been enduring.

'Mr. Armin was right. As soon as I mastered Photon Cannon, the sensation returned. I didn't have nightmares either.'

His stomach rumbled. It was hunger he hadn't felt in a long time. The savory smell flowing from the kitchen also contributed to stimulating his appetite.

Shirone licked his lips and asked Lumina.

"By the way, what are you making?"

"Pork stew. Mom bought meat."

Lumina's mother came out of the kitchen holding a ladle.

"Shirone, hello? It's been a while."

"Hello, ma'am. I'm sorry for the trouble because of me."

"Hehe, I'd be hurt if you said such things. You don't know how much our daughter has been waiting for you."

Lumina's face turned bright red. But suddenly her eyes became sad and she hung her head low.

Altor understood her feelings. He felt the same way, and all the children must be realizing it too.

Shirone couldn't be their leader. He wasn't a child of Slash-and-burn Village, nor was he a mountain man's son.

Shirone was a mage.

As the atmosphere grew heavy, Altor shouted in a hearty voice.

"Come on, come on! I'm hungry. Let's eat first."

"Waaah! We're having meat for the first time in ages! Meat! Meat! Meat! Meat!"

Lumina's mother placed a large pot on the dining table. Stew made with pork was sloshing beyond the proper level.

Though Lumina's family consisted of only four people, since it was common in Slash-and-burn Village for everyone to gather and eat at one house, there were enough dishes.
