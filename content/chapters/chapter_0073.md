When about ten children sat down at the dining table, Lumina's mother generously served them boiled meat.

Shirone felt self-conscious. Preparing this much food would have cost quite a bit of money. Paying for it wouldn't be a problem, but that would create its own awkwardness.

As if reading Shirone's mind, Altor spoke up.

"Don't worry. We can make money by selling the monster's hide. We're planning to start working on it tomorrow. Of course, we'll need your permission first."

"Huh? No, of course you should. Oh, and the monster's name is Ulk. I heard the claws and fangs can fetch quite a good price."

Shirone would naturally give permission, he thought. Moreover, since other parts could also bring money, it was a greater income than expected.

But what was most welcome was learning the monster's name.

In this world, knowledge also meant money.

If they had taken it to market without even knowing its name, they would have been taken advantage of. They might have suffered losses far greater than the effort put into tanning.

"I see. Anyway, thank you. Not just for the Ulk, but if it weren't for you, our village would have had no choice but to move elsewhere."

For those who had cultivated fields and lived by selling mountain products for generations, losing their homeland would have been terrible. In that sense, Shirone was a hero who had saved the village.

"It's fine. This place is precious to me too."

Shirone truly meant it. Even though the Ulk's meat would rot and become unsellable over time, the children had stayed instead of going up the mountain.

They weren't wealthy. That made life difficult, and they had more reasons to blush with shame than nobles, but he liked these people who knew how to live together.

Martin spoke while chewing his meat.

"I'm sorry your hard-earned vacation turned out like this. How about coming up the mountain with us tomorrow instead? We'll sell all the hide and claws and have fun with that money."

The Slash-and-burn Village children never passed up a chance to play, but Shirone shook his head regretfully. Right now, he wanted to return as quickly as possible to analyze the insights he had gained.

"No. I've rested enough. Thanks to you, my fatigue is gone too. Now I need to study hard. I should return to school tomorrow morning."

* * *

After dinner, the children returned to their respective homes. Though it was a moonlit night, they still had work to do. They had to maintain their equipment all night and inspect their carts.

Shirone climbed the hill and looked down at Slash-and-burn Village. The children were moving from house to house with torches, preparing for tomorrow's work. Watching them joke around and chat happily brought a gentle smile to his lips.

"Shirone, so you were here."

"Huh? Altor, how did you find me?"

"I just thought you'd be here. What are you thinking about? You didn't even notice me coming."

"About the past. When I came here with Father, we played so much. We even played tag in those fields over there."

"That's right. But you spent much more time reading books alone. Because of us, of course."

"No. That's because I really loved books..."

Altor burst into a good-natured laugh.

"You don't need to do that. It wouldn't make sense if we didn't know. The children have always admired you. That's why I was jealous many times too. Thinking back now, there are more than a few things I'm sorry about."

"No, I was the strange one. Maybe I was afraid of meeting people. It was a confusing time."

In Slash-and-burn Village, Shirone was his parents' pride, unlike other children who never caused trouble. But in reality, ever since encountering magic at twelve, it had been an endless series of anguish and worries.

Altor nodded as if he had some understanding. After seeing Shirone's magic today, he could realize it.

The boy he thought only knew books and nothing of the world had actually been fighting more fiercely than anyone.

"I'm sorry, Shirone."

"I told you it's fine."

"No, not that. About the drinking session. I spoke out of turn. Everyone has their own capacity. I made a mistake. Don't take it to heart."

Shirone recalled Altor's sharp criticism from last night. He wasn't hurt by it. That too was a burden he had to carry for choosing magic.

"I don't think that way. Actually, I'd never thought about it before. How blessed I am living. How lucky I am."

"No, Shirone. You worked hard. That's why others help you."

"But facts are facts. What you said is my reality, and that's what I have to embrace for life."

Altor smiled bitterly. There was no one in Slash-and-burn Village who could criticize themselves like a stranger would.

"Amazing, being a magician."

He couldn't understand magicians' way of thinking at all. But that's probably why people revered them.

Shirone and Altor looked down at Slash-and-burn Village. Though neither said anything, their gazes were directed at the same place.

* * *

The next morning.

The adults started their daily routine before dawn, leaving only the children.

Shirone had breakfast at Lumina's house and left.

The children saw him off, but they too were loaded with tools for dismantling the Ulk.

In their lives where there was no day of rest, Shirone realized anew how weighty the path he was walking was.

"Take care, Shirone. Study hard. Make sure you become a magician."

Altor offered a handshake. The other children also crowded around Shirone to say goodbye.

"Shirone, you'll come play again, right?"

"Next time you come, tell us lots of stories about magic school."

"Haha! Alright. I'll come when the semester ends. You all take care too."

After saying goodbye to the children, Shirone looked back at Lumina. Even in the cheerful atmosphere, only her face was dark.

Shirone also vaguely guessed Lumina's feelings. But what could he do? Matters between men and women weren't something you could solve by thinking about it.

"Lumina, thanks to you I ate lots of delicious food. You'll make it again, right?"

Only then did Lumina show a smile. It was a smile of resignation. She knew that wanting more would be greedy.

"Of course! So come often. If you act like you don't know us after becoming a magician, I'll beat you up."

"Okay. I'll definitely come back."

Going down the hill from Slash-and-burn Village, Shirone suddenly looked back. And he shouted to the children who were still standing there.

"Everyone take care! Stay healthy!"

When Shirone turned around again and moved away, only then did Lumina drop her head weakly. What was sadder than Shirone leaving was the reality that she could no longer even like him.

"Hey, are you okay?"

Altor asked, placing his hand on Lumina's shoulder. Lumina couldn't hold back and burst into tears. Altor felt inexplicably upset. Though he had guessed her feelings for Shirone since childhood, he didn't know they were this serious.

"Tch, if you're that disappointed, you should have said something. Want me to beat him up and drag him back?"

"No, it's fine. Shirone hasn't left us."

Lumina wiped her tears with both hands alternately and raised her head. Already, a bright smile had appeared on her lips.

"Shirone is going toward his dream."

Lumina prayed to the god of mountains and forests.

May warm light dwell on the path he walks.

* * *

On his way back to school, Shirone thought about the question Slash-and-burn Village had posed.

Just how far could he achieve?

Becoming a guest of the Ozent family and studying with magic school students didn't mean he had accomplished anything.

The advice to learn from failures and steadily persevere didn't apply to him as a commoner.

He had to unleash his talent without rest. He had to develop without hesitating for a moment.

He attended school with the Ozent family's support and studied the advanced subject of magic through his parents' sacrifice.

Was this truly the right path?

If by any chance he failed, could he accept it gracefully and live in the world as before?

Arriving at school, Shirone turned his steps toward the research society. His mind was too unsettled to go to his dormitory.

'Are the kids having fun? I hope they didn't lose too much...'

By now, Iruki and Nade would be excitedly betting in the casino, that other world. He hoped they weren't wagering house deeds at least.

Passing through the Estas maze to the warehouse where the research society was located, Shirone stopped in front of the iron door. Human voices were leaking through the door crack.

"Huh?"

Opening the door, he found Iruki and Nade sitting on the sofa having an argument. The discussion was so heated that Iruki was more excited than ever before.

"You idiot! A perpetual motion machine is absolutely impossible!"

"Why are you so narrow-minded? What I'm talking about isn't infinite motion but a second-type perpetual machine!"

"That violates the law of entropy!"

"Then what's this! What is this thing I made!"

Nade pointed to a clockwork cart on the table. Actually, it was more like a wheeled iron box than something you could call a cart.

"Uh? Over there..."

Nade looked back at Shirone. Then, cutting to the chase, he picked up the clockwork cart and waved it in front of his eyes.

"Shirone! You look and tell us. I made this thing. First, I wind the clockwork like this, then put it on the floor...!"

The cart moved in circular motion. Yet the wound clockwork wasn't unwinding.

Iruki raised his axe-eyes and pointed accusingly.

"Hey, Shirone! Don't be fooled. That's completely fake!"

"What's fake? You've been waiting to see when it stops too, and that's why you're arguing with me now!"

"Idiot! If it could be proven in just 1-2 hours, anyone could have made it! The machine you made just has high efficiency! When I tried turning the clockwork, it was damn stiff!"

"So what? It's a miniature so there are limitations, but if I make it big, I can improve the performance 100 times!"

"How big are you going to make it? Sky-high? It would be much more efficient to feed a horse and have it pull!"

"I just need to show the possibility! Technology naturally moves toward miniaturization over time!"

"Technology without theoretical backing eventually collapses!"

"What do I care about theory! Make it and use it, that's the end!"

Both the mathematician and engineer had valid points. Shirone blinked and listened, then examined the cart.

Watching them get heated over a completely useless cart, he suddenly felt his earlier worries fly away.

'Ah... I see.'

Someday that clockwork cart too would be born with a proper name through countless scholars' research. And someone would again create new knowledge through it.

How arrogant was the thought that only he could accomplish something. He hadn't come this far because he was outstanding.

If Father hadn't bought him books, if he hadn't entered the Ozent family, if there hadn't been the teleportation test, if he hadn't met Iruki and Nade...

The current Shirone wouldn't exist.

A series of coincidences occurring with very small probability. All those events had led Shirone to this place.

'Thank you. For letting me be here.'

After being briefly immersed in his private emotion, Shirone quickly regained his smile and asked his friends.

"By the way, how did the casino go?"

Nade, who had been forehead-to-forehead with Iruki, turned his head with an aggrieved expression.

"How do you think it went? We lost everything in one day and came back. If only the last bet had worked, we could have hit the jackpot."

"That's why I said it would be spades. With 57 percent probability."

"Ridiculous! I lost huge money listening to you! 57 percent my ass! How is that different from pure luck?"
