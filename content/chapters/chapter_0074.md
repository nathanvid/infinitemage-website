"You should have kept pushing forward! Don't you know that the margin of error decreases as the number of attempts increases?"

"That's only if you have bullets left! If we had followed your strategy, we would have had to put up the house deed as collateral!"

"See! See! That's exactly it! There's nothing in this world that can be consumed infinitely! Energy is the same way!"

"Why are you suddenly bringing that up!"

"Ahahaha!"

Shirone burst into laughter. Everyone who challenges their dreams is united as one. That's why success and failure are merely secondary matters.

Even if people in the world point fingers and call it a pointless endeavor, even if they mock him as an idealist who can't even support a single family member, in the end, humanity has been able to develop this far because someone was doing exactly that.

'It doesn't have to be me. I... I don't mind becoming fertilizer for someone else.'

Shirone no longer worried. He would be grateful for all the fortune that had shaped him and continue moving toward his dreams.

Iruki asked with a puzzled expression.

"Shirone, why have you been grinning like that since earlier? Did you eat something strange?"

Shirone shook his head without answering. He renewed his resolve and continued walking.

"I'm back, guys."

* * *

There were two days left until his suspension was lifted.

Nade and Iruki had arrived at Training Ground Four at the crack of dawn and were waiting for Shirone.

Though it was early, the surroundings were bright since it was summer, and the two kept yawning while looking toward the entrance.

Nade rubbed his sleepy face and said, "Ah, what is this? Calling us out this early in the morning."

"Didn't he say he had something to show us?"

"What's he suddenly going to show us? What he's shown us so far is already mind-blowing enough."

"Who knows. Maybe he got a tattoo on his pepper."

"Puahahaha!"

Nade burst into laughter imagining Iruki's words. Meanwhile, Shirone entered the training ground.

"Oh, you're already here. But why is Nade acting like that?"

"Don't know. Probably because he's a pervert."

"Puahahaha! A tattoo! A tattoo there...! Puahahaha!"

Feeling uneasy, Shirone didn't ask further. It was probably just them exchanging silly jokes again.

"Anyway, let's start. I want to show you quickly."

"Show us what? A tattoo? Puahahaha!"

Iruki spoke as if he found it pathetic.

"Stop it. It's not funny anymore. Anyway, why did you call us here? What is it you want to show us?"

"Wait and see. I'll try it right away."

Shirone walked to the center of the training ground and extended his hand toward the rocky mountain.

"What? Photon output? Did you increase the output?"

Shirone cast Photon Cannon. A white flash quickly streaked past Nade and Iruki's eyes.

Bang!

With a dull roar, the rock exploded.

The eyes of Nade and Iruki, who had been indifferent just moments before, widened in shock. Their jaws dropped as if they might fall off.

The spot where the light had struck was deeply indented in a flat shape. Without missing a beat, both rushed over to examine the traces.

"What, what is this? Magic tricks? Or real magic?"

"Strange. To put impact into light. I thought fusion was impossible with photon-type magic. Shirone, what happened?"

Shirone spoke with a triumphant expression.

"This is the new weapon I mastered. It's not photon output, but Photon Cannon."

"Photon Cannon. The name sounds plausible. What's the principle?"

"Well... it's a bit long to explain."

As Shirone hesitated to elaborate, Nade rushed over. With his sleepiness completely gone, he shook Shirone's shoulders.

"Tell us quickly! How did you do it? Light containing physical forceâ€”this should be absolutely impossible!"

Since light and electricity were closely related, Nade clearly understood what Shirone had accomplished.

"I'll tell you. So... would you like to go somewhere with me?"

* * *

Shirone's group entered a restaurant in the noble district. While satisfying their hunger with seafood pasta, Shirone told them about how he came to master Photon Cannon.

The dust whirlpool that occurred on his bed, the situation where he threw Ulk off the cliff, and the principle of Photon Cannon he realized in that moment.

Since Photon Cannon was Shirone's unique concept, he could easily explain it without necessarily bringing up Armin.

Nade and Iruki listened intently, not knowing whether the pasta was going into their mouths or noses.

After an hour-long explanation, Iruki, who had been lost in thought, put down his fork and spoke.

"I've heard about gauge symmetry from my father. The gist is this: there are separate particles that transmit mass, right? And you've become able to manipulate those particles."

Shirone realized anew how remarkable Iruki's father was. To teach his son about gauge symmetry, no less. As befitting the head of the Thunder Dragons, he seemed to grasp all the cutting-edge theories being established throughout magical society.

Nade said, "In other words, mass is the result of Immortal Function. You mastered Photon Cannon, so your supersensory perception disappeared too."

"Yes. And I don't have nightmares anymore either."

Iruki and Nade fell into thought. Particles that transmit mass to matter. Shirone's realization was a tremendous discovery.

Particularly, Photon Cannon was unique magic that only Shirone could perform. No one else could achieve omnipotence. Unless one had personally felt it in the realm of infinity, it wasn't something that could be cast simply by mastering omniscience.

"Amazing, Shirone. This might be an even greater achievement than we imagine. If you filed a patent, you could sit on a pile of money right away with this discovery!"

Nade's mind was already filled with countless inventions that could be created using Shirone's theory.

"So there's something I'd like to ask. Would you come to the library with me?"

"Huh? The library?"

"I'm banned from the school library while under disciplinary action. So I want to try the noble library. I want to research Photon Cannon a bit more. But I can't get in alone, so I was hoping you could take me."

"That's fine with us. It would be helpful for us too. But why can't you get in alone?"

Commoners couldn't enter the noble library. Once his suspension was lifted, he could use the school library, but after visiting Slash-and-burn Village, he had come to a realization. Denying one's identity doesn't change anything. At least to his friends, he wanted to speak honestly.

"Actually, I'm not a noble."

Nade, who had been chewing pasta, opened his mouth blankly. Iruki also seemed shocked and stared at Shirone intently.

"I'm a commoner. I was abandoned in a stable when I was young, and my current parents raised me. My father is an ordinary woodcutter."

Though he had jumped into the world of magic late, who would have thought he was actually a commoner? Especially the fact that he had been abandoned by his birth parents didn't match Shirone's carefree appearance at all.

"I'm sorry. For not telling you until now. I'll accept whatever criticism you have. But I didn't want to keep deceiving you anymore."

Nade and Iruki looked at each other. The emotions they felt through their gazes were the same.

Iruki looked back at Shirone and spoke first.

"It's shocking news. But honestly, I don't feel any different? You're still Shirone, after all."

"Same here. If I had known from the beginning, it might be different, but hearing it now doesn't change anything. The time we've spent together doesn't disappear."

Though he had thought his friends would understand, it was merely personal expectation. When they actually accepted him, Shirone's heart swelled with emotion.

Iruki lowered his head and chuckled.

"So that's why you were in the special admission program. You learned magic late because you weren't a noble. Well, talent isn't something you're born with based on social status. Really amazing."

"Thank you. For saying that."

Seeing Shirone's moved expression, Nade waved his hand dismissively.

"Hey, hey. Don't be so serious about it. I actually think it's fortunate. That I became friends with you without prejudice. If I had known beforehand, I wouldn't have even dreamed of something like the research presentation we did a few days ago."

Iruki stopped thinking and stood up from the table. Dragging this out any longer would only dampen the mood.

"Alright, let's go to the library. I was dying of boredom anyway, so this worked out well. Let's really ignite our academic passion!"

Shirone and Nade followed suit and shouted, "Sounds great!"

**The Great Magician's Return (1)**

Bashka, the capital of the Kingdom of Tormia.

In the Underground Mountain Range that flows in a formation surrounding the royal castle, there was a dungeon 70 meters deep underground that was completed 100 years ago. This place, called the Labyrinth of Darkness, was once the hideout of the great magician Viktor Arcane, who had dominated the world.

Arcane, an authority on dark magic, had engaged in conflicts with various nations before mysteriously disappearing 40 years ago due to some incident.

At that time, Arcane's magician grade was unofficial 3rd class.

Once one reaches 3rd class or higher, they are given the title of Great Magician, regardless of whether it's official or unofficial.

A magician's class is determined by achievements and reputation, which the Magic Association manages through a special scoring system.

The points needed to rise from 10th to 9th class are 1,000 points combining achievements and reputation. And the points needed to rise from 4th to 3rd class are a whopping 280 million points.

In other words, 3rd class magicians were those who had accumulated achievements and reputation beyond what ordinary people could imagine.

When you consider that the achievement points for subjugating an A-level dangerous magic den are 500 points, and the reputation points for being invited to the royal castle and having an audience with the king are 100 points, you can guess how much Arcane had stirred up the world.

Arcane reached the position of unofficial 3rd class magician 40 years ago at the age of 89. Looking at his points at the time, achievements accounted for 100 million points and reputation for 180 million points.

The reason his reputation was higher than his achievements was that he was a troublemaker who had turned the continent upside down.

He was the headache of his era, conducting forbidden experiments as a matter of course and forming dark organizations to produce anarchists, causing incidents that shook the very foundations of nations.

Even now, elderly people over seventy would shudder just hearing Arcane's name, so one could understand how notorious he was without even mentioning the 280 million points.

"Puu. Puu."

Inside a crystal tube filled with green liquid, Arcane opened his eyes. He was completely naked, and his skin sagged as befitted his 149-year-old body.

'Finally... finally it's complete, the Essence of Darkness.'

It was the power of darkness he had collected for a full 40 years. Arcane planned to absorb this to recreate his past glory.

The reason humans die when they age is that cells reach their limit of self-replication. However, Arcane had been suppressing cellular division through life-support devices.

Arcane rolled his eyes and looked at the crystal on the desk. What had initially shone like a diamond was now pitch black. This was thanks to accumulating dark power in the crystal once a day through injection magic.

'Alpheas, wait for me! I will definitely repay this humiliation.'

After suffering a fatal wound from Alpheas in his early twenties, Arcane's magical power had rapidly declined.

But surviving with a single-minded desire for revenge, he would finally regain his former power today and be reborn once again as a great magician.

As the green liquid from the life-support device drained through the drain, Arcane's back bent along with the falling water level. It was a decrepit body that could have been placed in a coffin at any moment.

The front of the crystal sphere opened as if cut away, and Arcane crawled out, breathing heavily.

"Canis! Arin! Are you there?"

A young-looking boy and girl entered through the door. Perhaps because they had learned dark magic, they had a somewhat gloomy atmosphere.

"Did you call for us, Master?"

"Clothes. Bring me my clothes."
