Canis brought over a light green robe. Though Arin was watching, Arcane changed clothes without hesitation.

Supporting himself against the table as he walked, Arcane could finally catch his breath once he sat down in the chair.

"Phew, now I feel like I can live again."

"Are you alright, Master?"

Canis asked worriedly. The dark circles that contrasted with his pale skin revealed him to be a dark magician without needing to be told.

*Beautiful eyes. That's why I took him as a disciple.*

On the other hand, Arcane didn't particularly favor Arin. Judging by the mutation that had turned her hair and eyes black, she certainly had talent, but her heart was soft and her judgment was poor.

Her pretty face showed not a trace of malice, and her large eyes displayed her emotions plainly.

Arcane clicked his tongue at the sight of her pupils trembling from the moment she had seen the old man's naked body.

*Tsk tsk, what use is such a thing? Completely useless.*

If she hadn't been Canis's close friend, he would never have brought such a weak girl along.

It was that day seven years ago.

Even with life support devices, his mobility had become inconvenient, so he squeezed out his last strength and entered the capital Bashka.

Befitting the largest city of the Kingdom of Tormia, the streets were wealthy and splendid. But behind the light, the wretched lives of those abandoned by the city continued.

The slums of Radum.

True to a capital with extreme polarization, the residents of Radum lived far more miserable lives than beggars in other cities.

In this place where people wouldn't even come near, the only means of obtaining food was rummaging through garbage bins. Even that was so competitive that murders over fish bones were commonplace.

Arcane had found Canis and Arin there.

In Radum where daily life was war, the way ten-year-old Canis had survived with Arin was by becoming cruel.

Canis's eyes burned with hostility toward the world.

Arcane liked that look in his eyes. And he brought the two to the dungeon and taught them dark magic.

*My eye wasn't wrong. That one is definitely something special.*

Arcane refused Canis's support and stood up. It was the day he would escape from his detestable aging, so he didn't want to show weakness today.

"Watch carefully, the greatness of dark magic."

Arcane gripped the black crystal and closed his eyes. Though his hands trembled weakly from lack of strength, his face held unmistakable excitement.

"Kuah!"

As he put his energy into it, the crystal became soft and wrapped around Arcane like a stream of water. Then it scattered like storm clouds and covered his entire body.

"Kuaaaaah!"

Arcane let out a monstrous scream. Absorbing forty years' worth of accumulated power all at once would have driven an ordinary person insane.

The concept of dark magic is absorption and assimilation.

Arcane regained his former power by assimilating the dark force absorbed in the crystal with his own darkness.

"Uooooo!"

The shadow cast beneath Arcane's feet flickered like flames, then separated from the main body and scattered like fragments.

How much time had passed?

Canis and Arin slowly opened their eyes. Arcane's appearance showed not a trace of the decrepitude from before.

His appearance hadn't particularly grown younger or his back straightened. But his complexion had a healthy flush and his eyes were full of vitality.

Sensing an unapproachable aura from his master who had regained his health, Canis trembled with emotion.

*Is this Master's true form? I'd heard rumors, but he's truly amazing.*

Arcane smiled with satisfaction. It was his powerful appearance from before he had been defeated by Alpheas.

"Let's go. From today, Arcane's history will be written anew."

Having waited forty years for this day, Arcane left the dungeon without even time to savor the lingering effects of the surging power.

* * *

The place Arcane arrived at was Bashka's western prison 'Inferno'. As a place that housed mid-level criminals from D-class to B-class, it boasted ironclad security.

"Halt! Who goes there! This is a restricted area!"

The guards didn't treat them lightly even though the approaching figures were an old man and children. They first drew their weapons and shouted while on guard.

"Identify yourselves! If you don't comply, we will arrest you!"

"Green young fools..."

The shadow beneath Arcane's feet stretched out and merged with the guards' shadows. Without understanding what had happened, the guards rolled back their eyes and their eyelids fluttered. Then they fell to their knees and collapsed on the ground.

"Hmph, not even worth a snack. Canis, open the door."

Canis took a bundle of keys from the guard's waist and opened Inferno's main gate. Though his master could crumple iron doors if he wanted, he didn't seem inclined to make a big scene.

But Canis's expectation was immediately wrong. From the moment they breached the main gate, Arcane began showing his true colors.

"Intruder! Attack! Permission to kill granted!"

"Contact the royal castle for reinforcements! It's a magician!"

The guards came charging with their weapons drawn. But numbers didn't matter to a dark magician. Arcane's shadow stretched out like tentacles and merged with the soldiers' shadows.

"Krgh! What is this?"

"My body won't move!"

The guards couldn't move their bodies. Then when Arcane waved his hand, they turned toward their comrades and began thrusting their spears regardless of their will.

"Ahhh! Are you crazy? That's dangerous!"

"I don't know either! I'm not doing this!"

Arin's face turned pale. Born with eyes completely different from others, she was receiving the guards' terror without any filter.

"Canis, you never said Master would come to a place like this."

Canis was equally puzzled. But his trust in Arcane didn't waver in the slightest.

"He must have some plan. Let's go for now."

Arcane leisurely broke through the battlefield and headed for the building. When the shadows connected to the guards snapped, those who had been fighting collapsed foaming at the mouth.

This was mental domination, a characteristic of dark magic.

Darkness achieves unity with other darkness. Using this property, one infiltrates another's shadow to control their body and thoughts.

Looking only at the advantages, dark magic's characteristics were overpowered.

Yet the reason it was relegated to a minor school was that one disadvantage covered all the advantages.

That weakness to light.

With the sun up, darkness could only exist as a span of shadow. Moreover, the stronger the light, the more mental power had to be consumed to cast dark magic.

Of course, a dark magician's capabilities were maximized at night, but even that was losing ground as Kergos's photonization theory became popularized.

Throughout the continent's magic schools, there were hardly any students majoring in dark magic, showing how much dark magic was looked down upon in magical society.

But Canis knew that Arcane had perfectly overcome dark magic's weakness. And the strongest essence he had realized had been passed entirely to him.

*Yes, I must trust Master. The one who gave me everything.*

Arcane broke through the entrance and entered the prison, dealing with additional guards in the corridor. Then he opened the iron door to A-3 wing where prisoners were held and entered. Prisoners who had sensed something had happened were banging their food bowls against the bars.

"Hey! I don't know who you are, but get us out!"

"Look! Open this damn iron door! I'll pay you well! Or I could kill someone for you instead!"

Arcane slowly extended both hands. The prison's gloomy environment was the perfect place for Arcane to show off his specialty.

"Authority of Darkness."

The shadows cast in the corridor took the form of hands and emerged three-dimensionally. Hundreds of hands grasped the bars and pulled, creating the sound of twisting metal. The moment the frightened prisoners backed against the walls, the bars were torn away in sequence along the corridor.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

Authority of Darkness was magic that controlled shadows that had absorbed surrounding energy like limbs. While a single strand of shadow could barely lift a pebble, when hundreds of pairs of hands moved mechanically, they displayed monstrous strength that could easily pull out even iron bars.

After the iron doors opened and some time passed, prisoners began to appear awkwardly. Heavy iron balls were attached to their ankles.

"What, are you a magician? How remarkable."

"Anyway, thanks. Let's introduce ourselves. I'm Nightcat Crown. Just mentioning my name gets recognition in these parts."

Arcane made a displeased expression at sensing the prisoners' pathetic energy. Forty years ago, Inferno wasn't like this. How had this place once full of vicious criminals fallen so far?

*Time is truly fleeting. Does this mean life has gotten better?*

According to Arcane's theory, as civilization advances, the quality of criminals declines. Clever swindlers increase, while truly bad people infiltrate society.

"Pathetic things. A criminal introducing himself? Do you think you can leave here just because the bars are gone?"

"What, has this old fool gone senile? I was trying to be nice, but do you know who I am?"

The prisoners acted tough, believing in their numerical advantage. There was no guarantee they were on the same side just because they'd shared prison life.

"Listen well, you fools. If you're not confident you can defeat me, just stay locked up in prison. Those who disobey my command will suffer the pain of broken bones."

The prisoners burst into laughter.

"Bwahahaha! What is this old man babbling about? Do you think we'll just go back after coming this far?"

"Let's trample him! I need to get out of this damn prison!"

Excited by regaining their freedom, the prisoners rushed forward recklessly. But they soon realized they still had shackles on their ankles.

Had their reason been temporarily paralyzed? Perhaps they hadn't been conscious of it after wearing them for years.

"Huh? Huh? Damn it!"

Only then did the prisoners begin to panic. Arcane watched their pathetic state and snorted.

If one chooses evil, one should have skill, and if lacking skill, at least be clever. But these were just parasites eating prison food.

"Authority of Darkness."

"Ugh, ahhh! What is this!"

The hands that had torn the bars now wrapped around the prisoners and dragged them into the darkness. Their eyes, noses, and mouths disappeared behind a black veil as if buried in giant gel.

Shortly after, the sound of breaking bones was heard.

"Mmmph! Mmph!"

"Grrrgh!"

With their mouths blocked, the prisoners couldn't even scream.

Hearing the ominous crunching sounds, Arin shuddered and said to Canis.

"Canis, does revenge really require doing such things?"

"Arin, denying Master means denying ourselves."

"Even so..."

"Have you forgotten what happened in Radum? There were many more terrible things than this. Besides, the prisoners here are the same kind that tormented us in Radum."

"But you promised. To forget everything that happened in Radum. To be happy from now on."

"Nothing is finished yet. Until Master's resentment is resolved, happiness won't come to us either."

When the darkness filling the corridor disappeared, the prisoners with broken bones lay sprawled in grotesque positions, writhing.

Looking down at them with arrogant eyes, Arcane muttered.

"Weak things. Was this a wasted trip? Or will it get better if I go to other rooms?"

The number of criminals imprisoned in Inferno was 320. Perhaps only this particular place was filled with such low-grade scum.
