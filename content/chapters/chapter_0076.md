Clank. Clank.

While he was having such thoughts, the sound of chains echoed from the prison at the end of the corridor. When a wolf-like man revealed himself, Arcane's eyes lit up with interest.

This one was completely different from those fools who had rushed out recklessly the moment a single cell opened. Moreover, he was pleased to see that the man wore shackles in addition to handcuffs.

"There's still one more left. Did you hide your presence? Your Schema is quite impressive."

The man examined the sorry state of the fallen prisoners and burst into hollow laughter.

"Heh heh heh, this is absurd. Do you know where this is? This is Inferno, the western prison. Are you planning a rebellion?"

"A rebellion. How delightful. Will you join me?"

The man shrugged his shoulders.

"If you let me out, I might consider it."

"Your ears should have been open even if you couldn't see, right? There's no freedom unless you can defeat me."

"Hah, how rigid."

The man raised his arms, restrained by handcuffs, and scratched his head. The moment his eyes gleamed sharply between his forearms, he launched his body without any warning.

Using Schema's jumping power that surpassed even the weight of iron balls, he swung his foot, and the iron ball struck Arcane's face directly.

"Master!"

Bang!

The man landed with a disgusted expression, bending his knees. To think such a sound would come from hitting a person.

"Tch, what an annoying magic."

Arcane didn't budge an inch. Half of his face that had been struck by the iron ball was covered in pitch-black shadow. It was Dark Skin magic that maximized the absorption power of dark magic to absorb the impact.

"Not bad at all. You pass."

When Arcane cast the power of darkness, shadows rising from the floor grabbed the man's shackles and handcuffs.

"Don't move. Your limbs might fly off."

Before the man could respond, the shadows stood up like blades and rotated rapidly. The iron chains were severed in an instant, yet the man's skin wasn't harmed in the slightest. Unlimited sculptural arts and delicate manipulation were the essence of dark magic.

"How nice to gain freedom. Follow me. There's work for you to do."

"Why are you doing this? I never said I'd join you."

The corners of the smiling man's mouth trembled slightly.

He already knew how strong his opponent was. But if he was dragged along like cattle, wouldn't that make the jailbreak meaningless?

"What motivates you is money, isn't it? If you help me, you'll be able to make big money."

It was common knowledge that magicians were wealthy.

Moreover, the man was someone who would do anything to make money, so there was no reason to refuse.

"Heh heh, big money. If it's a mediocre amount, I'll quit halfway through."

The man followed Arcane out of the prison. Thus, one escapee was generated from Inferno.

Shirone's group organized the materials they had collected from the library into notes and then rented an inn. Thanks to two days of discussion, they were able to grasp the outline of the Photon Cannon's principles.

"Why does mass exist?"

If there were no mass, no changes would occur. And that would have been a decent enough world. What's the big deal if today repeats like yesterday?

But mass existed from the beginning. As if this world had to be filled with all kinds of new things.

"Mass isn't weight. Weight is the force acting in the direction of gravity. There's no direction in space, right? So what is mass then? Cohesive force? But even that doesn't seem like a complete explanation."

Nade asked.

"Then what do you think it is?"

The feeling that came to mind was clear. But while it was clear, it wasn't distinct.

"Existence."

"Huh?"

"Proof of being in this space. That's what mass might be."

Life is a code exclusive to living beings. Perhaps mass is the true certificate of existence that applies throughout the entire universe.

"Hmm. Now that you mention it, that sounds plausible. Like the will or breath of a creator."

Hearing Nade's words, Iruki snapped his fingers.

"God particle."

"Huh? What?"

"God particle, I mean. Isn't that good? We'll call the particle Shirone discovered the God particle."

"Oh ho, that's nice! Shirone, what do you think?"

Shirone nodded repeatedly. It felt as if Iruki hadn't created the term but had excavated something that was already there, fitting perfectly with the omnipotence he was feeling.

"I really like it. And this is important."

"Right. A magician's omnipotence is connected to feeling. It's better to use a name that appeals to your heart."

In that sense, the God particle was an excellent choice.

When the discussion came to a close, Iruki flopped down on the bed. His eyes were about to pop out from poring over books all day.

"Whew, let's finish the analysis here and return to school tomorrow. Classes will start normally the day after tomorrow, so let's prepare ourselves mentally. You haven't forgotten our promise already, have you?"

Nade chimed in.

"Of course not. Moving up to Class Four this semester. From now on, I'm going to study like crazy. In the worst-case scenario, Shirone might graduate first."

That might actually happen.

What started as a joke gradually became serious on Nade and Iruki's faces.

At this rate, Shirone might graduate first. The discovery of the God particle was that significant an achievement.

"Shirone, you wouldn't happen to think about staying another year even if you graduate, would you?"

"Haha! What are you talking about? In the current situation, I'm the one most likely to break our promise. At least you guys are in the upper ranks."

Shirone's words weren't wrong either, but considering just the growth rate, it was enough to feel a sense of crisis. A student who didn't even know the Four-Direction Style was now discussing graduation after just half a year.

"I can't sleep. I'll study a bit before going to bed."

"Huh? Th-then me too!"

When Iruki got up from the bed and opened his books, Nade also quickly took a seat at the corner table and began studying.

Shirone was dumbfounded when his friends, who would normally say "let's play even if the world ends tomorrow," were burning with academic passion. But soon he looked at them with warm eyes.

'I've met good friends.'

Shirone was the last of the three to open his books.

Kingdom Educational Academic Association Teachers' Council.

The Kingdom Academic Conference hosted by the Teachers' Council was a venue where all social and cultural professionals gathered—including magic schools, swordsmanship schools, religious orders of various denominations, academic schools, alchemy foundations, and the Elite Artists' Council of 99—to present the kingdom's vision.

Thad attended the academic conference as a representative of Alpheas Magic School. As discussions about the harmful effects and positive functions of cramming education continued for days, his mind was about to snap.

'Argh, damn it. Do those guys never sleep? Let me go home.'

He had to attend because he drew the short straw, but it was truly awful. Having been a notorious troublemaker since his school days, he believed that voluntary learning or whatever had nothing to do with education.

The only consolation was that there were many decent female teachers. Particularly, the woman sitting at the round table across from him was his perfect ideal type.

With blue hair flowing in waves and mischievous charm that couldn't be hidden even in formal wear, everything about her was attractive.

'She looks so innocent. Was her name Reina of Ozent?'

She was a musician who attended as a disciple of Merhen, the melodic pianist, belonging to the Council of 99, the kingdom's finest artistic group.

The discussion ended at 7 PM.

When the evening party hosted by the Teachers' Council began, the heat of the debate vanished like a lie. Participants busily exchanged ideas with people from various fields while sipping wine.

Particularly around Reina, high-ranking officials gathered—people whose names even those uninterested in the Teachers' Council would have heard.

'So this is what they mean when they say beauty is a burden.'

Thad waited his turn to at least say something to her while eavesdropping on their conversations. Most were either stiffly authoritative remarks or malicious jokes.

Reina responded kindly without losing her warm smile. To Thad, this was an unexpected sight. She had such a bright personality that it didn't match the notorious reputation of the Council of 99.

Art was a technique for handling emotions, and thus its power to captivate the masses was not something even those in power could ignore.

Particularly due to art's critical function, there were quite a few stubborn people among artists.

But Reina seemed completely unrelated to such rumors, enjoying herself with people from all walks of society.

'Sigh, if only Teacher Siena had half that personality.'

While he was having such thoughts and sipping wine, Reina, having finished her conversation, walked toward Thad.

"Hello, Teacher Thad."

"Ah, yes! Huh? But do you know me?"

"Of course. You're a teacher at Alpheas Magic School. The main house of Ozent is in Creas."

"Ah! That's right. I had forgotten. Nice to meet you."

The two talked for a long time, bonding over their shared hometown. As Thad had expected, Reina had a bright and fun personality.

"By the way, how is Shirone doing?"

"Huh? How do you know Shirone? Ah, I see."

Thad, who had been the grading teacher for Shirone's entrance test, remembered that Ozent family was written in the origin section.

"Shirone was a guest of the Ozent family. As expected of a prestigious family, you have an excellent eye for people. Shirone is doing well. Well, he did cause some trouble recently."

"What? Trouble? What kind of trouble?"

When Reina's eyes widened, Thad thought 'oops.' If the Ozent family found out that the student they were backing had been suspended, her pride would be hurt.

"Ahaha! It's nothing serious. Since he's such an outstanding student, even minor things become big rumors. It's that kind of trouble."

"Ah, so that's what it was."

Reina breathed a sigh of relief. Just from Thad's story, she could guess what kind of life Shirone was leading.

"I'm glad to hear he's doing well. Does he have many friends?"

"Of course. He's popular with both boys and girls. Sometimes I'm envious to death. Hahaha!"

"Oh. Then perhaps..."

Reina, who was about to ask if he had a girlfriend, shook her head. It was a perfectly reasonable question for a patron to ask. But the questioner in her heart wasn't just borrowing the patron's name.

"Yes? Is there something you're curious about?"

"No. I'm just relieved that he seems to be doing well."

"Haha! Don't worry. It's embarrassing for me to say this myself, but Alpheas Magic School is prestigious. You can trust us with him."

"Heh heh, that's right. I was overstepping. Sorry."

"Not at all. Rather, I was being presumptuous. How about going to Creas with me? I'm planning to leave in the morning. I'll treat you to a nice lunch."

Reina shook her head with a regretful expression.

"Sorry. I have a performance schedule, so I need to return to Bashka."

"Ah, I see. What a shame..."

Thad couldn't hide his disappointment. Normally he would let her go without any lingering feelings, but she was truly a woman too precious to let slip away.

"It can't be helped. But I really want to see your performance. Would you tell me the schedule? I'll come find you in Bashka."

"Oh my, that would be an honor. Actually, I was worried. Something bad happened in the capital, so I was wondering what to do if there were many empty seats."

"Ah, what happened in Bashka?"

"They say a dark magician attacked Inferno and helped a B-class wanted criminal escape. Right now the capital is in a state of security as strict as martial law."

"A dark... magician?"

Thad's brow furrowed. It might be just one of many news stories, but thinking about it, it was a rare incident.

Dark magicians were hard to find these days. And of all things, attacking Inferno? Just to extract one B-class wanted criminal?

Dark magician, Inferno, B-class wanted criminal.

A scene from history flashed through Thad's mind.
