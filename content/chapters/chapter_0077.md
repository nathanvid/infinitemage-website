"Could you tell me more details about the situation?"

"The incident happened a week ago. The escaped prisoner is a man named Lucas, and before he was caught, he was the vice-leader of the Parrot Bandits. The leader is currently wanted."

"Besides the escapee, don't you know anything about the appearance or clothing of the person who attacked Inferno?"

"Hmm, well. I only heard rumors too. I heard it was an elderly man with white hair. There seemed to be two followers with him. They said he used dark magic to extract the prisoners. What was it called... something about darkness..."

"Power of Darkness?"

"Yes, that's right! You really are a magic school teacher."

Though Reina praised him, Thad didn't hear it. Dark magic. And an elderly man who could cast the advanced technique called Power of Darkness had attacked Inferno.

'Could it be?'

Thad suddenly lifted his head.

"I'm sorry. I need to go first."

"Huh? Oh, yes."

Maintaining courtesy until the end was almost instinctive. In Thad's eyes, neither the party hall nor the beautiful woman were visible anymore.

'Damn it! Of all times, when I'm on a business trip!'

He said the escape was a week ago. If they traveled non-stop from Bashka, they would have had more than enough time to reach Creas.

"Carriage! Carriage!"

Thad left the mansion and climbed into any of the carriages waiting in line. Then he opened the window to the driver's seat and shouted.

"To Creas! As fast as possible!"

"S-sir, all the carriages here are reserved. Those not on the list cannot be..."

Since it was a carriage meant to transport high-ranking officials, it wouldn't be swayed by any ordinary amount of money.

Thad rummaged through his pockets and pulled out all the money he had.

"Here! Take this. Will you go or not?"

After counting the number of gold coins scattered on the box seat, the driver immediately changed his expression and prepared to depart.

"I'll take you swiftly. We're traveling through the night, right?"

"No sleep or rest needed! Just go quickly!"

The cheerful sound of horse hooves beat against the night air.

"Damn! I can't be late."

Thad leaned back against the seat and pressed his forehead. He wanted to leap through spatial teleportation if he could, but attempting it repeatedly in unfamiliar territory without knowing the coordinates or environment would cost him ten lives.

The fact that he could do nothing actually helped him regain his composure. Once he grasped the situation, questions began to arise.

What scheme could he have for reappearing in the world again?

Thad had never met him or seen his face. But the terrible connection Alpheas had told him about remained vivid in his memory.

"Viktor Arcane..."

Thad's eyes blazed as he stared straight ahead.

Past 4 AM, Canis's group entered the training ground located on the mountainside of Alpheas Magic School.

Though he had never attended a magic school, he could tell it was a top-tier facility, befitting a Great Magician's disciple.

A frivolous voice broke the silence.

"Whew, nicely built. Completely wallpapered with gold coins. How much would the land value be?"

Canis frowned and turned his head. B-class wanted criminal Lucas had twin swords engraved with parrots slung over his shoulder.

"Keep your voice down. Guards might be patrolling."

"What's to worry about? Just cut them down. Bury them."

Canis felt even more displeased. Though he was accompanying them according to his master's will, there wasn't a single likeable aspect about this man.

"Aren't you mistaken? You're hired by us. If you disrupt the operation, I won't let you off first."

"Phew, how scary. Kids these days have it good. Meeting great masters and talking back to adults."

Lucas plopped down in the training ground. Since he wasn't disrupting the operation anymore, Canis suppressed his anger.

'The most important thing is Master's revenge. Even if I don't like it, I have to endure.'

Lucas yawned and asked.

"By the way, why are we waiting here? We have to go down to the school anyway."

Arin revealed her feelings of disgust as she spoke.

"Master is going to cast magic. It's area magic, so if we're within range, we won't be safe either. If you're confident, you can go down first."

Lucas shrugged. Honestly, he wanted to avoid Arcane's magic.

"Hehe, don't be so angry, little miss. Your cute face looks ugly when you're mad."

"Hmph, I don't care how others look."

"Don't be like that, want to date this uncle? I can teach you something more fun than magic."

Just as Arin's face reddened and she was about to shout, unable to contain herself, Canis cut off the conversation.

"Quiet. It's starting now."

The gazes of Canis's group turned to the sky. Arcane was floating in the center of the moon, casting Fly magic.

Fly is fusion magic that simultaneously uses Press and Blow, the two branches of the Air series. The principle involves first forming solid air pressure around oneself with Press-type magic, then creating wind with Blow-type magic to generate lift. Though classified as overpowered due to the merit of flight, delicate senses were essential since wind changes in real time.

As darkness gathered and covered the moon, Arcane's eyes suddenly opened as he concentrated. Combining omniscience and omnipotence, he spread his limbs wide and cast his life's masterpiece, Abyss Nova.

There was no roar or terrible aftermath, but the sight of dark energy covering the school was spectacular.

As the effect of Abyss Nova that spread to the outskirts of the magic school disappeared, the moon reappeared and the surroundings brightened.

"Huff. Huff."

Arcane breathed heavily. Even for him as a Great Magician, it was massive magic that required ninety percent of his mental power.

'It'll be hard to bring up for a while.'

Arcane changed direction toward the mountain. Even maintaining Fly magic was difficult, but his anger grew stronger.

Now that Abyss Nova had spread, no one could interfere with him. Moreover, hadn't he raised disciples in preparation for such a situation?

"Hehehe, wait, Alpheas. I'll make you taste the humiliation from forty years ago."

The dark night passed, and pale light was rising from the eastern foothills.

**Unwelcome Guests of Darkness (1)**

It was the last day of suspension. Shirone's group, who had studied at the inn until dawn, didn't wake up until well past morning. After briefly teasing each other about their disheveled appearances, they bathed.

By the time they returned books to the Great Library and entered the school, lunch time had already ended. Since it was class time, the campus was quiet with janitors sweeping the stone paths.

"This is the end of our vacation."

"What vacation? Is suspension a vacation?"

"Still, we had fun. What are you going to do now?"

Shirone turned toward the dormitory and said.

"First, I'm going to organize my room. Since classes start tomorrow, I need to clean today."

"You really are meticulous, I'll give you that. Alright. We'll be at the research society, so come by if you're bored."

"Sure. See you later."

After parting with his friends, Shirone returned to the dormitory. His room was a mess since he couldn't pay attention to it during the presentation preparation period. Rolling up his sleeves and starting to clean, he finished by organizing his textbooks in order on the bookshelf and dusted off his hands.

A week-long suspension that came without warning.

But there was something he had gained from it. No, it was an enlightenment beyond anything he had learned at school so far.

'Finally, regular classes. I wish tomorrow would come quickly.'

It was natural that his progress had fallen behind, and he planned to focus on classes even if it meant reducing research society activities for a while.

'Nade and Iruki must feel the same way.'

His friends' eyes at the inn had been burning with scholarly passion. This was thanks to having a clear goal of advancing to Class Four before this semester ended.

Alpheas Magic School determined promotion candidates at the end of each semester based on first-half grades, with a cutline of no less than 80 points in all subjects. It wasn't an average of 80 points, but a terrifying difficulty requiring 80 points or higher in every single subject.

Of course, it wasn't an impossible score, but it was difficult for any student. There were bound to be weak subjects depending on individual aptitude.

Nevertheless, the school's educational policy was firm.

Before entering a major, one must master knowledge in all fields above a certain level.

Therefore, any magic school graduate should be considered capable of utilizing basic magic from each series. This was also why magic school graduates were favored in the front lines of magical society.

Not all active magicians graduated from magic schools. The proportion of non-magic school graduates who became disciples of magicians, gained enlightenment, or learned magic through dark routes was also significant.

Their advantage was rich field experience and casting magic suitable for actual combat. However, they also had the disadvantage of lacking understanding of magic and having less development potential compared to magic school graduates.

Who to hire depended on the nature of the work, but magic school graduates did have an advantage in employment. Thus, the 80-point standard the school presented was a criterion considering modern social conditions.

"Sigh. So what? In my case, I need to raise my average by more than 30 points."

Whatever enlightenment Shirone had gained, this was still a school. To advance, he absolutely needed omniscience of 80 points or higher.

Using the framework of knowledge, it wasn't impossible. Moreover, supplementing with knowledge gained from preparing for the presentation and studying divine particles would significantly raise his scores.

But even considering such aspects, he thought the probability of advancing was roughly 30 percent.

'No, isn't that actually amazing? Advancing to Class Four in just half a year with a 30 percent chance.'

Shirone thought positively. Wasn't it rather a probability worth challenging? If Nade and Iruki advanced and only he remained in Class Five... the thought alone was terrible.

Moreover, entering Class Four would make it possible to apply for the graduating class. That would mean keeping his promise to Amy.

"Gasp! Right! Amy!"

He hadn't met her even once since the presentation ended. At the time, he was too excited to even think of looking for her.

'Ah, I should have at least greeted her. I was too thoughtless.'

Amy was a grateful friend who had cheered him on during every difficult challenge. This time, he would be a source of strength for her. With such thoughts, mischief appeared in Shirone's eyes as he left the dormitory.

"Hehe! She'll be so surprised!"

* * *

Shirone headed to the graduating class with two cups of coffee in his hands. One was for Amy, the other for Seriel. Remembering the past when he had run errands bringing coffee for Amy, a bitter smile naturally formed on his lips.

'Back then, I really thought the world was ending.'

Looking back, it had been a fateful connection.

Who would have known that the delinquent girl he met in an alley at age twelve would now be his friend?

Shirone climbed the hill to the graduating class. The arch called the Steel Gate stood guard at the entrance. When he had only seen it from afar, he hadn't realized it, but it was a much larger structure than he had thought.

'This is the pinnacle of the magic school.'

Passing under the structure symbolizing a magician's spirit, Shirone's heart somehow became solemn.

When the sixth period class ended, graduating class students came out. Shirone spotted Amy and Seriel conversing at the central entrance and shouted.

"Amy! Amy!"

The graduating class students turned their heads, but Amy and Seriel, perhaps not hearing him, were still absorbed in their conversation. Then, struck by mischief, Shirone quietly went behind them and held out coffee in front of Amy's eyes.

"Ta-da! A surprise gift!"

Amy's eyes widened in surprise. Shirone beamed and also offered coffee to Seriel.

"Here, this is for you too, senior. Drink this and cheer up!"

Seriel tilted her head. Amy also blinked, then frowned and said.

"What? Who are you? Why are you giving us coffee?"
