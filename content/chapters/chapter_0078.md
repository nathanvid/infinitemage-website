Shirone thought Amy was just playfully retorting.

"Sorry. Did I startle you? I didn't say anything because I wanted to surprise you. How are the graduating class lessons?"

Amy showed a wary look in her eyes. Then when Shirone tried to approach closer, she hastily swatted his arm. The two cups of coffee he was holding went flying.

Shirone wore a dazed expression. This couldn't be considered a joke anymore. Amy's face was also flushed red as if she was genuinely angry.

"Who are you to do something like this? And why are you speaking casually to me when you use honorifics with Seriel?"

Seriel also showed an unpleasant expression, thinking this wasn't right.

"Are you from the advanced class? No matter how interested you might be, this kind of approach isn't right, is it? And you should use honorifics with seniors. What is this? You're not even a playboy."

Shirone was flabbergasted. Amy and Seriel were acting as if they didn't know him.

"Seriel-senpai, it's me, Shirone. Don't you recognize me? Amy, do you really not know me? You're joking, right?"

"How would I know you? If you're a student, please study for once. Are you so annoying that you can't even distinguish time and place? Do I look that easy to you?"

Amy grabbed Shirone by the collar. She was genuinely irritated. She thought becoming a graduating class student would mean farewell to bothersome guys, but they followed her even here.

'It was quiet for a while, but now it's starting again. This is all because that guy isn't worth anything. Hanging around with weird kids and doing nonsense...'

Amy, who had been muttering to herself, tilted her head.

'Huh? That guy? Who is that?'

She definitely felt like some person was involved in the reason why the persistent male students had backed off, but she couldn't remember.

Shirone, whose collar was grabbed, felt like his heart had been pierced through. Amy's eyes contained no intimacy whatsoever.

"No... this isn't right."

Shirone shook off Amy's hand that was grabbing his collar.

"No! Don't lie!"

"Ouch."

Amy held her wrist with a pained expression. But Shirone shouted as if even that sight was detestable to him.

"Why are you pretending not to know me! What did I do wrong? If you hate me, just say you hate me! This way makes me feel bad too!"

"You! Get away!"

Seriel pushed Shirone away. Because it was none other than Seriel, Shirone couldn't even resist and fell on his bottom.

"Why are you tormenting my friend? And to a senior at that! What class are you in? Do you really want to get in trouble?"

Shirone looked up at her with the face of someone who had lost everything in the world.

'Seriel-senpai...'

Amy's one and only best friend. A natural-born girl who always ranked high with her excellent skills but would also shed tears while reading romance novels. Shirone remembered. Her figure cheering him on enthusiastically whenever he faced difficult challenges.

But the current her was a completely different person. Her pupils were burning like fire, and hostility was embedded in her tightly pressed lips.

Shirone shook his head. It wasn't that he couldn't believe itâ€”he didn't want to believe it. Such a thing could never happen.

"No! It's a lie!"

Shirone slipped up and ran away. If he stayed here even one more second, he felt like he would go crazy.

"Don't ever come looking for us again! If you mess around like this one more time, I'll tell the teacher!"

Seriel, who had made a megaphone with her hands and shouted, still seemed unable to calm down as she frowned and said to Amy.

"Geez, what kind of kid is that? He looks gentle but he's incredibly persistent. Oh my, Amy. Are you okay?"

"Huh? Oh, I'm fine."

Amy, who had been lost in thought, suddenly snapped back to attention. But the uncomfortable feeling still remained. She felt a strange longing looking at Shirone's retreating figure.

"Who on earth is he? He really acted like he knew me."

"He probably just acted crazy and approached you. There are a lot of kids like that these days. Having the audacity to set his sights on someone."

"Is that so?"

"Anyway, I'm going to head in. Hey, I wanted to talk with you after such a long time, but that weird kid made our break time pass by."

Even though they were in the same graduating class, since their majors were different, it was difficult to find time to check on each other unless they made special effort.

When Seriel entered the classroom, Amy followed behind. But she stopped partway through entering the entrance and looked back toward where Shirone had run.

"..."

Until the class bell rang, she remained standing there.

* * *

'Why are they acting like that! What's the reason!'

Shirone ran like crazy. When he arrived at the advanced class building after passing through the steel door, the class bell rang and students entered their classrooms.

"Mark! Mark!"

Mark, who had been chatting with Maria, turned his head. Shirone ran up to him in one breath and asked.

"Mark! You know me, right? Who am I! Tell me quickly!"

Mark looked back at Maria in confusion. But Maria also shrugged as if she didn't know.

"Um... who are you?"

Shirone's heart began beating like crazy. He had no idea what had happened to him.

"It's me. Me."

"So who are you? You have to tell me for me to know."

"It's me! Shirone! Class Five! We took exams together! You really don't know?"

Mark's face crumpled. But hearing about Class Five, he couldn't argue and politely bowed his head.

"Ah, yes. I'm sorry for not recognizing you."

"That's not it! Why are you treating me like that!"

What did they expect him to do? If it were up to his temperament, he would have snapped back, but he couldn't do that with others watching.

"You guys, class has started but what are you doing out here instead of going in?"

Siena was walking down the corridor. Shirone ran to her feeling like he had met a savior.

"Teacher! It's me, Shirone!"

If it was Teacher Siena, she couldn't forget him. She was strong. A certified 6th-class magician. But the response that came back was cruel beyond measure.

"Shirone? There's no student by that name in the advanced class. Who are you?"

"Teacher, don't you recognize me? It's Shirone."

Siena tried to recall her memory. But again, it was an unknown name, an unknown face.

"I think there's been some mistake. I haven't heard about any new students coming. Are you really a student at our school?"

Mark and Maria's eyes turned sharp. Shirone, who had suddenly become a suspicious person, was frightened.

"I'm, I'm sorry! I was mistaken!"

"Hey! Wait right there!"

Leaving Siena's voice behind, Shirone desperately ran away. Now he seemed to understand what had happened.

Everyone had forgotten about him.

"Hic, sob..."

He felt like a lost child. Infinitely weak. Everything in the world felt frightening.

Shirone, who had entered Estas, finally arrived at the Supernatural Psychic Research Society after getting lost three times.

'My friends will be fine. Of course they will, why wouldn't they be?'

Hadn't they been exchanging jokes just a few hours ago? Even if the whole world forgot, they at least should remember him.

When he opened the door and entered, Nade and Iruki were chatting. Then they looked surprised when they saw Shirone.

"Nade, Iruki, it's me. I'm Shirone."

His friends just blinked without answering. The dam of emotions he had been holding back collapsed, and Shirone's face turned into a crying expression.

"Why aren't you saying anything? You remember me, right? You didn't forget, did you?"

Nade looked back at Iruki. Then he scratched his head and approached Shirone.

"Um... who are you?"

Tears welled up in Shirone's eyes.

"You really don't know me? We were together until just now. We studied together yesterday and the day before!"

"Sorry, but we don't know you. Did some other research society send you to spy? Don't cause trouble and please leave."

Iruki suddenly shouted as if he had realized something.

"Wait! There might be that possibility. How did you find the way to Estas? Tell me quickly! Who on earth are you?"

"You, you guys..."

Shirone's lower lip protruded. Now he couldn't hold back his tears. No, he didn't want to hold them back either.

"Pff..."

Air leaked from Nade's mouth. Then he clutched his stomach and burst into laughter.

"Puhahaha! Did you see that? Did you see that expression? This is totally a masterpiece!"

"I saw it! I saw it! Completely terrified and going 'you, you guys...' Puhahaha! Shirone, what are you trying to do making me laugh so hard?"

Nade staggered around clutching his aching stomach from laughing too much.

"Ehehehe, ehehehehe! Ah, the more I think about it, the crazier it gets! Why on earth would you do such a thing... Kuhahaha!"

Shirone couldn't understand the situation. He couldn't even tell if it was reality or a dream.

"What, you do remember me?"

"What nonsense are you talking? Did you suddenly have a nightmare or something? Do you know how funny your facial expression looks right now? Puhahaha!"

Shirone felt completely drained. It felt like the boulder that had been weighing on his chest had finally rolled away.

"Geez! Then you should have said something! Why did you pretend not to know me?"

"Your expression when you came in was so funny that we played a little prank. You were like this: 'It's me. I'm Shirone.'"

When Nade imitated Shirone, Iruki rolled on the floor laughing again. Shirone, who didn't even have the energy to scold them, sat down and covered his face with both hands.

"Phew, I was really scared to death."

"Sit down for now. What happened?"

Sitting on the sofa, Shirone enthusiastically recounted the situation from earlier. The kids, who had initially snickered in disbelief, became serious when the story about Teacher Siena came up.

"Hmm, so even Teacher Siena doesn't know? The teacher wouldn't have been playing a prank."

Nade couldn't believe it at all.

"Is such a thing really possible?"

"It's possible with mental-type magic. Of course, whether it's possible to manipulate the memories of all students is questionable."

"It is possible. I experienced it directly."

Iruki calmed down Shirone, who was pounding his chest.

"Alright. Don't get excited. That's just what I'm saying. Anyway, I believe what you're saying. People have lost their memories about you."

Nade said.

"But we remember. This part could be a hint about the situation, couldn't it?"

"I think so too. If there's a reason why we didn't forget Shirone, I can only think of one thing. That we weren't at school for two days. What on earth happened while we were gone?"

Shirone's group fell into thought. Someone manipulated not only all the students but also the faculty's minds while they were away? It was a hypothesis that didn't make sense for now.

"Maybe some supernatural phenomenon occurred? Looking at cases, there have been quite a few similar incidents historically."

Iruki was skeptical.

"Well. I think those cases are also related to magic. Anyway, if it's that kind, how do we explain why we didn't lose our memories?"

"It might be because we were in Estas. We were here continuously after parting with Shirone."

Shirone asked.

"What does that have to do with Estas?"

"There have been rumors from long ago that Estas has mysterious power. Of course, it's just a rumor, but let's try everything we can think of. This concerns our own safety too."

Iruki said.

"In other words, there's a possibility we might lose our memories too."

"We can't guarantee it won't happen."

Silence flowed. It would be sad if people couldn't remember, but it would also be a problem if they themselves lost their memories.

Nade bravely brought up the topic.

"Still... we should go out, right?"

"Right, hiding won't solve anything."

His friends were right. But Shirone, who had already experienced something terrible, didn't look pleased.

"What if you guys forget me too? I might really go crazy then."

"Let's do this. We'll make marks beforehand. So even if we lose our memories, we can avoid the worst-case scenario."
