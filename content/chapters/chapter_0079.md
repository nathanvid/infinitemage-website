Nade picked up a pen and wrote something on his palm. His friends who were watching did the same, carving the same words.

- I have lost my memory. Anyone who knows the keyword can be trusted. The keyword is North Star.

Shirone's group spread their palms with satisfaction. With this marking, they would be able to cooperate even if they lost their memories.

"Alright, that should do it. Let's head out now."

Having regained his confidence, Shirone left Estas.

Students who had finished their classes were coming and going across the campus. Now that he had regained his composure and looked around carefully, there were more than one or two strange things.

Students who would normally move around in groups of three to five were moving individually. Most peculiar of all was that despite walking busily, their routes were completely chaotic.

"Guys, those people..."

"I know. I felt it too. They have no destination. They're just walking around aimlessly, aren't they?"

Nade found someone he knew in the crowd. It was Gabe, a classmate from Class Five.

"Hey, Gabe. Where exactly are you going?"

Gabe approached. Then, as if addressing a complete stranger, he asked back in a dry tone.

"Who are you?"

Nade pouted his lips. But since he had already heard what Shirone had experienced, he didn't mind and asked what he was curious about first.

"Never mind that. Where are you going right now?"

"Where am I going?"

Nade beat his chest in frustration as he spoke.

"You were walking continuously just now. Where's your destination?"

"Me?"

Gabe looked down at his own two legs. Then, like someone who had suddenly realized something, he began looking around.

"Where is... this place?"

"Hey, snap out of it. What's wrong with you? Did anything happen in the past few days? Did you see anyone suspicious?"

"Do you... know me?"

"Of course I know you. How could I not?"

Gabe's face turned pale. Suddenly approaching, he grabbed Nade's shoulders and shook him.

"Then tell me! Who am I? No, where is this place exactly? What... what's my name?"

When the frightened Gabe clutched his head, Nade slowly backed away, preparing for an emergency. Fortunately, Gabe didn't become aggressive. He was just going insane.

"What is this sound? I hear strange sounds! Why do I keep hearing these sounds!"

Gabe shouted while looking around, and his tongue gradually began to twist. Eventually, incomprehensible strange sounds came out.

Shirone's eyes shook in shock. He realized what state Gabe was in. Meanwhile, Iruki, who hadn't noticed yet, listened carefully to the surrounding sounds.

"What sounds is he hearing? Hallucinations?"

Shirone said in a trembling voice.

"No, he's hearing his own voice."

"What? His own voice?"

"He can't remember language. He speaks out of habit but doesn't understand the meaning. That's why he's terrified."

Gabe had completely forgotten the language system. Eventually, as if he had forgotten even syllables, he screamed like a primitive man.

Shirone's group felt chills. Judging by the speed of mental regression, his memories were disappearing quite rapidly.

As time passed, Gabe's voice subsided, the life in his eyes disappeared, and eventually he lost even his motor abilities. At the same time... all the people on the street stopped moving.

A terrifying silence came to the magic school. Like wax figures set up, no one showed any sign of movement.

"What on earth... happened?"

"At any rate, we're safe. We can't be optimistic, but there's room to investigate a little more."

Shirone examined the people one by one. It felt like the world had stopped, like Armin's Stop magic. But time was definitely flowing. Moreover, seeing people occasionally blink their eyes, they weren't frozen either.

"Their thoughts... have stopped."

If it was a type of magic, it was a more dangerous effect than Stop. It could threaten opponents. If one wanted, even a child could harm everyone here.

The three entered the crowd and conducted several experiments. When they tickled a junior, he burst into laughter. But when they stopped tickling, he immediately returned to his stiff expression. When they threatened to poke his eyes, he blinked his eyelids. The nerves were alive.

"Ho, so only thoughts have stopped. This is peculiar."

"Then that means physical strength has limits too. They won't be able to stand like this for long. What are they trying to do?"

"Before that, we need to find out who did this first. Let's walk around a bit more."

Shirone's group headed north. They wanted to confirm whether the graduating class seniors and teachers with high magic levels were in the same situation.

When they reached the uphill road, graduating class students were pouring out through the steel gate's arch.

Shirone's group hid in the bushes.

The fact that only the graduating class was moving while everyone else couldn't was reason enough to be cautious.

Among the crowd of graduating students were unfamiliar faces.

There were a man and woman who appeared to be around Shirone's age, and a man who was completely out of place at a magic school, carrying twin swords.

Lucas whistled and acted frivolously.

"Whew, I've seen many miserable sights in my life, but this is my first time seeing such a desolate scene. They've all become zombies, haven't they?"

Abyss Nova was magic that blocked the memories of those exposed to Nova within 24 hours. Since thinking was impossible without memories, it wouldn't be wrong to call it an inanimate object magic. The order in which memories were blocked was from the most recent and most impressive memories first.

Leading those whose memories had been blocked was Arin's task. Specialized in mental magic, she brought the graduating students to the courtyard where Shirone's group had encountered Gabe.

'Shadow of Capture.'

And there she cast magic again. Her shadow flowed like tentacles in curves, threading through people's shadows.

A unique form that didn't exist in the Four-Direction Style. But for mental magic users, it was the form called orthodox: tentacles.

The tentacle form used Spirit Zone by unraveling it like thin threads, making it much more flexible in changes compared to the Four-Direction Style.

However, it took much longer, requiring at least 20 minutes to pass through all the advanced class students' shadows.

While Arin worked, Lucas passed time by evaluating female students. Being nobles, they all had fair skin and smelled nice. Lucas, scanning their figures with snake-like eyes, stopped when he found a woman to his taste.

"Oh ho. Look at this."

It was a girl whose eyes remained clear even in her memory-lost state. She had a retro style with reddish bangs flowing down to cover one eye, but her appearance was the best among the students.

"She must have quite a personality. I like feisty women."

The moment Lucas's hand reached toward Amy, Canis grabbed his shoulder and turned him around.

"Lucas, stop it. Refrain from undignified behavior."

"What? Lucas, stop it? Are you talking back to me right now?"

"I won't stand for pointless actions."

"Pff!"

Lucas burst into deflated laughter. Had the Parrot Bandits' prestige fallen this low?

"Hey, what's so serious? I heard it's a revenge play anyway. What's wrong with having some fun?"

"It's revenge to restore Master's pride. I won't forgive low-quality behavior."

"What will you do if you don't forgive? Want to fight here?"

"I'll terminate the employment contract."

"Haha! Kid, you seem to be mistaken about something. I'm employed by Arcane, not by you."

"It's all the same. Arin is casting Shadow of Capture. If you act in a way that interferes with the operation, I can fire you at any time. Of course, if you're dissatisfied with that..."

Abyssal whirlpools arose in Canis's eyes.

"I'll kill you right here."

Lucas clicked his tongue and backed away. Having reached the position of vice-captain of the Parrot Bandits by killing numerous mages, he knew how dangerous it was to show hostility in Spirit Zone.

"Geez. Let's drop it. I'll be the only one at a loss if I don't get paid anyway."

"I'm telling you clearly. If you interfere with our work one more time, I won't hold back then either."

"You're awfully strict for partners. And that master of yours is nowhere to be seen. Where exactly did he go?"

"Master is making important preparations. He means for us to handle such simple matters ourselves."

Arcane was currently hiding and recovering the mental strength he had exhausted with Abyss Nova. But since there was nothing good about revealing this, Canis hid the truth.

"Sure, sure, whatever you say."

Lucas's eyes flashed intensely for a brief moment as he answered dismissively and turned away.

'Hmph, he must be hiding somewhere resting.'

Lucas was well-versed in the equivalent exchange of mages. Magic that blocked hundreds of people's memories was at a level that ordinary mages couldn't even attempt. No matter how great a mage he was, he definitely wouldn't be able to exert his full power for a while.

'Your bluffing only lasts for now, kid. There's no way I'd miss such an interesting opportunity.'

When Arin's work ended, the graduating class and advanced class students all began moving at once. Only after they disappeared from sight did Shirone's group emerge from the bushes. From what they observed, it seemed they planned to take all the students somewhere.

"Who exactly are those people?"

"There's no time to think. It seems like there won't be any trouble for a while, but we don't know what they'll do once they reach their destination. Plus, even the teachers were captured."

Shirone said.

"The magic that girl cast seemed like dark magic. Then could the current situation also be their doing?"

"We should consider that possibility low. To cast magic of this scale, first the size of the Zone would have to be enormous. Two of the three people are too young, and one seems to be carrying weapons, so there's a high possibility he's not a mage."

"So there's a third person?"

"We should think so. For now, let's just focus on tracking. If a dangerous situation comes to someone, it won't be too late to step in then."

"Taking over the magic school. He's insane. Moreover, dark magic..."

Harboring an unknown ominous feeling, Shirone's group began following the uninvited guests.

* * *

Ethella remained in the training hall in the same outfit as yesterday. Her eyebrows twitched as she sat cross-legged without moving. Her brow furrowed and her nose bridge contorted. Blood vessels stood out on her neck as she gritted her teeth, and her body began shaking roughly.

Rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble.

Following Ethella's body, the building shook. Dust poured down as the walls and ceiling vibrated. Finally opening her eyes with a flash, she collapsed forward, breathing roughly.

"Haa! Haa!"

Ethella's entire body was drenched in cold sweat after battling the inner demon that had visited at dawn all night long.

'What exactly was that?'

She couldn't pinpoint it exactly, but it was the type that infiltrated human minds and blocked memories. Dark magic belonged to the orthodox school, but the malice contained in the magic was intense enough to drive Ethella's vigilance to extremes. If not for the laws of the Karsis Order, she too would have inevitably lost her memory.

'It's dark magic. But it should be strictly forbidden within the school.'

Ethella checked the time. Though it was bright as midday due to summer, it was time that would remain after school classes ended.

'Was I trapped in the inner demon for more than 12 hours?'

Considering Ethella's supremely pure mental strength, it was tremendously powerful magic. What was even more astounding was that despite completely missing classes, no one had come looking for her here.

It wasn't just her who was affected.

Having thought that far, Ethella rushed out of the training hall without even time to change clothes.

* * *

A flash passed through the sky above the magic school. Then, as if drawn by a magnet, it curved toward the ground and plummeted. Without even an impact sound, one man landed.
