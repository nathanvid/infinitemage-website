"Damn! Am I too late?"

After riding a carriage through the night, Thad cast spatial teleportation the moment he entered Creas and arrived at the main gate. As expected, the guards just stood there blankly, showing no reaction whatsoever.

It was dark magic.

And of a very high level at that.

'I need to find the headmaster first.'

Thad turned his steps toward the faculty dormitory. But before he could take even ten steps, the distinctive roar of spatial teleportation echoed from the sky.

Just as Thad's wariness activated and he entered Spirit Zone, Ethella descended riding on light.

"Professor Ethella! What's the situation?"

Ethella was puzzled when Thad, who had just returned from his business trip, asked as if he already knew about the incident at the school. But since every second counted, she got straight to the point.

"It seems we've been hit by dark magic. All the students and teachers have lost their memories."

Thad had expected this, but facing the reality still left him stunned. No matter how insane someone might be, to launch a surprise attack on Alpheas Magic School, one of the kingdom's five most prestigious institutions.

"There's no time. Please tell me the situation first."

"When I searched with Spirit Zone, I found all the students climbing up the mountain. From their direction, it seems they're heading toward the Impassable Bridge. There are three people leading them, and three others following behind. As for the teachers... it seems I barely managed to escape alone."

While Arcane's dark magic had reached the level of a Great Magician, Ethella was also a bishop of the Carsis Order, so he wouldn't have been able to dominate her mind. Thinking this was at least fortunate, Thad explained what he knew.

"I'll tell you quickly. The one behind this incident is Viktor Arcane. He's a Great Magician who terrorized the world 40 years ago."

"I've heard of him. Why would such a person target a magic school...?"

Thad bit his lip. It was an unpleasant personal matter involving his master Alpheas. But currently, Ethella was the only person he could rely on, and with her character, she would accept it without prejudice.

"Viktor Arcane is... the headmaster's master."

Ethella blinked. But as Thad had expected, she didn't imagine anything beyond what she had heard.

"I see. But Arcane doesn't seem to be among those taking the students away. I don't know what the circumstances are, but we should save the students first."

"No. As Professor Ethella must have sensed, once caught by mental magic, it's not easy to break free. If we try to save the students one by one, we'll end up being counterattacked instead."

"But we can't just leave them be either."

"You said there are three people following behind. Do you know who they might be?"

"I couldn't confirm exactly, but... I think it might be Shirone."

"Shirone?"

The moment he heard Ethella's words, Thad had the same realization. Arcane's magic would have been cast approximately 24 hours ago. The only students who could have been outside the school at that time were Shirone's group, who had been suspended.

"I didn't confirm their appearance, so I'm not certain. But judging by their aura, they felt like Shirone, Nade, and Iruki."

"You're probably right. If it's those kids, they'll be fine for a while. They're smart, so they'll know what needs to be done. Rather than that, leave the children to handle it and please find Arcane, Professor Ethella."

"What about you, Professor Thad?"

"I'll find the headmaster. Finding my master and removing the dark magic is the priority."

Ethella nodded in agreement.

"Understood. Then I'll search for Arcane."

Thad looked around the mountain ridge. The magic school's grounds were so vast that he couldn't even begin to guess where Arcane might be.

"Hundreds of people were affected simultaneously. With such massive magic, his mental strength must be considerably depleted. He's probably hiding somewhere without people. It would be fastest to search centered on the mountain. What's the radius of your Spirit Zone when expanded in zone mode?"

"Hmm, about 2 kilometers in diameter."

Thad nodded after making a rough calculation.

"About five points should be enough. Please patrol with the training ground as your reference point. I'll go to the school."

"Yes. I'll capture Arcane and then save the students."

"Don't overdo it. Arcane is..."

Thad swallowed his words. Telling her the opponent was strong would only inflame her sense of duty. If he couldn't trust a bishop of the Carsis Order and a state-certified zoner, who could he trust?

"No. Please, I'm counting on you."

Feeling responsible as Alpheas's disciple, Thad bowed his head on behalf of his master. Ethella smiled shyly and shook her head.

"I don't know what's going on, but I'm also a teacher at this school. I'll do my best for the students."

"Yes. Then..."

From now on, it was a race against time.

As Thad cast teleportation and flew toward the school, Ethella also finished taking a deep breath and concentrated her mind.

The sequence formula rose at ultra-high speed as Spirit Zone expanded. The unique expansion type that only zoners possessed unfolded, and everything within a 2-kilometer radius was felt through synesthesia.

'First, to Training Ground 26.'

Ethella's body transformed into light and flew toward the mountain peak. She had covered 1 kilometer with a single spatial teleportation.

**The Magician's Battle (1)**

Canis's group had gathered the memory-blocked people at the starting point of the Impassable Bridge.

Arin's face was pale after completing her mission. Even though she was under the influence of Abyss Nova, moving hundreds of humans through mental domination was tremendous hard labor.

Nade, who was watching Canis's group from the bushes, said:

"Why this place of all places? There's nothing but a bridge and cliffs."

"I don't know. Maybe they're waiting for someone?"

Iruki said while counting on his fingers one by one:

"Looking at just these three elements - cliff, mental domination, villains - the answer is obvious. They plan to drop them off the cliff."

"What? Why would they do such a crazy thing?"

"Logically, it doesn't make sense. There's nothing to gain from dropping students. But what if it's an emotional issue? Like grudges or revenge."

Shirone thought there was merit to this. Moreover, if they really intended to commit such an act, just waiting like this wouldn't be enough.

"We need to act before that situation comes. We might even have to fight."

For ten minutes, nothing happened. The students and teachers stood blankly under mental domination, while Canis and Arin waited for their master while looking out beyond the cliff.

"Are you sure this is okay, Canis? We searched the entire school but couldn't bring Alpheas?"

"It can't be helped. Master told us to be especially careful when meeting Alpheas. We just need to do what we can."

"Still... I feel like we're going to get in trouble."

Canis looked back at Arin with an annoyed expression.

"Arin. Master is a good person. He would never scold us over something like this, so don't worry."

Lucas, who had been listening to their conversation, was starting to get irritated. He had followed them because they promised a large sum of money, but he hadn't known they would commit terrorism against the entire magic school.

Considering the difficulty of the mission, even the advance payment he had received was on the small side. Moreover, Arcane still hadn't appeared despite being far past the promised time.

"Hey. When exactly is your master coming? He didn't run away, did he?"

This was an incident involving a surprise attack on one of the kingdom's five most prestigious institutions. Considering that most of the students were from first-class nobility, the aftermath would be tremendous even if this affair ended safely. Even if he was a Great Magician, the possibility that he had gotten scared and fled couldn't be ruled out.

"Don't carelessly judge our master. He's not someone the likes of you should mention."

"Hah. I really can't believe this."

Lucas scratched his head irritably. Then suddenly he raised his head and glared at Canis with the eyes of a viper he had never shown before.

"You, do I look that easy to you?"

As hostility beyond normal levels surged forth, Arin, who had excellent mental sensitivity, hastily stepped back. In contrast, Canis maintained a calm expression. He had experienced this kind of gaze countless times in Radum.

'Snake Eyes, is it?'

By striking the midbrain with his gaze to paralyze the central nervous system, it was one of the schema techniques that manifested through actual combat experience and innate tendencies rather than training. Just seeing him use Snake Eyes, one could guess what kind of life Lucas had lived.

"Being lenient because you're young is over. You'd better watch your words from now on. You were going on about contracts and such, but it's your side that's making the work run late, isn't it?"

This time, Canis couldn't argue back. Why wasn't his master coming? For someone who had waited for today more than anyone, being late was definitely strange.

As Canis remained silent and withdrew his fighting spirit, Lucas also released his Snake Eyes. In any case, they were still on the same team, and above all, there was still the matter of receiving the remaining payment.

'I shouldn't have followed them from the beginning.'

Lucas looked back at those caught in Abyss Nova. Since their metabolism was normal, there wasn't much time left for them to keep standing. Once people with weak stamina started collapsing, handling them would become even more complicated.

"Hey, how about we just kill them now? It would be troublesome if they fainted. We can't throw them off one by one."

Lucas had been hired as a professional swordsman. While magicians were good for taking multiple lives, there was nothing better than a swordsman for cutting the throats of survivors one by one. Since everyone would become Lucas's responsibility once their stamina was depleted anyway, he was thinking of reducing the numbers in advance.

"Not until Master arrives. The key to the operation is massacring them before Alpheas's eyes."

"Tch, then let's at least have some fun. They're all going to fall off the cliff in a little while anyway."

Canis glared at him with disgust, but in the current situation, there was no justification to stop him. Being from Radum, he knew how dangerous humans like Lucas were. Eventually, Lucas would do what he wanted anyway. That irritated him to the point of revulsion.

"You piece of garbage."

Lucas's steps came to an abrupt halt. He should have killed Canis with the first Snake Eyes. Since the human brain adapts to shock, repeating Snake Eyes on the same target was less effective.

"Keke, do you know why I hate you? Because you act like you have some great conviction. You and I are both just criminals. After today, you'll also be a murderer who massacred hundreds of people."

"I don't uphold my convictions to seem great. I just find humans like you disgusting."

"Haha? Really? You know what's really disgusting? Weak people who are all talk. What are you going to do about finding me disgusting?"

Lucas turned to face forward and grabbed Siena by the throat. Lifting her contorted body with one hand, he strode toward the cliff of the Impassable Bridge.

"Once I kill one person, you'll understand. That you're the same garbage as me."

As Lucas extended his arm, Siena's legs dangled beyond the cliff edge. Choking sounds continuously burst from her mouth.

"This woman's not bad either. It's a shame to kill her, but well..."

Lucas relaxed his grip and dropped Siena. At the same time, sparks flew in his pupils. A feeling like hair standing on end. It was the unique stimulation of Spirit Zone that only schema users could feel.

'Where?'

His sensitive nervous system caught the focal point of the Spirit Zone. As he leaped into the air, an explosion occurred with a bang where his right knee had been. If it had hit directly, the bone would have been shattered.

Lucas landed and immediately rolled backward, putting distance between them. Even without knowing the radius of the Spirit Zone, maintaining maximum distance was standard practice in anti-magician combat.
