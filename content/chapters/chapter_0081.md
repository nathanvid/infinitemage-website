Nade and Iruki, who had cast teleportation, appeared in front of the cliff at the Unbridgeable Bridge. The eyes of the two who had witnessed the humiliation Siena suffered were blazing with fury.

"How dare someone like you to our teacher..."

"What, there were still guys in their right minds? Honestly, these mages..."

Lucas was equally displeased. For someone calling himself a Great Magician to make the mistake of missing his target. Moreover, all the humans who were mentally sound were his share to deal with.

"So that woman was your teacher? My apologies. She should have arrived by now. At the bottom of the ground, that is. Kekeke."

The moment Lucas finished speaking, Shirone, who had embraced Siena, came up from below the cliff using teleportation. His eyes held the same intensity as his friends'. How corrupt must one be to push a person off a cliff?

"I won't forgive you."

Lucas didn't even listen with half an ear. He was just annoyed by the situation getting more complicated.

"Hey. What are you going to do? Is this included in the plan too?"

Lucas made the responsibility clear. There could be issues when paying the remaining fee. Canis didn't avoid it either. In the absence of Arcane, he was the leader.

"Arin, stay back."

"But Canis..."

"You don't need to step forward. Focus on the task of controlling the people. I'll handle this myself."

It would be too much to fight while maintaining mental domination over hundreds of people. As Arin hid among the people, Canis, feeling relieved, approached Shirone's group.

"What are you guys? How did you break free from the mental domination?"

Iruki spoke.

"Dark magic is already outdated magic, isn't it? Methods to break it are everywhere."

"Nonsense. If it could be broken that easily, those guys in the back wouldn't have been caught either."

'That's true...'

Canis looked up at the sun. Being on a mountain peak, it was still a time when the light was strong. But a Great Magician's disciple wouldn't need to negotiate conditions against students.

Lucas, who had been watching with his arms crossed, shouted.

"Hey, what are you going to do? This wasn't in the contract. I might handle it if you pay me double."

"I don't need help. I'll handle it alone."

"Then do as you please."

Lucas clicked his tongue and stepped back. It seemed like he wouldn't interfere, but his true feelings were the opposite. He would pretend to be uninterested while waiting, then strike from behind when the battle started. That would be the end.

"Hurry up and attack. I'm a busy man."

Shirone and Canis slowly closed the distance. The Spirit Zone of Canis felt through synesthesia was roughly a sphere with a 50-meter diameter, similar to Shirone's level.

"I'll handle this, so you guys block that swordsman."

At Shirone's words, Iruki looked back at Lucas.

"That guy? From the atmosphere, it doesn't seem like he'll interfere."

"You never know how things might change when the situation arises. He's vicious enough to push Teacher Siena off a cliff."

Shirone said with cold eyes as he looked back.

"Don't believe anything that man says."

Iruki gulped. Shirone, who had switched his mental circuits to combat mode, had different eyes from usual.

Shirone began timing. Photon Output boasted exceptional casting speed even among attack magic. But dark magic wasn't behind in speed either.

No signal could be read from Canis's eyes. Like the black pupils of an orangutan, only an uncertain future swirled within.

It wasn't human. Eyes that were extremely animalistic, which only those who had survived countless times could possess.

What kind of life would one have to live to have such eyes?

Both men wiggled their fingers. And the moment a bird fluttered up, they moved simultaneously. Photon Output and the Power of Darkness moved dazzlingly, dizzying the eyes.

Shirone cast teleportation and soared upward. The Power of Darkness that followed vertically melted in the sunlight.

Canis sneered. What he was aiming for wasn't Shirone's body but the shadow buried in the ground. Shirone, who belatedly remembered the properties of dark magic, hastily moved outside the cliff. As the shadow disappeared 1,000 meters below, the Power of Darkness that lost its target extinguished like a flame.

As Photon Output shot like a machine gun, Canis cast Shadow Wall. A thick wall of shadows rose before his eyes and absorbed all the photons.

'Tremendous power. To block light with darkness.'

Dark power that went against the natural order. Shirone, who had increased the power of Photon Output through thousands of rebounds, could guess how strong Canis's mental power was.

'Then how about this?'

Concentrating photons in his hand, Shirone gritted his teeth and threw it. As the Photon Cannon fired, Canis maximized the thickness of his defensive wall. His smile lasted only briefly before the Shadow Wall exploded and a flash of light struck.

'What is this?'

Feeling chilled, Canis instinctively cast Dark Skin. As his body turned black, the Photon Cannon struck his abdomen.

"Kuk...!"

The impact limit that Dark Skin could absorb was already exceeded at the moment of collision, and the shockwave shook his internal organs. Canis's body, flying with both feet lifted, was buried in the forest.

"Canis!"

Arin couldn't believe it. Light containing physical force? Light was pure energy. If even a small amount of physical force was contained, all planets where the sun existed would have been shattered.

Lucas's expression also became serious for the first time. Magic where light beams flew quickly and struck the opponent. Even if he had been in Canis's place, the probability of avoiding it would have been fifty-fifty.

'This might not just be bad luck but stepping in shit.'

Murderous intent appeared in Lucas's eyes. It wasn't a profitable deal, but shouldn't the remaining fee be paid? His twin swords, watching Shirone, vibrated tremblingly.

* * *

Ethella was somewhere in the mountain range 800 meters away from the Unbridgeable Bridge. And in front of her was Arcane, who had reached the unofficial 3rd-grade Great Magician rank 40 years ago.

From Arcane's perspective, she was an unwelcome guest. Even though he had rested, the mental power consumed while casting Abyss Nova had only recovered about 60 percent.

But such thoughts were brief. Arcane narrowed his eyes as he realized the true worth of the woman blocking his path.

'Ho, look at this?'

She wore large glasses that made her look foolish. Her chest was also fully developed, and she had the appearance of a gentle sheep who wouldn't know anything about combat.

But he felt it through his skin. Just by standing there, all the energy flowing through her body had no obstruction.

Especially her pupils were spectacular. The spirit of a sage who had transcended the eight emotions of joy, anger, love, hatred, desire, fear, sorrow, and pleasure was emanating through her pupils.

She was a seeker of truth.

And one too excellent to be a teacher at a magic school.

'She's capable of breaking Abyss Nova.'

Ethella was equally tense facing the authority of dark magic who had made a name as a Great Magician before she was even born.

"I have heard your distinguished name."

"Which order are you from?"

Arcane guessed that Ethella was a nun even without hearing. But the following answer far exceeded his expectations.

"I am Bishop Ethella of the Carsis Order. I wonder why someone who made a name with dark magic in the past would commit such atrocious acts."

"A bishop."

Arcane burst into laughter as if absurd. Having the position of bishop before the age of thirty was impossible during his heyday.

Especially if it was Carsis, it was one of the most distinguished orders on a continent with 2,000 parishes. And a bishop was a position responsible for one parish, equivalent to at least the head of a city.

"Where is Alpheas?"

Ethella remained silent. She didn't know where he was either, but even such facts could be information for the enemy.

"I can hear you thinking from here. It's fine to speak honestly. I never thought that cunning brat would fall for my magic so easily."

Calling Alpheas, who was over sixty, a cunning brat showed how long the Great Magician standing before her had lived.

"Why are you looking for the headmaster? If there's a grudge, it would be proper to meet and resolve it directly. If you free the students from mental domination and withdraw, I could arrange a meeting."

"Kekeke! It seems that brat has built quite a reputation while I was gone. But child, Alpheas isn't the kind of human you think. He's the most foolish and arrogant person in the world."

"Whatever the past, it doesn't matter. The current headmaster is someone respected by his students."

"Ho, is that so?"

Arcane playfully stroked his chin. Come to think of it, his memory of Alpheas was limited to the twenty-something brat burning with youth.

"I'm curious. What exactly did that brat do to earn respect? Let me hear about it."

Ethella grasped Arcane's strategy. In just a little while, it would be time for the sun to set. It was a trick to buy time until night when dark magic would be most effective.

"If you're waiting for darkness, please stop. As a teacher, I cannot stand by and watch more evil acts."

"What?"

Arcane frowned unpleasantly. How dare a child 120 years younger treat him like a mage who just buys time?

Casting the Power of Darkness, Arcane's shadow devoured the trees. The branches rustled, and the trunks began bending toward a single point.

"Did you think I was afraid of you just because some sun was up? Then you've made light of this Arcane."

Ethella looked up. Trees within a radius of several hundred meters all tilted at once, forming a huge dome entangled like a net. As the sky closed, the surroundings became darker than night.

"Die. Insolent thing."

Arcane disappeared into his own shadow with a swoosh. It was Dark Port, a specialty of dark magic. By using the property of becoming one with darkness to erase the concept of distance, one could move instantly anywhere there was shadow.

The ability to approach without even a trace was Dark Port's greatest strength. The moment Arcane, having taken the rear, cast the Power of Darkness, Ethella's body transformed into a flash of light and moved away. Dozens of shadow hands clawed at empty air.

Starting with Arcane casting Dark Port again, ultra-high-speed combat unfolded. It seemed as if there were dozens of Arcanes and Ethellas. As Arcane drove Ethella into a narrow radius, Ethella linked teleportations at extreme speed from where she stood. Her upper body appeared overlapped countless times as shadow hands penetrated through insubstantial afterimages.

'Bishop of the Carsis Order. Indeed quite skilled.'

Even Arcane, who had been harboring anger, couldn't help but admire. While the magnitude of her spirit didn't match his, her technique and senses were far beyond her age group.

"Then I'll have to strike at the weak point."

Ethella's pupils wavered with bewilderment. As the Power of Darkness strengthened, over thousands of hands were flying simultaneously.

Truly unfathomable magical power.

While a Zoner's detection ability could be called magic itself, even so, she couldn't avoid all thousands of hands.

As a tree branch's shadow grabbed her wrist, Ethella hastily stopped her movement. If she cast teleportation in this state, her arm would be torn off.

"Uurgh...!"

The shadow's tension was tough like rubber. But Ethella's strength was no joke either. Gritting her teeth and pulling her arm, the middle part of the shadow tore with a ripping sound.

'She has physical skills too? A sturdy child.'

Arcane spoke with a bitter smile.

"If that's your preference, I'll accommodate you."
