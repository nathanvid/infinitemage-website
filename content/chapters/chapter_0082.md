Sensing the killing intent, Ethella turned to look beside her. A shadow burst forth from the darkness in mid-air at tremendous speed, striking her jaw hard.

'A fist?'

Dozens of shadow fists followed. Ethella crouched down and covered her vital points with both arms. Even as the dull sounds of impact echoed through the mountains, she didn't budge an inch, as if she had taken root.

'Ho? Still holding up even with this?'

Any ordinary person would have had every bone in their body broken. But Ethella's eyes, visible between her guard, remained clear and focused.

"I acknowledge your durability, but let's end this now."

Shadow hands appeared from all directions, seizing the groggy Ethella. As the Power of Darkness gripping her wrists and ankles applied force, her limbs were spread outward. Her large glasses hung crookedly with cracks, and blood flowed from her lips.

Arcane cast Poison Cutter. It was a triple mix magic that imbued rotating darkness with toxicityâ€”far more difficult than fusion magic.

The blade-sharp magic cleaved through the air as it rushed forward. Intuiting that it was a lethal technique, Ethella used all her strength to break free from the shadows, then took a deep breath and let out a scream.

"AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!"

The high-frequency roar that charged through the underbrush, toppling it, shattered Arcane's darkness like smoke.

It was the monk technique called Pharma's Cry.

Carsis Jung, the ancestor of the Carsis Order, once said that the awakening that rouses the human spirit comes with a great roar. Pharma's Cry was a righteous technique that created a roar to shatter evil magic. It worked on the same principle as a sinner being startled by thunder.

Buried in the roar, Arcane shuddered. His skin tingled and his hair stood on end. To think that a woman barely in her mid-twenties could wield Pharma's Cry, something he had encountered only a few times in his 130 years of life.

'Kekeke, this is why I can't leave this world.'

The greatest talent hones a single ability to its extreme, wielding a mind sharpened like a famous blade.

What an interesting thing this is.

Someone will die, someone will survive.

Through countless cycles of destruction, creation, and regeneration, doesn't magic develop?

'That's how it is. Indeed.'

Arcane cast Poison Cutter again. Judging that there would be no opportunity if not now, Ethella severed the Power of Darkness gripping her ankles and cast spatial teleportation. As the flash flew in a curved path, the Poison Cutter pierced through the afterimage of light.

"Whew."

Arcane whistled. The stronger a person is, the greater their sense of humiliation when fleeing. But the judgment to retreat without hesitation was also important in battle.

Arcane headed to where Ethella had been standing. Blood had dripped there, suggesting she hadn't completely avoided the attack. If the poison had seeped in, she wouldn't have been able to flee very far.

"That tomboy is going to have quite a rough time."

Arcane was delighted to meet a strong opponent after 40 years. He had witnessed a genius who possessed the trinity: a Zoner's Spirit Zone, physical techniques that could sever the Power of Darkness, and the supreme spirit of a monk.

'A certified 6th-grade mage, was it?'

It was certainly a high rank for her age. But those who don't conform to social standards are geniuses precisely because of that. If she hadn't been bound by missions like teaching or seeking enlightenment, Ethella's current rank would have been much higher.

"Mirhi Alpheas. That brat receives respect?"

Arcane lifted his head with sad eyes. As the mental domination was released, the trees straightened their bent backs, revealing the darkened sky.

"Aren't you ashamed, Alpheas? Receiving respect from someone superior to you. What a tragic reality this is."

Lamenting his disciple's incompetence, Arcane slowly began walking. The darkness spread across the forest was showing him the path he needed to take.

* * *

'Damn! Where on earth are you?'

Thad grew increasingly anxious. Alpheas wasn't at the lodging where he was certain to be. If he hadn't been captured by the enemy either, then only one place remained.

"Master!"

He burst through the door of the principal's office. But Alpheas wasn't visible here either.

Thad didn't give up and examined the books displayed on the bookshelf. He had long known that Alpheas had created a personal space here.

'There must be a mechanism. But I can't examine every single book.'

His rapidly moving gaze caught sight of one book. Among the stuffy magic texts was a book titled "Seeing the Darkness." Knowing his master's past, Thad was certain this was the pathway directly connected to Alpheas's memories.

When he pulled the upper part of the book, a heavy mechanism turned and the bookshelf split left and right. Beyond the wall, a tunnel was carved out with stairs leading downward.

As Thad descended the stairs, the tilted book returned to position and the bookshelf closed. Opening an iron door revealed a small room with crystal lamps. Numerous items were displayed on old shelves, so antique-looking that it could have been mistaken for a curio shop.

A woman's portrait hung on the wall. Though not exceptionally beautiful, she had a gentle and refined impression.

'That person must be...'

Thad stared at the portrait in a daze. What Alpheas had said was true. Her eyes seemed to possess a magic that drew people in.

"Who are you?"

Thad flinched and turned around. Alpheas was sitting in a corner chair with his hands on his knees. His face, contorted with anger and bewilderment, was completely different from usual.

"Master! You're safe after all!"

"You... seem to know me."

Thad, who had been approaching, stopped. From Alpheas's words, he could guess the situation.

"You've lost your memory."

Like the other teachers, Alpheas had clearly been affected by Arcane's magic. But befitting a certified 4th-grade mage, he seemed to have taken measures before completely losing his memory and fled to this place.

Hearing Thad's words, Alpheas approached a bronze mirror and examined his appearance with a serious expression.

"Hmm. Lost my memory? I thought I had suddenly jumped to the future. Anyway, to think my 18-year-old face has become this old man. Quite annoying."

Thad's eyes widened. Eighteen years old meant approximately 40 years had been blocked off. If Alpheas weren't an extremely rational person, he might have already gone mad.

"Yes, I lost my memory... Actually, that's rather fortunate. At least my life wasn't stolen. But where is this? What happened that made me lose my memory?"

"A certain mage cast dark magic to harm you, Master. You barely escaped."

Though telling someone who had lost their memory would only increase their anxiety, Alpheas seemed unconcerned.

"Is that so? How old am I now?"

"Ah, you're sixty-three."

"Sixty-three. Then what have I become?"

"Pardon?"

"I'm asking what magical achievements I've accomplished."

"Ah, as a person of excellent character, you currently serve as the principal of a magic school."

Alpheas made a dumbfounded expression. To think that the genius called the light of the Mirhi family was teaching others. Considering his personality, it was something that could never happen.

"So what, I became a teacher?"

"Yes. Everyone follows and respects you, Master."

"Puhahahaha! Puhahahaha!"

Alpheas burst into wild laughter. At first, he had been annoyed at suddenly becoming old, but since learning he had lost his memory, he didn't mind. Rather, thinking about hearing his achievements from now on made him excited.

"I must have matured quite a bit. Principal, huh. Then is this place the royal palace? Has the prince inherited the throne?"

Thad became anxious. No matter how rational Alpheas was, the gap of jumping 40 years couldn't be ignored.

"This is a private school. It's Alpheas Magic School, which you established yourself, Master."

"Private?"

Alpheas's face crumpled. If it were the genius mind of Alpheas, he should at least be teaching royalty. But a private school? What on earth had happened in those 40 years of life?

"...What grade am I?"

"Pardon? Ah, that's, well..."

Thad hesitated. Countless records proved how remarkable Alpheas had been in his youth. Under such circumstances, he didn't have the courage to honestly reveal the reality.

"Speak quickly! What grade am I! You said I'm sixty-three, right? Then am I 1st grade? Or 2nd grade?"

Thad bowed his head like someone who had committed a mortal sin and spoke.

"4th grade..."

Alpheas staggered. The shock was too great for his aged body to handle. But soon, unable to contain his burning anger, he threw a tantrum.

"What the hell did I do! You idiot! Pathetic fool!"

Alpheas hit his head, blaming himself. If he had devoted 40 years with the talent given by God, he should have been at least 2nd grade. But 4th grade, not even 3rd?

What could have happened? What foolish thoughts had he lived with to reach this state?

He needed to know the past. Everything from beginning to end. Having made his decision, Alpheas glared at Thad and spoke.

"You can dispel dark magic, right? Since you're my disciple, you must have learned photon magic?"

"Yes. I don't know how long it will take, but if you help me, Master, it should be possible. However..."

Thad suddenly realized.

Perhaps this wasn't a curse but a blessing?

Due to a mistake in his youth, Alpheas had lived for 40 years in guilt. If losing his memory could settle the past, his lifelong regret would disappear.

"Master, do you really need to regain your memory?"

"What? What are you talking about? It's my memory, so of course I need to get it back. Something must have gone wrong. If I just fix that, I can still reach higher levels even now."

"Master. You must be unable to accept the current situation. The light of the Mirhi family, called a God-given talent, is merely staying in a certified 4th-grade principal position. But that's exactly why I want to dissuade you even more. You made a great mistake, Master. And you've lived in anguish for 40 years. Now it's time to be free. Perhaps this is God's pardon?"

Though he had regressed to 18 years old, Alpheas knew enough about how past wounds could torment one's life. Also, if such a thing had really happened, accepting it and living this way was one method.

Pacing around the room deep in thought, Alpheas suddenly noticed the portrait on the wall and asked.

"Who is that woman? Isn't this my room?"

"It is your room, Master."

"Really? I hung that picture? She's not even beautiful, and why are her eyes so vacant? Like some deficient woman."

Thad's emotions welled up. Knowing who she was to Alpheas, he couldn't contain his sadness.

'Master, you shouldn't say such things. That person is...'

Alpheas turned his gaze from the picture with an annoyed expression. Nothing about this or that made any sense.

"I'll regain my memory. This future deviates too much from my plans. I need to know what happened."

"Master, please reconsider. Life is..."

"Hey, you."

Alpheas cut off Thad's words with an arrogant look. Thad realized there wasn't a shred of falsehood in his master's words. That appearance was exactly the young Alpheas.

"You said you're my disciple?"

"That's correct. It's an honor too great for me, and I'm always grateful."

"Then as of today, you're expelled."

"What?"

Alpheas was serious. He was the great Alpheas. Even having lost 40 years of memory, he was a crystallization of intellect who didn't bat an eye.

"What's so important about regaining some trivial past memories? I don't need such a pathetic disciple like you."
