"That's precisely why I'm telling you this. Don't you understand, Master?"

Even if he regained his memories, there was no guarantee that Alpheas would return to his former self. Just because someone lives the same life twice doesn't mean they'll always arrive at the same destination.

"No. My judgment is always correct. That's why no matter what form I take, I'll only be myself. This is your last chance. Cast the photon magic."

Thad sighed and nodded his head. Now he could only hope that Alpheas's nature would help him regain his original personality.

"I understand. Then please sit here."

Thad brought a chair from the corner and seated Alpheas.

"I'll begin now. I'll cast the photon magic, but from that point on, it's up to you, Master."

"Haha! You think you're capable of worrying about my part? Stop with the useless concerns and hurry up. Once I regain my memories, I'll give you quite the scolding."

Thad cast the magic with desperate hope. As light seeped into Abyss Nova, a slight drowsiness washed over him. Alpheas slowly closed his eyes and fell into thought. Time that had stopped at age 18 began to flow again.

**Light and Darkness, Good and Evil (1)**

Buried in the bushes, Canis couldn't move a finger while the shockwave that had spread through his abdomen lingered.

Ever since he realized that Arin had talent in telepathy, he had intensively trained in dark-based physical magic.

Absorbing force was also a physical power, and as such, the shock absorption capacity of the Dark Skin he cast was considerably high. Even a hammer swung by an adult would be nothing more than a child's punch against Dark Skin.

However, the power of the Photon Cannon that had caught him off guard was destructive force far beyond his expectations. Above all, it was impossible to even analyze how light could contain physical force.

"Kekeke. You really got hit hard, Canis."

A hoarse voice stimulated his ears. Though no one else was visible in the mountains besides Canis, the voice was real.

"Habyst... What did I get hit by?"

"I don't know. But from what I can sense, it was mass. An enormous mass flying at tremendous speed that struck your abdomen."

"Mass? Light has no mass."

Since studying opposing attributes was fundamental for battle mages, Canis also knew about photon theory.

"Of course light has no mass. But it does have energy."

In reality, moving photons do have an infinitesimal amount of mass. This is called kinetic mass, with solar wind being a prime example.

"But that's just mathematical reduction. It's similar to feeling like you've been hit by a club when strong wind blows."

"What you say makes sense. But it's theoretically possible, isn't it? Then it's not completely impossible either."

"No, something's missing. To produce this level of power, there must be something connecting mass and energy. But nothing like that exists in the world."

The voice called Habyst spoke in a disinterested tone.

"Looks like he found it though."

Canis didn't respond. Though he and Habyst were clearly separate entities, they were also one being sharing thoughts. Reading Canis's unpleasant emotions, Habyst reluctantly acknowledged it.

"He's remarkable. A unique one. So the magic school had such talent after all."

Only then satisfied, Canis raised his body. Accurately assessing the enemy's abilities was the first step toward victory. The first worthy opponent he'd encountered. His body temperature seemed to rise.

"Can we win, Habyst?"

"Kekeke. Canis, if you want it..."

The ominous voice melted into the darkness.

"There's no enemy we can't defeat."

Canis stretched out his abnormally long shadow and returned to the mountain peak where Shirone was.

* * *

Shirone stared into the forest darkness for quite some time. Though he couldn't be certain that Canis had cast Dark Skin, information that had only reached his retina without reaching his brain was sending warning signals.

Canis emerged, cutting through the forest. As Shirone's prediction proved correct, Nade frowned.

"Damn. He really is fine?"

"Nade. The sun has set."

Since dark magic's power would be maximized at night, Iruki cast illumination magic. The brightness was far inferior to Fire Line, so Nade added his power. Two luminous bodies shone 10 meters above ground. But considering that mages moved at high speed, it was still difficult to engage in full combat.

"Tch. It's still dark even with this?"

At that moment, Canis cast illumination magic. The light magic cast by a dark mage made both of them feel uncomfortable.

"What's he thinking? Illumination magic of all things."

"What's wrong with that? Any school requires learning photon theory as essential. It's the basic principle of teleportation."

"That's not what I mean! Light should be a weakness for dark mages, right? Why would he do something that cuts into his own flesh?"

"Hahaha! Hahahaha!"

Canis burst into laughter.

"As expected, magic school graduates are stupid and inflexible. No magic of any school is without weaknesses. What matters is finding ways to compensate for those weaknesses. The illumination magic is to prove just that. Arin, shoot one more."

It didn't seem like baseless confidence, as even the cautious Arin obediently cast illumination magic.

With four luminous bodies gathered, it was quite as bright as daylight. But Canis wasn't satisfied and looked back at Shirone. The light mage who wielded unique omniscience. With his illumination magic, they could create the stage he desired.

"Hey, why don't you shoot one too? I'm looking forward to it."

Shirone didn't know how to cast illumination magic. While achieving technical evolution from teleportation to Rainbow Drop, and from photon output to Photon Cannon, he hadn't had time to invest in other magic.

"What? Don't tell me you can't do it? How ridiculous. A light mage who can't even cast illumination magic."

Sometimes such cases existed. Those with short magical strings who gained opportunity and showed prowess in only one type of magic. While they might become quite famous in something like a circus, magic wasn't a trick but a killing technique. In battlefields where all sorts of psychology and tactics ran rampant, types like Shirone who could only do one thing were perfect for dying.

"I was thinking wrong. I thought it would be a good match, but you're just a novice who's neither here nor there?"

The moment Canis finished speaking, a luminous body popped up above Shirone's head. It was bright enough light to make everyone else's illumination magic look pale.

Nade and Iruki stared at it blankly. He had immediately cast illumination magic that he'd never learned before. More than his limitless insight, they first felt his anger.

Shirone stepped boldly into Canis's Spirit Zone. He couldn't forgive someone who held the entire student body hostage and then spoke of a good match.

"Is this good enough? I did what you wanted, so try whatever you want."

Canis retracted his earlier thoughts. This wasn't simply a mage good at circus tricks. But did it matter? No matter how strong the opponent, he was stronger. The current situation was perfect for proving that.

"Whatever I want? You'll regret those words."

As he cast the Power of Darkness, the shadow beneath his feet rushed toward Shirone like rapids. Shirone, who had flown into the sky, raised a photon above his palm. He'd thought something amazing would happen, but it was the same attack pattern as before.

'Did he just make me angry to show off?'

As Shirone cast Photon Cannon, Canis's body suddenly disappeared beneath the shadow. This one was somewhat new, but it was still just movement magic learned from books. As he rained bombardment on Canis who appeared from all directions like a mole, the mountain peak was devastated.

'Got him!'

Strategically analyzing Canis's movement pattern, Shirone fired a predictive shot at an absolutely unavoidable location. Canis appeared belatedly at the spot where the Photon Cannon was falling. Evasion impossible. Moreover, it was powerful enough that even Dark Skin couldn't block it.

Just when everyone thought it was over, a shadow rose from beneath Canis's feet. It looked like a human shadow stretched long, and it caught the Photon Cannon with both hands and abdomen. The photon caught between its palms was absorbed into the shadow with a pop sound.

Startled, Shirone landed on the ground. The shadow had destroyed the Photon Cannon. That meant darkness had overwhelmed light.

"Kekeke, spectacular entrance. How was I?"

"How is that possible? For darkness to devour light..."

Nade couldn't believe it. No matter how strong dark force was, it couldn't suppress light. How would it feel if you lit a torch but the surroundings didn't brighten at all?

The monster connected to Canis's shadow wasn't hindered in its actions at all, even while illumination magic lit the ground.

While its face was small, its shoulders and chest were enormous. Its waist was slender like a leopard's, and its arms were long like a monkey's. Its palms were broad like shields, and its fingers were thin and long like blades. The fact that its physical balance felt beautiful was proof it was an artificial creation.

"Keke, didn't I tell you I was nothing special? Hey, novice. The photons you shot really tasted good."

When the shadow spoke, Shirone was dumbfounded. Moreover, using the expression 'photons' rather than light meant it possessed intellectual capabilities.

Canis introduced his shadow.

"The essence of dark magic. The strongest magical creature, Habyst."

"A magical creature?"

The pinnacle of magical biology combining alchemy and magical engineering. Seeing what he'd only read about in books felt truly bizarre. Moreover, it was an intellectual creature that had never been introduced in any book.

"Kekeke! That guy's completely stunned, isn't he? What's with this reaction, like some country bumpkin seeing a magical creature for the first time?"

Habyst, showing off his crude wit, shrugged his shoulders and laughed. Was it a frivolous and eccentric monster? No, it was a creature with extremely human yet transcendent qualities.

"Habyst is immune to light. Also, it's connected to my life. As long as I don't die, Habyst won't perish either."

"That's right, that's right! We're two yet one! One yet two! Though I'm better looking, of course. It's true! I'm incredibly handsome, but there's no way to show it. Kehehehe!"

Though Habyst spouted jokes, Shirone had no time to pay attention to such things. If it was immune to light, then even the dark mage's only weakness had disappeared.

'Can I... win?'

There was still no help from outsiders, and Alpheas's location wasn't even clear. In the end, the lives of hundreds of people depended on those present here.

Canis was satisfied with Shirone's bewildered appearance. The effect of revealing Habyst after the illumination magic was excellent. This too was Habyst's strategy. The frivolous speech and attitude were perfect acting. In reality, Habyst was an even more intellectual being than Canis. It had transferred the entire knowledge of an Arcane. Even at this moment, Habyst was continuously exchanging brainwave patterns with Canis.

- Canis. Let's go into the forest. We're at a disadvantage here.

- Will they easily follow?

- They're the ones in a hurry. Besides, Lucas is quite strong. If we can get him moving, our forces will increase.

- I don't like it. I don't want help from such a bastard. If you hadn't stopped me earlier, we would have fought.

- It's for you, Canis. He's strong and not stupid either. Based on total numerical values, you're at a disadvantage. I can't let you get caught up in wasteful emotional fighting.

Lucas was another face of the villains who had tormented Canis in Radum. Thinking he had to receive help from such a person made his insides boil.

- Canis. Your heart rate has increased 1.7 times. When adrenaline levels rise, judgment becomes clouded. If you're angry because of what I said, I apologize.

The magical creature's consideration to prevent combat power loss calmed Canis's heart. With the cold and calculating Habyst by his side, he was confident he wouldn't lose to anyone.

- No, Habyst. I'm sorry. Your judgment is correct. Let's begin.
