Canis cleared his mind of distracting thoughts and glared at Shirone. His insides twisted at the sight of that pretty face that looked like it had never known hardship.

'Hmph. You probably think I'm the villain. But...'

The Power of Darkness rose from Canis's shadow. Even as it was shaved away by the illumination magic, its regeneration speed was tremendous.

'To me, you people are the real evil!'

As the Power of Darkness charged forward, Shirone cleanly swept the ground with his photon output. Then he grabbed the Photon Cannon mounted on his right hand and threw it. Harvest intercepted it, taking the blow with his body. As the Photon Cannon burrowed into his torso, Harvest's body was pushed back into the forest with a thud. But far from showing any impact, he wiggled his long fingers and taunted Shirone.

"Kekeke. Come in, come in."

For a dark magician, the forest was like home ground, but Shirone charged into the woods without hesitation. Then he fired dozens of photons overhead, sweeping from left to right and right to left.

Bang bang bang bang bang bang! Bang bang bang bang bang bang!

About a hundred illumination rounds pierced through the forest canopy and rose into the sky. Nade and Iruki stared in bewilderment at the sky that had brightened like midday.

"That bastard's really gone all out."

"He knows it himself. If Shirone can't stop that guy, we end up losing this game."

Iruki slowly turned his gaze. Lucas was heading into the forest following Shirone. When he noticed gray smoke rising before his eyes, Lucas quickly threw himself aside. An Atomic Bomb exploded with a pop, and Lucas, who had instantly retreated ten meters, glared at Iruki with terrifying eyes.

"You little bastard..."

"Don't do anything pointless. We're thinking the same thing you are. Just stay put where you are."

"This is ridiculous."

No matter how immature they were, for mere magic apprentices to step up against a B-class criminal was absurd. When Lucas drew his twin swords, there was a metallic scraping sound. The temperament transmitted through the Spirit Zone was like burning firewood with heat waves rising.

While the categories of physical enhancement possible through Schema were infinite, most people used proven builds since improper balance could cause serious side effects.

A build biased toward one aspect could ruin the body. For example, too much enhancement to the nervous system would cause muscles to rupture as they couldn't keep up with the speed of the nerves.

The build Lucas was currently using was the mitochondrial build, which enhanced the mitochondria—the energy factories of living organisms—to momentarily increase energy efficiency.

While it had the drawback of rapid stamina consumption, the effect of simultaneously boosting all aspects of the body was attractive, making it a build that most users basically started with.

'This could be dangerous...'

Iruki checked on Nade's condition. The way he looked at Lucas with cold eyes reminded him of that summer five years ago. The two had clashed on a day when rain was pouring down. The fact that Nade could smile now was close to a miracle. He probably would never show his old face again. The face that resembled the person he loved most in the world was what he hated most in the world.

"Be careful, Nade. That guy's a Schema user."

"I know. Let's increase our firepower and suppress him early."

Lucas found it ridiculous. "Be careful" was something you said when avoiding puddles or crossing a dangerous bridge, not when your neck was about to be separated by a blade.

"Hah. Kids these days..."

Lucas's figure became blurry as he scratched his head. Simultaneously, a golden flash was born between Nade and Iruki. The light of teleportation flashed, and the two appeared ten meters away from Lucas. Iruki checked his chest. His clothes had been cleanly cut, and blood was seeping from a line drawn across his chest.

"Are you okay?"

"It's not a fatal wound. But he's really fast."

Even if magic was a transcendent power, a magician's body was still human. Excluding magical effects, their ability to react and respond to a Schema swordsman's movements was inevitably inferior.

However, thinking about it in reverse, swordsmen were the same. The power of magic wasn't something that could be endured with Schema. Even student-level magic could be fatal if a direct hit was allowed.

Nade and Iruki concentrated their firepower. Chain explosions of Atomic Bombs connected like a snake, and Nade calculated Lucas's movement pattern to fire predictive shots. But they couldn't land a direct hit on movements completely different from the mechanical patterns they'd trained against at school.

'Damn! These little brats are pretty good!'

Lucas wasn't exactly comfortable either. Due to the characteristics of the mitochondrial build, his stamina was dropping by the second. When he maximized his metabolic rate, his speed jumped dramatically. After making a wide detour in an instant, he leaped from Iruki's flank and swung his twin swords. Nade, who had run from the opposite side, thrust both hands forward. Electric Shock magic struck his abdomen, and alternating current vibrations shook his body at sixty cycles per second.

"Iruki! Now!"

Iruki was already prepared. Gray smoke rose from the stunned Lucas's face. Watching the detonation reaction right before his eyes, Lucas desperately tried to move his body. His muscles felt carbonized, with no strength entering them.

'Damn! Damn!'

To face a life-threatening crisis against mere kids. No, was he really going to die? Faced with an unexpected situation, he felt like he was losing his grip on reality.

Iruki was certain it was over. Since the detonation reaction had occurred, it wasn't a hasty judgment. But suddenly the Spirit Zone disappeared. Before he could identify the cause, paralysis began from his legs. Someone else's shadow was already connected beneath his feet. He could tell without looking that it was Arin's handiwork.

'Damn it!'

Lucas desperately broke free from the alternating current vibration. Then he rushed at Nade, who had given him such humiliation. His anger, having reached the threshold of death, was at an all-time high, and his blade flashed with all his emotions.

"Nade! Run!"

Even while caught in the blade's path, Nade generated electricity in both hands. Lucas spread his twin swords and attempted a left-right combination strike. Just as the blades cut through the air and slashed down, unexpectedly thick ice pillars shot up on both sides of Nade.

Clang! The twin swords embedded in the ice. Lucas's pupils shook with shock. His swordsmanship could split rocks. Yet he had been blocked by mere ice, unable to cut through it.

Slowly turning around, Lucas's eyes caught sight of a familiar face. It was that teacher woman he had thrown off the cliff earlier.

"Miss Siena!"

Nade shouted with joy on his face. But Siena remained silent. With emotionless, dry eyes, she simply stared at Lucas.

"Hah. Hah."

Ethella's knees, leaning against a tree trunk, were bent as if they might collapse at any moment. She had been in a chase for a full thirty minutes. Even so, she couldn't completely shake off Arcane.

'The poison is spreading. I can't delay treatment any longer.'

Sitting down, Ethella tore the waist portion of her monk's robe. Black blood was flowing from a scar that crossed above her navel. It was a wound from Poison Cutter. She was preventing the poison from spreading through breathing techniques, but it was only a temporary measure. She needed to suck out the poison from the wound, but it was in a position her lips couldn't easily reach.

Ethella placed both hands behind her hips, grasped the tree trunk, and interlocked her fingers. As she lowered her head and bent her waist, a grinding sound came from her spine. When she stretched her spine with the erector spinae muscles, her hips lifted off the ground and her waist curved sharply. By coiling her body into a spiral shape, her lips finally reached below her navel.

Ethella pushed all the toxins that had permeated her body toward the wound. Then she filled her lungs with air and sucked hard on the wound. The moment the poison was drawn out, a burning pain assaulted her. Frowning, she lifted her head forcefully. When she spat the poison out of her mouth, black blood fell onto the grass. The grass immediately withered.

Vitality began to return to Ethella's face. Taking off her crooked glasses and throwing them to the ground, she wrapped the torn monk's robe around her fist and clenched it tightly.

"Phew. Now I can breathe."

As her wavering Spirit Zone regained its durability, the surrounding energy was transmitted through synesthesia. Opening her eyes wide, she kicked off the ground and flew up. Dozens of black hands rose from the ground like spilled ink.

'Already here...'

The fact that she could pursue a Zoner, an expert in reconnaissance, without rest proved how agile a Great Dark Magician could become when meeting darkness.

"So you've removed the poison. I like you more and more."

Arcane appeared, cutting through the curtain of darkness. But Ethella no longer needed to run.

"From now on, it won't be easy."

"Ready to get serious? Then I won't hold back and will enjoy this."

As Ethella put power into her fist, the true force of the Yin-Yang Wave Fist surged fully. Arcane quickly caught her change. She had completely abandoned her Spirit Zone.

Magicians handle the Spirit Zone, swordsmen handle Schema. But monks train both simultaneously. The reason for a monk's existence isn't to climb to high places, but to embrace the world with the broadest heart.

Arcane didn't like that. If she had focused on one field from the beginning, there wouldn't have been anyone on the continent who didn't know her name.

'How unfortunate. Why did someone with the talent to stand at the world's peak choose the path of spiritual cultivation? Well, saying such things to someone who doesn't even think of climbing would be a foolish question.'

Arcane extended his hand and chanted an incantation. For opponents who used Schema, he had a separate countermeasure.

"Servants of Darkness."

Countless spiders crawled out from the forest shadows. The sight of spiders the size of human heads swarming was enough to give anyone goosebumps.

Grrrrrrrrr!

But the true value of the Servants of Darkness was just beginning. A Dark Golem over three meters tall rose beside Arcane.

Its face was buried in its shoulders, and its torso and limbs were swollen as if wrapped in yarn. Its arms were long and legs were short.

Servants of Darkness was magic that commanded shadow minions, converting 100 percent of mental power into physical force. It was qualitatively different from the Power of Darkness, which absorbed energy from outside. While not immune to light like magical creatures, there was no stronger combat weapon than this in the night when the sun had set.

"Go, my servants."

The Dark Spiders opened fire first. With so many already tangled together, it was impossible to even determine how many were moving.

Ethella threw jabs in all directions, bouncing spiders away. Then she threw a straight punch at a cluster of spiders, and shadows scattered with a pop.

Graaaaaah!

Breaking through the scattering spiders, the Dark Golem charged in. The moment Ethella flew through the air like a flying squirrel, thick forearms struck the ground. The earth rippled like waves and finally exploded, unable to withstand the impact. At power rivaling the earth magic Eruption, Ethella's face turned pale. Since a Great Magician's entire mental power had been converted to physical force, its strength transcended imagination.

The golem, with both hands planted on the ground, twisted its head. Then, like swinging hammers, it drew arcs with both arms and attacked again.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Under the combination attack of swinging both fists like a windmill, Ethella retreated desperately. The Dark Golem was the ultimate weapon, possessing speed, flexibility, and destructive power.

Since she couldn't retreat forever, Ethella finally stomped the ground at the end of her retreat and faced the Dark Golem.

Graaaaaah!

Ethella leaped into the embrace of the Dark Golem rising like a wall and threw a punch at its side.

Pow!

The massive golem staggered. As equivalent exchange occurred, shock rushed into Arcane's mind.
