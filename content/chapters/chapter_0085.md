'Heh. Is this really a human's fist?'

A strike that could easily rival magic itself. Moreover, it wasn't ending with just a single blow. Ethella continued throwing punches while holding her breath. Each time she struck the heavy darkness, her wrists throbbed, but the shock her opponent received was several times greater.

Arcane gritted his teeth and steadied his mind. Ethella's punches were not only powerful, but the nature of their impact was unique. Rather than destroying the surface, they generated shockwaves inside. The problem was the interference created when these shockwaves overlapped.

'It's a wave-type technique. This is dangerous.'

Graaaaaah!

The moment the Dark Golem writhed in agony from the barrage, Ethella's eyes gleamed. Taking another step forward, she struck the golem's solar plexus with her palm, sending out massive ripples that created approximately 400 interference effects. This meant that a shockwave 400 times stronger than Ethella's regular punch had exploded inside.

As if it had swallowed a bomb, the golem shuddered and its black body began to swell irregularly. It looked ready to burst at any moment.

"Krrrrgh!"

Arcane grimaced as he maintained his mental focus. If his Spirit Zone broke, the Dark Golem would collapse. As the golem's trembling from wrestling with the shockwaves subsided, Ethella bit her lip.

'Was it still not enough? I should have overlapped a few more waves.'

The Yin-Yang Wave Fist was a martial art that used ripple waves, overlapping disturbances in the opponent's body before sending in a powerful wave to make them explode from within. It had the disadvantage of taking time to reach its peak, but once the final strike landed, the impact was devastating.

However, Arcane had endured it. The shock the Dark Golem received was equivalent to 400 times a Schema martial artist's single blow, but Arcane's mental strength as a Great Magician was not to be underestimated either.

"Not bad, little girl."

"The next one won't end so easily. You should give up now."

"Kekeke! So you still have energy left. How fortunate. I'll finally get to stretch properly after so long."

When Arcane raised his hand, all the Dark Spiders began merging into the Dark Golem's body. The gradually growing Dark Golem eventually broke through the ceiling of the underground cavern that had blocked the sky.

Ethella felt dizzy. The Dark Golem she was seeing now was the true identity of the infamy that had made Arcane clash with countless nations. It could finish off a small to medium-sized city within days.

"How's this? Magnificent, isn't it? Wave fist or whatever it is, you'll have to pound away diligently. The abyss of my golem is deeper than the sea, you see."

With a golem over 10 meters tall, it was questionable whether shockwaves could even spread through it. But Ethella clenched her fists so tightly they might crumble. She would become the light of the world. Even if death awaited, she had to move forward.

Graaaang!

The Dark Golem roared as it approached. Despite its increased size, its speed remained the same. The ability to move at the speed of thought was the primary reason the Power of Darkness was classified as overpowered.

Thoom!

The Dark Golem's fist struck down where Ethella had been standing. Seismic waves generated, toppling trees and churning the ground as if hundreds of moles were burrowing beneath.

Thoom! Thoom! Thoom!

Consecutive punches hammered down. Shockwaves shook the earth, devastating the surrounding area. At the moment of the sixth strike, Ethella changed direction and climbed up the golem's forearm. Racing to its shoulder, she crossed both arms and leaped down. Simultaneously with her fall, strikes too fast to see pummeled the golem.

Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat!

It was the Thousand-Hand Avalokitesvara Lightning Strike, the secret technique of the Yin-Yang Wave Fist.

"Krrrrgh!"

Sparks continuously burst in Arcane's brain. Over 30 impacts per second were flooding in. Estimating roughly 300 ripples per second, and assuming 2 seconds until landing, 600 ripples would spread. This alone would generate approximately 3,000 interference effects. But the true essence of the Yin-Yang Wave Fist lay in the final strike - the palm technique. If he allowed it to reach that point, what would happen? Considering all the properties of interference, refraction, and reflection, the number of interferences occurring after 2 seconds would be an astounding...

'68,000 times.'

A shock 68,000 times more amplified than Ethella's single blow would explode from within. Arcane's hair stood on end. But contrary to his emotions, the corners of his mouth were rising grotesquely.

"Kukuku! Now I finally feel like I'm back."

He had no intention of running. If the enemy was strong, he just needed to crush them with even greater force. How he had longed for this moment. The past glory of competing with countless geniuses flashed before his eyes like a panorama.

Graaaaaaah!

The Dark Golem twisted its waist like a pretzel. Ethella, who had reached the ground, also drew both hands to her sides. The energy of the Thunder Palm, the final form of the Thousand-Hand Avalokitesvara Lightning Strike, surged into her palms. As the Dark Golem's fist came spinning toward her, Ethella clenched her teeth and thrust both palms forward.

'Thunder Palm!'

Boooooooom!

A mushroom cloud rose from the mountainside.

All trees within a 20-meter radius were uprooted, transforming the lush forest into wasteland.

* * *

Stars twinkled in the night sky. Ethella blinked as starlight poured through the tree branches.

"......"

How much time had passed?

No, how far had she been thrown?

All the trees along her flight path were broken.

At the end of the trail of devastation, Ethella lay spread-eagled, unable to move a finger. Her muscles twitched involuntarily. She couldn't even feel sensation in her fingertips and toes.

'Master......'

Ethella was in a state of combat incapacity.

'Great Magicians really are strong.'

Even the secret technique of the Yin-Yang Wave Fist was insufficient to stop the Power of Darkness cast by a Great Magician.

Was this what magic approaching calamity was like?

Self-loathing for failing to destroy evil tormented her heart.

If only she had overlapped more waves, if only she had perfectly mastered the secrets of the Thousand-Hand Avalokitesvara, if only she had drawn out more power from the Thunder Palm.

"Huk. Huhuk......"

Ethella raised her trembling arm to cover her eyes. Hot tears flowed down like a waterfall.

"I'm sorry, Master."

Ethella's sobs echoed through the mountains.

**Group Portrait (1)**

Shirone and Canis maintained awareness of each other's positions even within the forest's complex terrain. Rather than fierce, they were cautious; rather than a firepower battle, it had the nature of psychological warfare. Given the contrasting properties of light and darkness, if the delicate balance broke, the tide of battle could shift in an instant. It was a matter of who would throw the first punch.

The one feeling more pressure was Canis. Due to the nature of dark magic, he was aiming for counters, but Shirone never showed an opening, creating tension through tactical movements alone. Harvest's thoughts came through their brainwave exchange.

- He's certainly skilled. Being able to remain this composed in combat isn't something just anyone can do.

- Should we pretend to be fooled and engage? We need to create variables. We can't keep being led around like this.

- Hmm. It's like a mirror chess situation.

The strategy of moving pieces in exactly the same way as the opponent doesn't create power gaps until the midgame. Then, when someone can't bear the pressure and makes a mistake, you immediately strike at the opening. But if the opponent maintains their pace to the end, you pay dearly for giving up the initiative.

'He's not showing the slightest sign of wavering. If this continues, we might be the ones in danger.'

Canis judged it advantageous to seize the initiative. He conveyed his intentions through the mental channel.

- Harv. What do you think?

- Hm? Oh, right. The longer this goes, the more disadvantageous it'll be for us. Let's go aggressive.

When the thoughts coming through the channel were slower than usual, Canis used Dark Port to create distance and asked.

- What's wrong?

- Nothing, I just felt seismic waves a moment ago. About 2 kilometers from here.

Harvest, whose vibration-sensing abilities were highly developed, could see, hear, and even taste through vibrations.

- Seismic waves?

- They're still being transmitted now. With this level of impact, it can only be Arcane. He probably cast the Power of Darkness.

- Master did? But the Power of Darkness is his trump card. What does this mean?

- There's a good interpretation and a bad one. The good news is that the old geezer is in excellent condition. The bad news is that even so, he encountered an opponent strong enough to make him use the Power of Darkness.

- A strong opponent... Is it Alpheas?

- For now, that's the reasonable assumption. Anyway, we need to move now. If Arcane found Alpheas, we should wrap things up here too.

- Got it. Let's begin.

Canis closed the distance. Contrary to expectations, Shirone also charged forward without backing down. Immediately catching the change in flow to maintain the initiative was an almost animal-like feedback.

Canis cast the Power of Darkness. The shadow's form was imbued with a mage's unique personality, and Canis's was a double-edged saw blade specialized for attack.

When Shirone fired Photon Cannons in rapid succession, the Power of Darkness was whittled away like a rock battered by storms. Light was certainly the natural enemy of darkness, but Canis stuck to dark magic. Though he could use basic magic from all schools, his opponents weren't at a level to be handled with minor techniques.

'Just endure. He can't maintain magic of this power level indefinitely. If I can hold out, the flow will definitely change.'

As Canis predicted, Shirone's mental fatigue was accumulating moment by moment. No matter how superior his attribute advantage, the defensive power of dark magic was not to be ignored.

'I need more power.'

Because photons are too active, loss is inevitable. Therefore, Shirone compressed photons faster than they were lost, increasing their mass. It was a method that consumed significant mental energy, but the power increased substantially, and the sphere of white light swayed chaotically as it grew in size.

Canis immediately detected the change.

- What's this?

- The power increased. I'll handle it.

Harvest, who blocked Canis's path, took a stance with force concentrated in his abdomen. When the massive Photon Cannon slammed into his stomach, he covered it with both hands and pressed down on the photons. But the photons wouldn't be crushed, and instead made a hollow sound as Harvest's body flew through the forest.

Canis's expression turned bewildered.

- Harv. You okay?

- More or less. Damn thing's heavy though. This is a murder weapon.

Shirone floated a Photon Cannon above his head. Then he created photons above both shoulders as well. A total of three Photon Cannons trembled with massive mass, and Harvest, as if he wouldn't be outdone in momentum, spread both arms and shouted.

"Kikikiki! How ticklish! Is this pathetic thing your ultimate technique?"

"No. That was just practice until now."

"......"

Harvest's voice cut off abruptly. As Photon Cannons twice as powerful as the first shot fired, the massive trees along the flash's path had their sides blown out. Canis's mental channel accelerated to its limit as Harvest's thoughts flowed in.

- Canis. Let's dodge this one.

- Once we start dodging, we'll lose the initiative. This is a fight we can't retreat from.

- I don't think I can block it!

- You can block it. Absorb my mental power.

- Damn it all! You're really a pain in the ass!

As he absorbed Canis's mental power, Harvest's body swelled enormously. His belly opened and transformed into a beast's maw-like shadow that roared toward the three beams of light.

"Kraaaaaaaah!"

Light struck darkness.

* * *

Creas was a warm southern city. And it was summer now. But atop the Unbridgeable Bridge, a snowstorm from the polar regions was raging.

Iruki and Nade pulled their collars tight. The blizzard obscured their vision, making Siena and Lucas's figures hazy.

"Ugh. It's freezing. What happened? Why did Teacher Siena cast magic?"

"Maybe she regained consciousness? She might have awakened when she fell from the cliff."
