"That doesn't seem right though? What kind of magic is this? This isn't like you, teacher. At this rate, everyone's going to freeze to death."

Nade was equally puzzled. There were hundreds of students here right now. He didn't think those who had lost their memories could last long in minus 20 degrees Celsius weather. But it was having an excellent effect of pressuring Lucas. When body cells cool down, the effectiveness of mitochondria build decreases.

"Damn it! This is driving me crazy!"

The place where Lucas was standing was especially harsh, with strong winds making the perceived temperature even lower. Necrosis was progressing from his peripheral nerves.

This was why high-level ice magic users typically laid down a blizzard before starting combat. While it wasn't particularly lethal, it was a wide-area spell that dealt fixed cold damage, making it essential against swordsmen.

"Anyway, mages are so annoying."

Lucas was fed up with mages who tormented swordsmen with all sorts of bizarre magic. But this wasn't the time to give up. More importantly, her condition wasn't normal.

When a sharp ice spear flew through the blizzard, Lucas hastily threw himself aside. However, with his mitochondria build weakened, he couldn't dodge completely and the spear grazed his side.

"Damn it!"

Most living organisms have reduced activity in low temperatures. Moreover, swinging his sword despite the cold had already caused erythematous frostbite symptoms on his fingertips.

'The temperature seems to have dropped even more. Is she really trying to kill everyone?'

If a Schema user was getting frostbite, the students should have already frozen to death. But in reality, only Lucas was trapped in the blizzard. The snowstorm, its radius having narrowed at some point, was following him with concentrated targeting.

Completely unaware of this fact, Lucas bared his teeth at Siena, who emerged cutting through the blizzard.

"Are you insane? How long are you going to keep up this damn blizzard..."

Lucas stopped speaking. Siena's eyes still contained nothing. No emotions, no thoughts, not even self-awareness.

"No way..."

Lucas's shoulders trembled violently. She was remembering magic with her body, not her mind.

Literally, muscle memory.

Just as swordsmen acquire techniques through endless repetitive training, Siena had reached a level where she could implement specific brainwave patterns even after losing her memory.

Repetition, and more repetition. She must have driven her mind to death without rest from birth until now.

'Just how much has this woman trained?'

His hair stood on end. Regardless of skill, the path of carnage she had walked was painted in his mind.

'Damn! This isn't just stepping in shit—this is way worse.'

He needed to escape now. No matter how much he loved gold coins, they were just metal scraps when faced with death.

Lucas drew out all his remaining strength and ran. If he could just escape the blizzard, she wouldn't be able to pursue him. But his thinking was mere delusion, and as a result, he had to pay the full price for showing his back to a certified 6th-grade mage.

When Siena raised her finger and pointed at Lucas, moments later Lucas screamed and was buried in the snow.

"Aaaahhhhh!"

There was no pain. But in his Schema's body diagram, his legs had disappeared as if cut with scissors. Lucas twisted his waist to look at his legs. His legs, frozen solid, had no sensation at all.

'Th-this can't be...'

It was Absolute Zero, which he had only heard about in rumors.

This was magic that extremely restricted particle activity through preservation condensation, which could be called the ultimate omniscience of ice magic.

Siena had risen to certified 6th-grade mage at the young age of 20 by achieving enlightenment in the realm of Absolute Zero.

But even she could only produce localized effects with this magic that required tremendous mental power.

'Damn it! They said this was some shabby school... but students and teachers alike are all monsters!'

Siena cast her next spell with an expressionless face. It was the advanced magic Glacier Bombing, derived from the omniscience of preservation condensation. As dozens of giant ice chunks formed in the sky, Lucas's face went pale. With his legs frozen, there was no way to dodge. He could only entrust his life to heaven's will.

Nade and Iruki rushed toward the students. While it wasn't area magic, the glaciers were so large they couldn't be at ease. As ice chunks freezing at different points slowly pushed against each other with their heavy mass, one almond-shaped glacier began falling toward the students.

Nade, who had run to Arin, grabbed her shoulder and knocked her to the ground.

"Kyaa! What are you doing!"

"Evacuate the students! Otherwise everyone will die!"

"No! There's not enough time!"

Iruki blocked the path in front of the two and shouted.

"I'll do it!"

"How?"

Iruki didn't even have time to answer as he gritted his teeth. Was it possible? It was a glacier weighing dozens of tons. Even if he blasted it with Atomic Bomb, the problem was the dozens of fragments it would split into. Judging by the glacier's size, unless it was broken into at least 1,000 pieces, crushing even one person's head would be no trouble at all.

'I have no choice but to try...'

Momentum could be predicted with mathematics. If he calculated all the physical forces needed to split the glacier, split it again, and split it once more, he could detonate it before it crashed down.

"Here I go!"

His departure-type Spirit Zone burrowed into the glacier's center. After going through the detonation process at maximum capacity, Atomic Bomb exploded, causing the glacier to shudder, crack, and separate into seven chunks.

Iruki activated Double Spirit Zone. Then he frantically fired Atomic Bombs in rapid succession to blast the glacier.

Bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-BOOM!

Ice flowers bloomed in full glory. The glacier exploded and separated into fragments, which then exploded again, scattering like fireworks.

Nade and Arin stared in amazement at the chain explosions happening in the sky. Then, realizing the ice pellets raining down, they turned their heads toward the students. Fragment as small as hailstones poured down, but not a single person was injured.

Arin's eyes shook with shock. Arcane had always looked down on magic school students. Weak students with no spirit of challenge or will to fight, who just took whatever was given to them. But the level of the magic school students she had directly experienced far exceeded expectations.

'So this is a magic school. Huh?'

Arin turned her head. Realizing she was being held against some strange man's chest, she roughly pushed Nade away and shouted.

"Get away! What are you doing!"

Nade's face flushed red as he fell on his bottom.

"What, me what! I went out of my way to help you!"

"Why would you help me! We're enemies!"

"Says who? Hurry up and release the mental domination! Are you really going to kill all these people? Are you still sane after this?"

Arin bit her lips hard. She would become the protagonist of a massacre that would be recorded in history after today, but she wasn't afraid. If she hadn't met Canis in Radum anyway, she would have fallen to the depths of misery.

"I don't care. For Canis's sake, even if the whole world dies."

Nade read the emptiness and arsenic in Arin's eyes. What kind of life had she lived to have such a gaze?

"Heave-ho."

Iruki carried the collapsed Siena on his back from the snow. Then he looked back at Lucas. Did even villains have gods watching over them? He was stuck between glaciers with just a few meters of narrow margin. But judging by how much evil he had committed, his jaw was dislocated and only the whites of his eyes were visible. Having lost both legs, thievery was now impossible. In the end, he was destined to return to Inferno's gloomy prison just seven days after his escape.

BOOM!

At the explosion that erupted from the forest, Nade and Iruki turned their heads. A thick beam of light was shooting up through the tree canopy.

"Wow. What's that huge thing?"

"It's Photon Cannon. He must have had some enlightenment."

The forest shook rustlingly, and Shirone came tumbling out as if ejected.

With his appearance like he had crawled out of a muddy field, color returned to Arin's face. Canis had definitely gained the upper hand.

But her expectation crumbled without exception.

As Harvest knocked down trees on both sides with its long arms, Canis came limping out. His condition was no better than Shirone's—if anything, it was worse.

Iruki spoke in disbelief.

"Even... match?"

"That's impossible. Shirone's Photon Cannon evolved during battle. But he still couldn't win?"

Shirone said as he pressed his hands against the ground to stand up.

"I can't win."

His friends doubted their own ears. Wasn't this perhaps the first time they had heard such words since meeting Shirone?

"What, man? Don't talk weak."

"It's not talking weak. That bastard... he's really strong."

Shirone honestly admitted it. If he had known the fact about being a Great Magician's disciple, it would have been even more convincing, but even without knowing, he could feel his will in each and every spell.

The will to not lose. The will to destroy humans. The will to prove that he was the best.

Despite maximizing the power of Photon Cannon, Harvest, borrowing Canis's mental strength, absorbed even that.

From then on, it was a brawl. They fought a flesh-cutting war of attrition with exchanges between Power of Darkness and Photon Cannon.

In the end, Canis succeeded in a counter and pushed Shirone out of the forest.

'Being that strong... why does he try to harm people?'

For whatever reason, if he had chosen evil, that could happen. All humans make mistakes.

But he couldn't accept that evil was strong. Because strength was the product of effort, not mistakes.

"Why are you committing such acts? What did the students do to you to make you do this?"

"Are you resorting to words because you're losing in power? The typical pattern of weak nobles."

Since it wasn't true, Shirone didn't get angry.

"Answer me. What you're trying to do now is horrible enough to be recorded in history. At least I should hear the reason."

"History? Who cares about such things? The abandoned ones just endure to live another day. If I don't kill someone, I'll die."

"Don't try to justify it with sophistry. Whatever life you've lived, there's no one in the world who doesn't suffer. Everyone lives carrying at least one unbearable pain."

"You. Have you ever eaten excrement that fell on the ground?"

Shirone closed his mouth. A cold wind blew.

'Canis...'

Arin's eyes were filled with sadness. Those who haven't lived in Radum absolutely don't know what kind of place Radum is.

That place was another world isolated from the world.

Canis and Arin had been abandoned there. They couldn't remember when they had been together or why it was the two of them.

They had simply been there since they became conscious, and while other friends died or were sold off, they survived.

Canis had been clever from a young age. Though he was a powerless child, he showed firsthand how strong a human could become when talent met venom.

In Radum, teeming with villains, Canis wanted only one thing.

To protect Arin for one more day.

Women don't exist in Radum. More precisely, women who have passed infancy.

In a place where food is extremely scarce, powerless girls are typically consumed immediately upon birth.

But Arin survived in Radum until she was ten years old.

The only woman in Radum.

The person who protected that eerie symbol was Canis.

He always barked like a mad dog. When enemies targeting Arin appeared, he would charge at them prepared to die.

He couldn't join any organization while taking care of Arin. So they barely survived day by day, digging through garbage cans.

The really funny thing was that even garbage had owners in Radum. They fought without hesitation, tearing flesh to obtain the filthy scraps others had thrown away.

After such fierce battles, Canis could barely obtain half a moldy piece of bread.
