Arin had been starving for three days. And as the price for Arin's three days of starvation, Canis had been unable to eat anything for twenty days.

'Gasp! Gasp! I did it! I got it! I got bread!'

Canis ran frantically through the alleyway. Only after shaking off his pursuers did he lean his back against a wall and exhale.

His consciousness was fading, and all he could feel was hunger. He couldn't even remember how long he had been starving anymore.

At that moment, a single piece of bread caught his eye.

Canis swallowed his saliva with eyes filled with madness.

He wanted to eat it. He wanted to put this in his mouth.

'Right, I need to keep my strength up so Arin can live too. It's okay to eat this much. Arin can hold out for a few more days.'

With that thought, it truly seemed like a brilliant idea.

Could there be anything more rational? First eat this, then use the remaining strength to find more food. That would work.

Canis opened his jaw and brought the bread to his mouth. The dried saliva flooded out like a torrent, and his hands trembled violently.

"Urgh!"

Canis squeezed his eyes shut and tucked the bread into his chest. It was all a lie. What strength could he possibly gain from such a measly piece of bread?

'I have to endure. It doesn't matter if my body breaks down. But if my mind collapses, it's over.'

Canis looked around like a madman. He was thinking of stuffing even stones into his stomach.

He crawled toward some excrement that someone had dumped at the mouth of the alley. And before any thought could enter his mind, he reached out his hand and shoved it into his mouth.

"Ugh! Ugh!"

His tongue, his mouth, his stomach, his entire body was rejecting it. But Canis swallowed it down.

It was better than stones.

Shit was better than stones.

After wrestling with his stomach for a long while, Canis returned to their hiding place with weak steps. His stomach still churned, but as soon as he saw Arin, he held out the bread with a bright expression.

"Arin, ta-da! I got this."

"Oh, really? Wow, that's amazing."

"Haha, I figured out the trick. I'll be able to get much more from now on. Hurry up and eat."

Arin looked at the bread with sorrowful eyes. She desperately wanted to go out and search for food together, but in Radum, going outside with a woman's body was suicide.

She had never spoken to anyone other than Canis. Thanks to that, she had developed social anxiety, but what did that matter? At least she hadn't become someone's food and ended up in their stomach.

"Canis, let's eat together."

"I'm fine. I picked up this and that while wandering around. Earlier I found a big centipede and got some nutrition from it. You can't eat stuff like that, so you should at least eat this."

"I can eat it too. How long are you going to treat me like a child?"

Canis grasped Arin's shoulder with gentle eyes.

"Arin, I know too. You're a brave kid. But you can't do that. Do you understand what I mean? The reason I can endure in this hellish Radum is because I can at least feed you like a human being. If you became like me, I might go insane. So hurry up and eat."

It was something she had heard dozens of times before. And whenever he spoke like this, Arin would always pretend to give in and bite into the bread.

But this time was different.

Arin looked at Canis's mouth with trembling eyes. Something was smeared there, and there was a smell.

"Canis, what... did you eat?"

Canis panicked like never before.

"Huh? Ahaha! This is cake. Some cream fell off so I licked it up, but I guess some got on me. Sorry for not mentioning it. I was so hungry...!"

Smack!

Canis's face whipped around sharply. He had been beaten countless times by the back-alley thugs, but this was the first slap in his life that hurt this much.

"Ah, Arin..."

Arin wore a terrifying expression that Canis had never seen before.

"You bastard... How could you do this to me! Am I livestock? Are you raising me like cattle? And then you tell me to eat this? What the hell am I to you!"

"Arin, that's not it! This is punishment for me! It has nothing to do with you!"

"I don't need any of it! I don't need this crap!"

Arin threw the bread away. Canis turned his head with an angry expression as he watched the bread roll across the dirt.

"Arin! What are you doing! Do you know how I got this...!"

Arin pulled Canis's face toward her and kissed him. Tears flowed from her eyes as she licked away what was on his lips.

It wasn't a sweet kiss. Nor was it a beautiful exchange of emotions between two humans. It was simply an act of two living beings, whose very birth was a sin, pitying each other.

Only then did Canis realize what he had eaten. For the first time in his life, tears flowed down his cheeks. The sorrow he had endured his entire life burst out all at once.

"Sob! Sob!"

"Don't ever do that again. If you do it one more time, I won't be able to stay by your side anymore."

"I'm sorry, Arin. Don't leave me. You're my only family. You're everything I live for."

"Yes. Let's live, Canis. We absolutely must live."

Overcome with sorrow, Canis couldn't even answer and just nodded repeatedly. But Arin didn't forgive him. Not until that day, when Canis had eaten every piece of the bread that had fallen on the ground.

Canis spoke of his past calmly, as if reciting someone else's life.

"We lived in hell. But our master saved us from that place. He gave us food, gave me the power to protect Arin, and even gave us Harvest, the essence of dark magic."

People's gazes turned to Harvest. Though usually a chatty magical creature, this time it maintained silence.

"I understand."

Shirone said.

"What kind of life you lived. But that doesn't justify killing people. Just because you lived harder than others doesn't make bad deeds right."

"Don't be mistaken. I'm not making excuses—I'm trying to teach you. How shallow the justice you believe in is, how hypocritical the world you live in is. What saved Arin and me wasn't that wonderful justice you speak of. I'm simply acting on what I believe in."

"You can't gain anything by harming people. If you don't try to understand the other person first, your past will never find comfort either."

"Heh! Comfort? You keep spouting nonsense to the very end. Shall I tell you the current situation? Our master is going to completely destroy this school. That includes your friends too."

"No. You can't hurt anyone. Except yourself."

When Shirone raised photons above his hand, Harvest spread his broad palm to shield Canis's front. But as if that wasn't enough, he extended his other arm as well to embrace Canis.

"What are you doing, Harvest? There's no need to be so scared."

"Dangerous. His nature is strange."

Canis snorted. He had already confirmed Shirone's abilities during their battle in the forest. He was decent material for a magic school student, but still just a hothouse flower at best.

"Hmph. Anyway, I have..."

Canis's expression went blank. The Photon Cannon floating above Shirone's palm was vibrating at a terrifying speed. It was even more enhanced than the Photon Cannon he had cast in the forest. But considering he was hiding his abilities, his injuries seemed too severe.

'How is this possible? With such ability...'

Canis and Harvest's analysis was mostly correct. But even they had overlooked one fact—that Shirone was an Unlocker who had opened the infinite realm.

"This is your last chance. Release the mental domination."

Canis frowned. The fact that he could no longer underestimate Shirone hurt his pride.

"Ridiculous. Even if I die, I follow our master's will. You cannot break my conviction."

Shirone's eyes turned cold. The power of the Photon Cannon enhanced by Immortal Function was on a completely different level from before.

He didn't want to kill anyone. But if Canis intended to harm the students, he had no choice either.

"Return everyone's memories. If you don't..."

The Photon Cannon exploded with light, then transformed into a blindingly cold sphere of white light.

"I'll have no choice but to hurt you."

Thad's forehead was already damp with cold sweat as he cast photonization magic on Alpheas's head. Viktor Arcane. An annoying human, but the power of the magic he had cast was beyond imagination.

'Phew. Such powerful mental domination. This would work even in today's era.'

At first, he had thought it would be easy. No matter how much he had received the title of Great Magician, a full forty years had passed. Magic had evolved several generations, and dark magic had become obsolete.

But Abyss Nova contained omniscience so complex that even Thad, a beneficiary of cutting-edge magic, couldn't analyze it.

After twenty minutes, he finally felt the energy of light penetrating to the core of darkness. From then on, Thad pushed the light with his utmost mental power. The veil of darkness lifted, and Alpheas's memories began to unfold brilliantly along the flow of light.

Forty years ago. The capital city Bashka.

The Kingdom of Tormia was swept by an unprecedented magic craze. The 12th King Adolf XII, unlike his predecessors who worshipped military might, was overflowing with intelligence and had a kind nature.

Upon ascending to the throne, he made the magic department, which had been limited to military affairs, independent and gathered countless talents.

Talents from the provinces and even foreign countries came to study in Bashka, and thanks to this, the capital's streets overflowed daily with voices of intellect.

It was a common sight to see fresh magic school graduates gathering in taverns from broad daylight to hold debates.

Gypsy-style clothing with bold primary colors was in fashion.

For women, hair short enough to reveal the neckline was a symbol of intelligence. In contrast, men's hair reached down to their waists.

Factions formed in taverns due to academic conflicts, and it wasn't uncommon for people to get dragged away by guards after engaging in hopeless fistfights.

The most famous tavern in Bashka was a folk-style pub called "Home of the Ancient Gods."

A massive hall with over 200 tables. People would constantly climb onto the central podium to expound their magical views.

All sorts of voices gathered, and the topics of discussion were diverse.

While magical debates were the main focus, "Home of the Ancient Gods" was also where gossip among the nobility was created in real-time.

It was an age of romance.

Alpheas remembered his golden youth that way.

"Oh my, kids! He's here, he's here! Lord Alpheas is coming!"

When a woman made a fuss at the tavern entrance, the women at the tables shrieked and turned toward the door.

"Hello, ladies! This place is bustling as always today!"

A beautiful young man with golden hair grown to his waist, Alpheas, entered the Home of the Ancient Gods. Beside him was a youth with a buzz cut that was completely unfashionable—Ozent Clump, Rian's grandfather.

Though there was no way the swordsman Clump had cast invisibility magic, the women treated him like an invisible man as they flocked to Alpheas.

"We've been waiting, Lord Alpheas! What magic will you teach us today?"

"First I need to wet my throat. My tongue stiffens quickly if it's not soaked in alcohol."

"Hehehe! How funny. Lord Alpheas is really entertaining."

Though his current students would probably jeer and call it lame, Alpheas of that time was a popular figure who could make anything work.

The son of a First-class family, a prodigy who had graduated at the top of his magic school class, and on top of that, handsome looks and sophistication—there probably wasn't a woman in the world who could dislike him.

On the other hand, men looked at Alpheas with displeasure. Even people who weren't petty enough to be jealous of others had unkind gazes when evaluating Alpheas, showing just how much public resentment he drew from men.

The light of the Mirhi family.

This was the official title referring to Alpheas at the time, but among those who knew him, he had a different nickname.

Arrogant Alpheas.
