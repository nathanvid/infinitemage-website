Anyone involved in the magical world could recognize that Alpheas was a human chosen by the gods. The problem was that he unleashed his talent regardless of time and place.

Once a debate started, he would see it through to the end, and if his opponent made even the slightest mistake, he would persistently dig in until he extracted acknowledgment.

Only Clump knew that there was no malice in Alpheas's actions. Rather than arrogant, he was pure. It was his excessive passion that made people tire of him.

In reality, Alpheas was someone who would readily admit his mistakes without holding grudges and congratulate his opponent's victory when he was wrong.

The only problem was that such cases were extremely rare.

Finding even the time waiting for beer tedious, Alpheas wandered around the tables mingling with people. Clump watched him worriedly, wondering if he would cause another incident, but now seemed to have given up trying to stop him, shaking his head in resignation.

"Saroph! Did you come for a drink in broad daylight?"

Saroph, whom Alpheas greeted with both hands raised, was a native of the capital and one of Alpheas's few rivals. Though he lost in every debate, the prevailing opinion was that if not for Alpheas, he would be the top prospect in the photon field. Naturally, Saroph's feelings couldn't be good, but Alpheas approached him without concern.

"Oh, right. Saroph, didn't you submit a paper to the royal palace this time? I read it briefly and it was quite interesting."

"What? Why would you read my paper?"

"Isn't it obvious? I'm also majoring in the photon field, and the royal librarian is my devoted follower. Anyway, it was a good read."

"R-really? How was it?"

Among the young magicians of that time, the highest honor was having one's paper recognized and working in the magic department under the Thunder Dragons.

Once a paper was accepted, they would provide not only a private research lab but also cover all research expenses, making it the most glorious position for a magician.

Having submitted his life's masterpiece just a week ago, Saroph couldn't help but be curious about his rival Alpheas's opinion.

"You captured the characteristics of light well. There was nothing to criticize. Honestly, the part about energy accumulation caught me off guard."

Saroph's expression brightened immediately. But Alpheas didn't let it pass this time either.

"However, there was one error. About light's wave nature. That's clearly a wrong theory."

"What are you talking about? Light being a wave is already a fact verified through experiments."

"That may be so, but I have a different view. Looking at recent experimental results, there are too many aspects that can't be explained by waves alone. Perhaps light might be closer to particles."

"Ha! Alpheas, now that you can't win properly, are you bringing up such gossip? Numerous critics have pointed out errors in the particle nature experimental process! If light were particles, how would you explain waves? They're completely different concepts!"

Whether light was particles or waves was the hottest issue of Alpheas's era. While the wave theory was mainstream, a minority of scholars constantly raised counterarguments, and Alpheas was one of those people.

"Are you the one believing what critics say? I've also seen materials claiming to have found errors in the particle nature experimental process. But they didn't approach it scientifically. Wouldn't that be the true error?"

Saroph, heated by alcohol, slammed the table and stood up. Already suffering from insomnia due to his paper, Alpheas was fanning the flames on a burning house.

"Enough! Who asked you to evaluate my paper? If you're so confident, why don't you write and submit something yourself! Let the world laugh at that ridiculous logic of yours!"

"I'm saying this out of concern. Even if it gets rejected now, you can reinforce it later, can't you? What's important isn't the paper but realizing the truth."

Saroph could no longer contain himself. What he really wanted to say was 'you failed this time,' wasn't it?

"Get lost! I won't even exchange words with you from now on!"

Alpheas clicked his tongue and returned to his table. Since he thought debates with rivals in the same field were beneficial to both parties, he didn't look particularly displeased.

But Clump was worried about such an Alpheas.

They first met at an inn in Bashka. Since Clump had also come up from Creas, the students studying abroad hit it off, and it had been a whole year since they started hanging out together.

Honestly speaking, he was unlucky. If even he, a swordsman, thought so, how much more would the competing magicians feel?

"Alpheas, what are you, a fighting cock? If others can't do something, just think 'that's how it is.' Why do you always step forward trying to fix things?"

"Where's the distinction between others and myself? Wrong things must be corrected. That's what intellect is."

"Good grief. Do you know what people call you? Arrogant Alpheas. That's your nickname these days."

"Hahaha! That's good! I like it much better than cringeworthy nicknames like 'Light of Mirhi.'"

Magic was a realm of talent, and Alpheas was endowed with overflowing talent. To him, who believed that talent inevitably shines no matter how much one tries to hide it, humility was nothing but pretense.

"This is also the fate of genius. Come on! Don't worry too much and let's just drink. Hey, Raphne. Pay close attention to the snacks. This friend eats more than a bear."

"Hohoho! If Lord Alpheas wishes it, I must provide as much as you want!"

The tavern employee Raphne's eyes were full of love. From the way she acted, this woman had also fallen for Alpheas. Clump's head throbbed at Alpheas's attitude of treating every woman like a lover.

It wasn't as if he was having any deep romances either. By superficially charming women, he had caused countless men to miss their opportunities. Even beyond magic, Alpheas was essentially a public enemy to the men here.

"Even Miss Raphne now? Just have a proper romance. What are you thinking, living like this?"

"Hehe, as you know, I'm everyone's lover. And I'm not exactly making moves on them. They all melt at my killer smile."

Alpheas touched his chin and smiled slyly. He certainly had the looks that would drive women crazy.

Would smiling like that really work? Clump, who had no luck with women, experimentally raised the corners of his mouth.

"How's this? Does this give me a killer smile too?"

"Oh, yes! That's really a killer smile! A murderer's smile. Puhahaha!"

"Do you want to die?"

"Hahaha! I'm kidding. Actually, it was quite nice. Make sure to wear that smile at the party later. Women will fall for you instantly."

"Party? Do I really have to go? I'm not even a magician."

Tonight, the Bastard family was hosting a party with the theme "Night of Young Magicians." Though it was a family with no particular connection to magic, at that time, hosting parties under various pretexts was one of the ways for nobles to establish their authority.

"Is there a law saying only magicians can come? People from all walks of society will gather, so you should make some connections too. Skills matter, but connections are also important."

"It's funny hearing that from you."

"What can I do? I have to climb high first to spread my aspirations. Anyway, you must follow me. Who knows, you might find your other half there."

Clump, full of enthusiasm for swordsmanship, had no interest in connections. But he couldn't help being tempted by the last remark.

As Alpheas said, who could know? Perhaps this country swordsman from the provinces would fall in love with a sophisticated city lady.

Suddenly feeling as if he had caught a cold, Clump kept clearing his throat.

"Ahem! Then shall we go take a look?"

* * *

The mansion of the Bastards, one of the wealthiest families in the capital, was gorgeous and magnificent, as if walking the boundary line of the law that no noble's building should be more luxurious than the royal palace.

Three hundred crystal chandeliers decorated the hall's ceiling, and marble tables with gold leaf decorations were lavishly set with delicacies from around the world.

Nobles danced with their partners to the musicians' performance, while elderly politicians on one side engaged in conversation over wine.

"Hello? I'm Clump from Ozent. Did you come alone?"

"Kyaak!"

Upon seeing Clump, the woman screamed and ran away. How could she not be startled when a petty thief-looking man was making a perverted smile? It was literally a murderer's smile. Clump froze in shock, and Alpheas burst into laughter, approaching to pat his back.

"Puhahaha! You actually did it because I told you to? Oh, my stomach."

"Damn! I'm an idiot for believing you. By the way, where were you that you're just coming now?"

"Beautiful ladies kept talking to me. I was over there being a conversation partner."

Clump looked where Alpheas pointed. Sophisticated city women were glancing at Alpheas and blushing.

"Damn it. Your back must be better looking than my front. They're all looking only at you."

"Haha! Don't mind it. Isn't that how it always is? Since we're here, let's eat until our stomachs burst."

There were many delicacies that couldn't be seen in the provinces, so Clump had been looking forward to it. Thinking that since he'd become a loner anyway, he might as well fill his stomach without minding the women's gazes, he headed to the table while Alpheas chuckled. He liked this simple but positive friend.

While Clump voraciously devoured food, Alpheas was sweating profusely dealing with nobles who visited every five minutes. Especially when even the head of the Bastard family personally came over, all the nobles looked at Alpheas.

"Nice to meet you. You must be the rising star, Alpheas."

"I'm honored to be recognized. What a wonderful party. Thank you for inviting me to such an occasion."

"Hehe! It's my pleasure to associate with young intellectuals. Let's see each other often from now on."

"Yes. If you just call me, I'll gladly attend."

"Good. Then enjoy yourself."

Though the conversation was brief, the fact that the head of the Bastard family had exchanged more than two words with a magician just starting his social life was a tremendous sign of favor.

Turning away satisfied, Alpheas made a dumbfounded expression seeing Clump stuffing meat into his mouth like crazy. He was definitely channeling his uncontrollable vigor into food.

"Doesn't your jaw ever get tired? Where does all that food go?"

Clump chewed meat while pointing to his biceps. Alpheas shook his head and turned around. Though he could feel numerous women's gazes, it was merely boring to him. As he trembled his lips looking for something interesting, a woman running between tables across the hall caught his attention.

"Hmm?"

His first thought was that she was definitely not a magician. She wore a simple dress rather than gypsy-style clothing, and above all, she rejected the short hair that was a symbol of intellect, letting her black hair flow down to her waist. Just watching her hop around with a plate in one hand and a fork in the other, she completely didn't match the atmosphere here that valued formality and dignity.

"Oh? That person. Isn't she the head's eldest daughter?"

Intrigued by Clump's words, Alpheas asked without taking his eyes off the woman, only slightly turning his head.

"The head's eldest daughter?"

"Did you come to the party without knowing such things? You really have no sense of courtesy."

"I don't know. Just explain it."

"Her name is Bastard Erina. She's 19 years old this year. She could be called the Bastard family's only troublemaker."

"Troublemaker? Haha, because she has a wild personality?"

"No. Her intelligence is somewhat lacking."

Only then did Alpheas look back at Clump. It was probably true. This bear-like friend he'd met in Bashka wasn't the type to make malicious jokes.
