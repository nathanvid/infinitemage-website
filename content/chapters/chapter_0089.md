"I heard he had an accident when he was young. That's why his mental age is around ten years old. They say he's not even allowed to leave his room, so how did he come to the party?"

Alpheas looked back at Erina with complex feelings. However, she paid no attention to others' gazes and was cheerfully greeting the young men with an innocent smile.

As was common at such balls, she too seemed to be looking for a partner. But not a single person gave her a kind smile. Rather, they were busy offering awkward expressions, giving her a brief greeting, and then avoiding her presence. Even that was only possible because of the Bastard family's influence.

Alpheas glanced at the family head sitting across the table. As expected, his face was flushed as he suppressed his anger. Unable to contain himself any longer, he shouted at his wife.

"Didn't I tell you not to bring Erina? Take her away right now!"

"Dear, please be patient. Erina likes parties too. If we try to drag her away and she causes a scene, it'll be embarrassing. If we just leave her alone, I'll take her away without anyone noticing."

"Ugh! This is so embarrassing. It's a disgrace to our family, a disgrace!"

Alpheas pursed his lower lip. He understood the feelings, but still, calling his own daughter a disgrace was too much. Of course, he knew well what position first-class nobles held in society. Alpheas himself had been born into a first-class family and had even earned the hair-raising nickname "Light of the Mirhi."

'It's just like looking at the old fogeys from my own house. Nobles, really.'

Alpheas didn't take his eyes off Erina until the music had changed three times. What he learned during that time was that she was purely enjoying the party. She seemed satisfied just by the fact that she had exchanged greetings with people.

But what kind of people were magicians? They were arrogant beings who considered ignorance evil. While they smiled in front of her, he could see them mocking the simple-minded Erina behind her back.

"Clump. Hold this for a moment. No, you drink it."

As Alpheas handed over his glass and turned toward the ballroom, Clump hurriedly called him back.

"What are you trying to do now? Please don't cause any trouble at a place like this."

"Those dimwits learned a few letters and now they're rejecting the lady's kindness. As Bashka's most popular person, I should step in and raise her standing a bit."

Clump's bear-like strength turned Alpheas around.

"Alpheas. That would be a bad thing to do. Erina might take pity as mockery. Those people are enough. Don't make her more miserable."

Clump was sincere. His usual dull eyes were gone, replaced by a righteous fire burning in his gaze. Alpheas smiled and patted Clump's shoulder.

"You're so simple-minded. Do you think I wouldn't know that? I've never treated any woman falsely. All evil comes from discrimination. Don't you know this saying? If you start being considerate, her life becomes that of a caged bird. I have a plan, so leave it to me."

"Are you serious? Are you really going to do it? Hey, listen!"

As Alpheas crossed the ballroom, he looked back at Clump and flashed the killer smile that everyone acknowledged.

"Don't worry. I'm everyone's lover."

When Alpheas arrived, no one was left around Erina. Everyone had subtly avoided the area. But it seemed to be routine for her, as she was happily eating an apple without even a trace of melancholy.

"Hello? What a delightful ball."

Erina stopped chewing her apple and blinked at Alpheas. Even before having a conversation, he could tell from her eyes alone that her intelligence was limited.

But she was pure.

So pure that he felt as if she reflected others' emotions like a mirror. Perhaps this was the real reason people avoided her, he thought.

"Ah! Hello! I'm Erina!"

Erina smiled brightly and greeted him as if she had just realized something. But her reaction was definitely different from when he had watched her from afar. There was a hint of fear in her demeanor.

'Well, this would be the first time someone approached her first.'

Alpheas politely bowed and greeted her.

"I am the magician Mirhi Alpheas. I was so entranced by your beautiful appearance that I'm only now greeting you. If it wouldn't be presumptuous, would you be my partner for tonight's ball?"

Erina stared blankly with her mouth agape. A piece of apple rolled and fell from her mouth. Anyone could see the emotion of 'What is this about?' written all over her face.

Suddenly Erina hung her head low. Then, without a word, she turned around and passed by Alpheas.

Alpheas was dumbfounded. In colloquial terms, he had been "rejected." Had he approached her too much by normal standards? Coming to his senses, he hurriedly rushed forward and blocked Erina's path.

"W-wait a moment. Was I too hasty? I'm sorry. I just wanted to become friends with you, Miss Erina."

Erina still didn't respond. She just stared at the ground while stamping her feet, looking for an escape route.

But this time, Alpheas didn't give up either. He blocked every path she tried to escape through and kept talking to her.

"Alright. If you don't want to dance, let's talk. Let's have a conversation. I'll tell you a very interesting story. Are you interested in constellations by any chance?"

"I want to go. I want to go to my room. Mom will scold me."

"Why would mom scold you? No one will scold you. You came to the party, and here I am asking to be your partner."

"They told me not to talk. They said people who talk to me are bad people. I want to go to my room."

Alpheas was frustrated. No, he was anxious. All the techniques he had used to win countless women's hearts disappeared, and all he could think about was wanting to make eye contact with Erina just once more.

"I'm absolutely not a bad person. Look, look at my face. How could this be the face of a bad person?"

Alpheas grabbed her shoulders with both hands. At the same time, Erina had a fit and screamed.

"Kyaaah! I don't like it!"

All the nobles in the hall turned to look at Erina. To anyone watching, it looked like Alpheas was doing something terrible.

"Mom! Help me! Mom!"

"Erina! Look at me! I'm not trying to hurt you!"

"Mom! Mom!"

Among the invited magicians was Alpheas's rival Saroph. Watching Alpheas's absurd behavior, he was incredulous. He knew the man was crazy, but he never imagined he could be this much of a lunatic.

"Not content with charming all the women in Bashka, now he's even harassing a simpleton? He's gone mad with ambition."

Most of the nobles had the same thought. Even if her intelligence was limited, she was still the eldest daughter of the Bastard family. If he could win her over, his future would be guaranteed.

The only person who knew Alpheas's true intentions was Clump, but even he gave up when things reached this point.

'Damn, you crazy bastard. You made this mess, so you clean it up.'

Erina was thrashing about almost like she was having a seizure. Any sane person would have let her go in front of her family, but Alpheas stubbornly held onto her shoulders.

"Erina, just wait a moment. Look at me. Look at me, I said."

"Mom! I'm scared, Mom!"

"Erina!"

When Alpheas shouted, Erina's movements suddenly stopped. But an even more fearful trembling was transmitted than before.

"Please just look at my face once. I'm begging you like this."

Erina slowly turned her head with a terror-stricken expression. She saw Alpheas's burning eyes. The hot energy seemed to be drawn in, heating even her heart.

"See? Nothing happened. I'm not a bad person. I won't do anything you don't like. But it's a party. Don't you want to dance?"

An unmistakable excitement appeared in Erina's expression. The particles of light breaking on crystals, the sound of the musicians' music, the sounds of countless people mingling and chattering. She simply wanted to laugh like other people.

"Miss Erina. I want to be with you. Please be my partner tonight."

There was no answer, but he didn't intend to listen anyway. Taking Erina's hand, Alpheas walked toward the center of the hall. She came tottering like a baby who had just learned to walk. And for the first time in her life, she was held in the arms of someone other than family.

When the quick-witted musicians resumed playing, Alpheas began to dance, leading Erina. The nobles looked stunned. Even Erina's parents watched speechlessly.

Alpheas didn't care. Because Erina didn't care. As if only the two of them existed, they gave themselves to the music. It was far from dignified dancing. But it was instinctive and passionate. They spun like tops, often losing their center and bumping into people. The more this happened, the louder Erina's laughter became. After about ten minutes had passed, Erina was finally able to become the star of the party.

* * *

Playful laughter echoed through the garden. Having practically caused chaos at the party before escaping, Alpheas and Erina ran frantically through the forest.

Reaching the top of the hill, Alpheas stuck out his tongue and gasped for breath. Humiliatingly, Erina didn't seem particularly tired. To think he had less stamina than a woman. Thinking he should cut back on drinking, he looked up at the sky.

It was a night when stars seemed ready to pour down endlessly.

Erina was surprisingly a person of few words. But wasn't Alpheas famous in Bashka for being talkative? He continued the conversation without rest, ensuring the atmosphere never had a chance to cool.

As time passed, he had the illusion that Erina was drawing out his stories. Whatever topic he brought up, she listened silently. When she occasionally smiled as if she understood, Alpheas became even more excited and poured out words like a waterfall.

Eventually, the conversation moved to the problem of photon identity that he had been pondering lately.

Is light a wave or a particle?

Saroph had defined it as a wave, but Alpheas was certain he was wrong. But that didn't mean he was advocating for particle nature either.

Honestly, he didn't know. He just thought that starting by admitting what he didn't know was all he had.

"It's really strange, isn't it? Light has truly peculiar properties. In interference experiments, wave nature is revealed, but on the other hand..."

Alpheas realized he had become too absorbed in his own story and stopped talking. In his excited chatter, he had even forgotten that his listener was Erina. She was crouched on the grass, looking down at the bottom of the hill. But the smile on her lips was still beautiful.

"Hahaha! Did I talk too much? I think this is the first time I've had such a long conversation. Usually people get tired of it."

"You are a good person."

It was the first words Erina had spoken. And Alpheas blinked as if he were hearing such words for the first time. He couldn't understand why his heartbeat suddenly quickened.

His mind was confused.

Why am I here? What exactly am I expecting from this woman?

It was an unknown world. A world where the desire to enter and the fear coexisted, making it impossible to judge anything.

Alpheas turned away. As if he hadn't heard her words, he continued the story he had been telling.

"Haha! It's embarrassing to say, but as a magician in name, I have to write a thesis, but honestly I don't understand anything. I don't know which direction to take. What do you think, Miss Erina? Is light a wave or a particle?"

Erina wasn't hurt by Alpheas's attitude. Rising from her seat, she looked at the stars floating in the sky and spoke.
