"Light is beauty."

"What? What did you say?"

Alpheas asked back. It was natural that he didn't know photonics, but this kind of answer was unexpected.

"Light is beautiful. Flowers are beautiful too. We are beautiful as well. But the light you speak of... doesn't sound beautiful."

Alpheas felt like he'd been hit in the head with a hammer. It was a direct hit of pure thought that couldn't be manipulated by language.

"I... I see. But why would light be beautiful?"

To Alpheas, light was simply photons. But Erina answered without hesitation, as if she knew everything.

"Because light shows us darkness. Without light, how could we see the night sky?"

The world became quiet. Like the universe itself.

Alpheas couldn't say anything. The thoughts he truly desired poured down over his head like a waterfall.

Why had he tried to distinguish between the two? If he just stepped back one step, he could see it so clearly.

Because it's beautiful.

Any contradiction ceases to be a contradiction.

"Beauty. It's so beautiful, Miss Erina."

Erina turned her head with a pure smile like a child. The moment Alpheas saw her smile, he made a decision.

To remember this moment for the rest of his life.

Alpheas knelt on one knee before Erina. Then, with the most respectful gesture, he extended his right hand.

"Please become my light."

That night 40 years ago.

The confession under the moonlight was a happy memory that Alpheas wouldn't trade for the entire world. A gentle smile crossed his lips as the curtain of Abyss Nova lifted.

**Reversed Master and Servant (1)**

Canis glared at the white radiance burning above Shirone's palm. It was an overwhelming presence indeed. Of course, he had the belligerence to charge toward death without hesitation. He just thought that even if he died, he should at least break even.

- Harvey. I'm for fighting. Let's go at it.

- That magic. How fast is it? We might not be able to dodge.

- You can just block it.

- If I can't block it, you die. If you die, I vanish too. We'll have to fight eventually, but there are too many variables.

Exchanging opinions at the speed of thought was an enormous advantage in battle. However, when opinions were split between extremes, there was also the disadvantage of not knowing what decision to make.

"What the hell happened here?"

What broke the tense standoff was an unexpected voice. Shadows flowed like water from the cliff, and a gaunt old man rose above the surface of darkness.

It was Great Magician Arcane.

Arcane's expression crumpled as he grasped the situation at a glance. The reason he'd been able to give his all against Ethella was his confidence that the situation here would already be resolved.

Arcane trusted Canis. No, more precisely, he trusted Harvest, who was subordinate to Canis.

But when he actually arrived, the situation was completely different from his expectations.

Lucas was collapsed in a miserable state, and Canis and Harvest were being intimidated by a single brat.

"I'm sorry, Master."

Arcane wasn't a magnanimous personality. Ignoring Canis's apology and turning away coldly, he glared at Shirone.

'I thought he looked familiar.'

He resembled Alpheas. Not so much in face or appearance, but in the overall temperament he felt. The spirit to speak his mind confidently even under a Great Magician's gaze was the same.

"You're the one who planned this whole thing?"

"Insolent brat. What's your name?"

"I don't want to tell my name to a murderer. Release the mental domination immediately and leave the school. If you don't, I won't let you get away with this."

"Heh heh heh."

Arcane burst into hearty laughter. He wasn't angry. But his criterion for killing someone wasn't anger, but how much fun he could have. In that sense, Shirone was a ripe fruit whose neck he could snap right away.

"Sorry, but I can't release the mental domination. Because Alpheas's disciples must die."

Feeling the killing intent, Shirone got goosebumps all over his body and unconsciously fired a Photon Cannon.

It was clearly a misfire.

Arcane lightly twisted his body to dodge the Photon Cannon. Only after confirming that the magic had dissipated did he turn back.

"Spirit Zone radius of 52.7 meters. Not bad. Quite a level for your age."

Even if it was photons, as long as it contained mass, its speed couldn't transcend the bounds of physics. But since photon output had a basic speed, it was much faster than ordinary projectiles. To dodge a Photon Cannon in an instant and even measure the Spirit Zone's radius was beyond human senses.

Shirone gritted his teeth and compressed photons again. He'd encountered a master whose capabilities he couldn't gauge, but to prevent hundreds of students from free-falling off the cliff, he had no choice but to fight.

"Stop it, Shirone."

Ethella walked out from the mountains. Her clothes were torn, exposing bare skin, and she was covered in dirt from head to toe.

"Don't rush into this recklessly. Arcane is a dangerous individual."

Arcane's brow furrowed. The battle with her had been enjoyable, but he'd long since erased from memory the food that had been trampled and dirtied.

"The loser has quite the thick skin. If you saved your life, you should cherish it."

Shirone's group was shocked. Could it be that Teacher Ethella had lost to this skeletal old man? Bishop of the Carsis Order. A Zoner who was an authority on Spirit Zone. A certified 6th-grade magician. None of the titles that described her were ones that could be earned carelessly.

"That's impossible. Teacher Ethella..."

Nade wondered if it could really be possible. Of course, there were 5th and 4th grades in the world, but he couldn't even imagine what kind of level it would be to be stronger than Ethella.

Shirone supported Ethella and asked.

"Are you alright, Teacher?"

"More or less. But it'll take time to recover."

"What happened? Who is that person? Why is he doing such things?"

"Viktor Arcane. A Great Magician who reached unofficial 3rd-grade 40 years ago."

The eyes of Shirone's group wavered. Any magic school student knew what position unofficial 3rd-grade held.

Magician grades were classified into 10 levels, but there were specific sections where the honor and achievement points needed for promotion jumped to unimaginably high levels.

Specifically, from 7th to 6th grade, and from 4th to 3rd grade.

If 6th grade was the executive level of magical society, 3rd grade was a position that could head the kingdom's core facilities. Considering that even Alpheas, a certified 4th-grade magician, was the principal of a private school, one could imagine how high a position Arcane had reached as a magician.

"Arcane holds a grudge against the headmaster. He won't back down until he achieves what he wants."

"Chatter, chatter, so much talk. Complaining to your disciple will only make you more miserable."

"I'm not interested in winning or losing. I'm a teacher. I'll do anything to protect my students."

"So? What can you do? Do you think you can stop me now when you couldn't win even going all out?"

"Your bluffing is excessive, Arcane."

Arcane's expression turned frightening.

"Certainly I couldn't stop you. But you don't have the mental strength left to focus on battle either, do you?"

Ethella's words were half right and half wrong. Indeed, Arcane's magical power after casting Power of Darkness was only one-tenth of his normal state. But it was one-tenth of a Great Magician's power. It was enough strength to sweep away the exhausted Ethella and these fluffy brats.

"Times have changed indeed. I was kind and indulgent, and now you don't know your place and flap your mouth?"

Arcane drew up his magical power. Though it was the one-tenth he'd saved to kill Alpheas, it didn't matter. Troublesome calculations like that didn't suit his philosophy of life.

"Master, please leave it to me."

Canis interjected. Abyss Nova was a massive magic that consumed such enormous mental strength that ordinary magicians couldn't even attempt it. If he'd cast such magic and even fought battles, no matter how much of a master he was, he wouldn't be in normal condition.

Arcane looked back at Canis with displeasure. Even if he was a disciple, challenging his authority was intolerable. But after thinking it over, he looked back at Shirone with an interested expression.

"Hey, brat. You're also Alpheas's disciple?"

"Don't dare speak the headmaster's name carelessly, you murderer."

"Kek kek kek! Is that so? You must respect him quite a lot."

Shirone didn't even feel the need to answer. How could he not respect him? Alpheas was the very person who opened his eyes to magic and the benefactor who enrolled him, a commoner, in magic school.

"I don't care if you're a Great Magician or 3rd grade. Compared to the headmaster, you're not even a magician."

"Bwahahaha! Bwahahahaha!"

Arcane burst into explosive laughter. But his eyes were burning with fury.

'Alpheas. How much hypocrisy have you lived with? Don't you know too? That you have no right to be respected by anyone.'

Having made his decision, Arcane nodded.

"Good. It should be fun to watch disciples fight. Canis. Fight that one."

"Yes. Thank you, Master."

Canis finally felt relieved. It was an opportunity to make up for all the mistakes he'd made so far. But Harvest thought differently.

- Canis. Think again. It's better to leave it to Arcane.

- What are you talking about? I've already disappointed Master. Now I have to beat Shirone even if I die.

Having their opinions clash when battle was imminent was never a good thing.

- Harvest. Answer me. Even you can't make me yield this time. We're fighting no matter what.

Harvest gave no answer to the end. Since this had never happened before, it was confusing. But with Arcane watching, he couldn't show a weak side.

Using Dark Port to instantly move to where Shirone was, Shirone cast Teleportation and flew out beyond the cliff. It was to prevent the aftermath from reaching the students as much as possible.

"Hmph! You want an aerial battle?"

The dark night sky wasn't an unfavorable field for Canis moving with Dark Port either.

Above the 1,000-meter precipice, the two engaged in flight reminiscent of hawks fighting, unleashing their respective firepower.

Shirone condensed 7 photons in front and fired them all at once. The Photon Cannon activated from the infinite realm had several times more power than before, but the recoil was tremendous as well.

Each time he cast magic, his consciousness momentarily faded. The infinite realm that threatened the opponent while also destroying one's own mental strength was definitely a double-edged sword.

"What on earth is that..."

Ethella stared blankly up at the sky. Photon output that generated shock waves was something even she was seeing for the first time.

The brilliant light streams of Photon Cannon split the night sky. It was like sweeping a golden pen across a black canvas.

Iruki and Nade were mesmerized by the beams of light. Indiscriminately firing such powerful Photon Cannons was like weaponizing the human being called Shirone.

"Amazing as always. But will he be okay like that?"

"We have no choice but to trust him. He did well during the presentation too."

"But it's different from then. Right now it's a life-or-death situation. He might unconsciously cross the line."

Ethella looked back at the two and asked.

"What do you mean? Are you saying Shirone has entered Immortal Function before?"

"Huh? Oh, well actually... these days it seems like he does it whenever he's bored."

Ethella sighed. Even after she'd warned him that he could lose his life, he didn't even pretend to be careful. Well, without that kind of passion, such rapid growth would have been impossible.
