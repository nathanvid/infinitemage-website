Canis had never been as flustered as he was now, dodging the flashes of the rampaging Photon Cannon. Why wasn't he getting tired? It was as if his mental power's limit had been severed.

- Harbi! At this rate, I'll be defeated!

No opinion was still being transmitted from Harvest. This had never happened before, making him feel ominous. Moreover, he couldn't understand the reason. Canis knew better than anyone that it wasn't a foolish magical creature that would maintain silence during battle just because it was in a bad mood over a difference of opinion.

- Harvest! Answer me!

A Photon Cannon grazed past Canis, who had strained his nerves on the mental channel. Though he hastily twisted his waist, it was clearly a delayed reaction. He hadn't dodged itâ€”it had simply missed hitting him.

"What?"

Over ten flashes shot out from Shirone. But this time too, the aim wasn't accurate. Canis finally realized. The countless flashes were annihilating all the darkness that could be used for Dark Port teleportation.

'This is insane...!'

If he couldn't hit, the strategy was to trap and beat him down. It made sense, but wasn't it too brutish? He had already fired over 200 shots of magic like Photon Cannon that severely drained mental power. Yet far from getting tired, the number of flashes was increasing even more.

'Just how vast is his mental power?'

At that thought, chills ran down his spine. When dozens of Photon Cannons filled Canis's field of vision, despair welled up in his heart. The bundle of flashes was coming in, blocking all routes that could be used for Dark Port teleportation.

'This can't be avoided. It's over.'

He felt frustrated and bitter. More than dying, he feared the fact that he had lost to a light magician in front of his master.

- How annoying. Arcane.

- Harbi?

For the first time since the aerial battle began, the mental channel opened. Harvest blocked Canis's path and took the Photon Cannon with his body. Under the continuously incoming shockwaves, the magical creature's entire body trembled as bizarre groans leaked out.

Thinking he couldn't absorb it with just his surface, Harvest opened his body wide and swallowed the Photon Cannon whole. His body lurched, then his panther-like slender waist inflated like a balloon. He began digesting the photons by operating his internal absorption power at full capacity. Then his body gradually contracted and returned to its original form.

"Gah...!"

Canis bent his upper body with a shocked expression. The reason Harvest had been able to absorb the Photon Cannon was because he had drawn upon his mental power. However, borrowing power unilaterally without permission was impossible under their master-servant contract.

- Harvest?

- Get yourself together and prepare!

Having drained all of Canis's mental power, Harvest flew toward Shirone and swung his claws. Shirone, unaccustomed to close combat, was cornered. Harvest's speed was agile enough to keep up with teleportation evasion movements. How could this be possible? He even seemed much stronger than Canis.

Ethella, who had the same thought as Shirone, looked back at Arcane. From his emotionless eyes watching the battle, she could understand the full story of the situation.

'Viktor Arcane. You really are a cruel person.'

The reason he had paired the supreme magical creature with Canis wasn't out of love for his student. To him, burning with revenge, a student was merely a consumable for achieving his will. A fuel tank that could maximize Harvest's power. That was Canis's reason for existence.

The faster Shirone increased the linking speed of his teleportation, the quicker Harvest's movements became. Canis's complexion turned pale as a corpse. With his mental power completely drained, he couldn't even think. Only emotions like betrayal and deprivation echoed in his head.

- Harvest. Why?

Only silence returned. Realizing who the true master was, the life in Canis's eyes began to die. All the events of the past flashed by like a revolving lantern as tears welled up.

Shirone fled to the ground. Blood was flowing from wounds cut as if sliced by a sword.

'Even Photon Cannon doesn't work. There's not much time left before Immortal Function closes.'

Canis, who had descended with Harvest, put his hand on the ground. His pupils were out of focus. Harvest paid no attention and charged at Shirone. He had to end the battle before Canis's mental power hit rock bottom.

While avoiding Harvest's blade-like sharp claw attacks, Shirone thought. The situation where he had gained the upper hand just moments ago had been reversed in an instant.

The reversal of master and servant.

The situation began to change as Harvest, who had been merely Canis's support, came to the forefront. A magical creature without fear of death. Could there be a more troublesome enemy on the battlefield? It was a combat weapon that moved by sucking life from the fuel tank called Canis.

'Combat weapon...?'

Shirone suddenly realized his mistake. He had failed to notice it until now, obscured by Harvest's intelligence. The meaning of the master-servant reversal was simple. The enemy had changed from a living being to an inanimate object. Then naturally, his magic should change accordingly.

Shirone, who completely revised his strategy, canceled Photon Cannon and cast photon output. The reason Photon Cannon was dangerous was its impact force that destroyed living organisms. However, physical force wasn't important to the lifeless Harvest. If he specialized in absorbing energy, then he could be annihilated with energy beyond his limit.

Photon output was pure magic and had no mass, making it more freely usable than Photon Cannon. Moreover, Immortal Function was still open. When Shirone's power, transmitted with 100% efficiency to the 300 hologram devices installed throughout the school, concentrated in one place, a beam large enough to cover a human body shot out.

"Graaahhh!"

Harvest was pushed back as if buried in light. Though it had no physical force, smoke was rising from his body made of dark matter. However, due to his immunity to light, the properties of photons couldn't help. Only the energy contained in the photons could wear him down.

'I need stronger energy.'

Shirone recalled the representative formula of photon theory: energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. Divine particles are omniscience that grants mass. Then it would also be possible to reverse the formula of photon theory and convert mass into energy.

He reconstructed the omniscience of photon output based on mass. When he combined this with the omnipotence of Immortal Function, mass began converting to energy in real time. The exhilaration felt when theory and reality matched perfectly was incomparable to anything, and Shirone, taking his first step into an unknown world, felt a thrill.

"Wh-what is that?"

The eyes of everyone watching the battle widened. The photon output began to narrow while emitting a blood-red light. They didn't know what kind of magic it was, but it was threatening just from the color alone.

Iruki recalled a story about some phenomenon of light that he had heard from his father, the leader of the Thunder Dragons.

"That... could it be a laser?"

"Laser? What's that?"

"It's a state where light energy is highly amplified. You could call it the ultimate evolution of the flash series? But how is that possible?"

A laser wasn't a matter of talent or effort, but brute force. One needed at least 10 years of mental rebound to gain enough brute force for photons to be amplified into a laser.

However, if approached mathematically, the story was different. Shirone, who had reconstructed photon theory based on divine particles, amplified energy through mass conversion rather than brute force. His unique omniscience had developed a new route.

"Kraaahhh!"

Harvest writhed in agony. The laser was extremely thin compared to photon output, but the concentrated energy transcended imagination. The color wasn't the problem from the beginning. What was truly dangerous was the invisible heat ray outside the red wavelength. The single-wavelength laser was generating enormous heat by vibrating molecules.

"Harvest!"

Canis grabbed his agonizing head and screamed. The massive shock striking his mind meant that in just 2 seconds, the energy had exceeded the limit that Harvest could absorb. This was the power of Shirone's new magic, Laser Pulse Cannon.

Harvest tried his best to digest the energy, but the molecular vibration speed was too fast. As his absorption reached saturation, his bulk swelled and finally inflated like a balloon.

Ethella observed Arcane's reaction. Seeing no change in expression even in this clearly losing situation made her feel uneasy.

"Canis! Stop and give up!"

What would be Harvest's next state after swelling so enormously? It might be annihilation, but it could be a much more terrible ending.

"Shut up! I'm going to fight!"

"You're being deceived by Arcane. Harvest is not your subordinate. Rather, you were Harvest's subordinate. Arcane was just using you."

Canis didn't answer. It would be a lie to say he felt nothing. From the time he heard that a magical creature, the final product of a Great Magician, would become his, he had thought on one hand that it might be so. He simply lacked the courage to face reality. If he admitted the truth, he would have nothing left.

"I will win! I'm not afraid of dying! I will never submit to the likes of you!"

When he came to his senses, the place where he was located was Radum, called the hell of the world. To Arcane, he was merely a consumable. To Harvest, whom he had thought of as a friend, he was nothing but a fuel tank. Now it didn't matter anymore. Only hatred for the world remained.

'Canis...'

Arin covered her mouth and shed tears. Canis had always been such a child. A pitiful child who could only torment himself for the people he loved.

"Master! Please save Canis! Please!"

She didn't even think of him as a master. Nevertheless, to save Canis, she swallowed her pride and begged. But Arcane only gave instructions to Harvest with cold eyes.

"End it here. Harvest."

Harvest, in an energy saturation state, couldn't respond. Trying to make sound through vibration would cause him to explode. And that was the result Arcane desired.

- Canis. Listen carefully.

- Harvest.

- Arcane intends to make me explode. Probably everyone here will be caught in the explosion. Then both you and I will be finished.

Arin released the mental domination on the students. Then, shedding tears and snot, she rushed at Arcane.

"Save Canis! If you don't, I'll never forgive you!"

"Arin!"

Canis raised his body and spoke.

"What are you doing to Master? Stop it right now."

"Canis! This person is doing this to us...!"

"Yes. Master rescued us from hell. He made it possible for us to escape from Radum. That's enough. I will fight to the end."

Were Canis's words sincere? But it didn't matter now. His anger was burning so intensely that even his own death felt refreshing.

"Yes! We'll all die together!"

Canis shouted toward the sky. Hot tears flowed down his cheeks. It had been a truly filthy life. But if that was his fate, he would meet a disgusting end until the very last moment.

"Kraaahhhhh!"

As molecules boiled up, giant bubbles churned on Harvest's body. Now anyone could see it. Arcane intended to blow up the entire school.

"Shirone! Stop! Harvest is going to explode!"

Shirone, who had been pouring out energy in a trance, heard Ethella's words and hastily stopped the output. But explosive reactions were already progressing in Harvest's body. His grotesquely twisting form predicted that secondary and tertiary explosions would occur.

"Hahahaha! Farewell! You must feel disgusted dying together with trash like me! This ends everything!"

- Canis. I'm sorry.

Canis's face hardened.

- I will release the master-servant contract.

Harvest absorbed all the remaining mental power and released the contract. Feeling the deprivation as if his soul was being pulled out, Canis collapsed to the floor with a shocked expression.

"Why, why... Harbi..."

Harvest flew up to the sky. How many seconds were left until explosion? 3 seconds? 2 seconds? In the process of running toward life's end, memories embedded in the form of vibrations came back to life. Harbi. Harbi. Harbi. Thinking that he could no longer hear the voice that called out constantly, he felt regretful.

'Hehe. Canis. That's your problem. You pretend to be strong for no reason.'

Since he had no life to begin with, he wasn't afraid of death. But he was worried. The sense of betrayal received through the mental channel still felt as vivid as if they were one body. But since he could no longer convey anything, Harvest simply hoped.

That Canis wouldn't be too hurt.

At an altitude of 2 kilometers above ground where his voice couldn't reach, the mouth of the shadowy face tore grotesquely.

"But it was fun, wasn't it? Canis."

Boooooooooom!

A massive explosion that destroyed the world's darkness occurred.
