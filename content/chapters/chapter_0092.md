"Your name is Harvest."

At Arcane's words, the black orb vibrated. As the molecular bonds loosened, the black substance rose like smoke. The monster born from darkness spoke in a murky voice.

"I am Harvest."

"I will conduct several tests. For the time being, remain inside the test tube."

Arcane pointed to a glass tube three meters high. It was so narrow that a human couldn't endure it for even ten minutes, but magical creatures had no concept of time's permanence.

That night, Canis and Arin infiltrated the laboratory. Since they didn't have Arcane's permission, they were visibly nervous. However, such emotions disappeared the moment they discovered Harvest.

A two-meter-tall humanoid shadow.

The dynamically broad shoulders contrasting with the slender waist stirred something in Canis's heart.

"This is Master's..."

The pinnacle of magical biology that the Great Magician had perfected over 150 years. Moreover, it was a magical creature that inherited Arcane's memories and possessed intelligence.

Unlike Canis, Arin trembled as if she had seen something grotesque.

"Ugh. It's really weird. I thought it would be similar to humans."

"If magical creatures didn't look scary, who would be afraid? In my opinion, this form is really amazing. It's so combative."

"Still, I think it's strange..."

Canis didn't care. If she didn't like it, that was actually better.

'Wait for me, Harvest. I'll become your master.'

Arcane had said he would choose Harvest's master between himself and Arin. Of course, Arin was a precious friend, but there could be no concessions in matters like this. Through fair competition, he would definitely prove his qualifications.

"Canis, let's go out now. Master might come."

"Huh? Oh, yeah."

Arin followed Canis, who turned off the lights and left. Then she flinched and looked back. Harvest's explosive emotions, vibrating, were transmitted to her.

"Oh my!"

Arin fled from the room and didn't come near the research lab after that day. However, having spent her childhood locked in Radum's warehouse, she couldn't just leave Harvest like this.

During the time when everyone was asleep, Arin mustered her courage and visited the research lab. Harvest was trapped in the glass tube just as before.

"Are you feeling very confined?"

When no answer came, Arin examined the glass tube's device, looking for a switch.

"If it's just for a moment, I could let you come outside."

"Why do you think I'm confined?"

Arin flinched and stepped back. It was a chilling voice that naturally induced fear.

"You've been trapped for a whole month."

"Being uncomfortable in an immobile state is human. I cannot perceive time. I wouldn't mind being trapped like this forever."

Arin tilted her head as if she couldn't believe it. The wavelengths she felt from Harvest were full of suppressed and stifled energy.

"...But perhaps, you might be right."

"Did something occur to you?"

"Well. Should I call it curiosity? That's not an appropriate expression. I was made to learn from the moment I existed. But now that's impossible."

"That's exactly what being confined means."

Harvest fell into thought. Was that truly so?

"How can you read my emotions?"

"Hehe. It somehow turned out this way. I lived in Radum for a long time, you see."

"Radum. The slums of Bashka, capital of Tormia. High-difficulty concealment facilities and extreme population fluctuation. Presumed to be a den of sub-races who lost territory on the continent."

Even Arin, who had lived in Radum, was hearing this for the first time.

"Harvest knows a lot."

"What information do you have?"

"Are you suggesting we have a conversation?"

"That's right. I have no choice but to converse. I don't yet have a master to share consciousness with."

Arin conversed with Harvest throughout the night. It was the first time she, who had to spend most of her childhood alone, had talked with someone like this.

After two months of experiments, Harvest finally gained freedom. Arcane opened the glass tube. But Harvest still didn't move.

"Come out. You will resonate with Canis. But you won't be bound by subordination constraints. I'll explain the reasons later."

Harvest gave no answer. It was unexpected for a magical creature with superhuman computational speed to be slow to react, so Arcane turned his head.

"Why? Is there something bothering you?"

"Why Canis?"

"Hmm. You don't like it? It's strange that you already have preferences without mental resonance."

"I understand that there's no merit in me being subordinate to you when I've inherited your memories. But Canis is stubborn and prideful. He doesn't seem likely to listen to my advice. Such tendencies would become weaknesses in battle."

"That's certainly true."

"On the other hand, Arin is different. She lived in Radum for ten years and couldn't meet anyone except Canis. As a reaction to that, her mental sensitivity is incredibly acute."

"Are you talking about her First Sight?"

First Sight was a unique brainwave pattern that perceived any object as if seeing it for the first time. Arin had grown up unable to see anything from childhood, and her brain had solidified in that state.

Therefore, she couldn't distinguish objects like ordinary people. However, she was absolute when it came to grasping the feelings contained in objects. Though there were many inconveniences, it was the ultimate talent for a mental-type magician.

Arcane also knew that Arin's talent was more special than Canis's.

"Arin won't do. That child's heart is too tender."

"I cannot understand. First Sight more than covers other shortcomings. With her, I could maximize my abilities."

Arcane smiled bitterly.

Even sharing the same memories, did different forms lead to different judgments?

"Perhaps your words might be more rational. But Arin won't do. You're going to Canis."

* * *

"Kek kek kek kek!"

The falling Harvest writhed.

"So that was it, Arcane."

Only at life's final moment could he realize it. The reason Arcane had given up on Arin, who had outstanding magical talent, and deliberately chose Canis.

'He was just as stubborn.'

Harvest's fall couldn't feel weight. That made it seem even more pathetic.

"Harvest!"

Canis ran to Harvest. Harvest's body, shrunken like thin paper, had holes punched through it in places, making it hard to bear looking at.

"Why! Why did you do that! I said I didn't mind dying! If you were going to do this, you shouldn't have betrayed me from the start! Why exactly!"

"Kek kek. How would I know? You're my master."

Canis seemed to realize something and clamped his mouth shut.

"Magical creatures, you see, just need to do what their master wants."

"Harvest..."

Canis's head dropped. He was so resentful and frustrated about living that he wanted to die instead. But at the same time, he wanted to live. How could he not want to live? That was what being human meant. Harvest seemed to know this. That's why he had severed the master-servant contract and decided to self-destruct.

"I'm sorry, Harvest. I..."

Harvest didn't mind. Magical creatures just need to do what their master wants. Since he was designed that way, even death wasn't shocking. Rather, he was more interested in Shirone's combat power, which had overwhelmed the combination play of himself and Canis.

'Hmm. He uses strange magic. But it wasn't simply being pushed back in magic.'

He was certainly a strong enemy. There was no hesitation in subduing opponents. Yet he wasn't a belligerent personality. Rather, his combat style that thoroughly pursued only results resembled that of a magical creature.

'The speed at which emotions are restored is incredibly fast. Probably superhuman insight. Because the time from problem to solution is too short, he appears unshakeable.'

Having finished his analysis, Harvest tore his lips into a grin. He was absolutely specialized in something. Though he didn't know what it was, it wasn't a trait commonly manifested in nature.

'Kek kek. Arcane, you're going to have quite a hard time.'

Arcane's expression wasn't good. Neither this guy nor that guy - there wasn't a single human who moved according to his will. Feeling disgusted with the current situation, he slowly moved his steps and spoke.

"Pathetic, Canis. Even if you bring shame to my face..."

"Shut up."

Shirone cut him off. His friends' eyes widened at the unusually aggressive language. On the other hand, Arcane turned his head as if finding it interesting. When something was too absurd, even anger wouldn't come.

"Kek kek kek! What a spirited child. How about this? I'll make you a proposal..."

"I told you to shut up. Can't you hear me?"

This time, even Arcane's face had to harden.

"I'm already desperately holding back. So shut up. Say one more word and I'll smash you to pieces."

Shirone's body glowed with a subtle red light. Laser. Its power had already been confirmed. If it could explode Harvest, who specialized in energy absorption, through energy overload, even a Great Magician could be vulnerable.

But the friends watching could only have their blood run cold. The opponent was a Great Magician who had commanded the world, while Shirone was merely a student. This kind of provocation was tantamount to suicide.

"What exactly is he trying to do? At this rate, won't something really happen?"

"No. It'll be fine."

Nade and Iruki simultaneously turned to look at Ethella.

"Teacher. What do you mean? Shouldn't we stop him right now?"

"It's a tricky situation for Arcane. He's at a disadvantage in terms of compatibility. If Shirone's magic just now was the type that concentrates energy, the current Arcane cannot block Shirone's magic. Since there's a possibility he could be defeated, he won't act based on emotions. Shirone knows this."

Nade looked back at Shirone again. Even if that were true, showing such boldness to a Great Magician was something only Shirone could do.

'He's really cunning.'

Arcane readily admitted it.

"Right. With your current state, you might be able to subdue me."

The surroundings instantly became quiet. It was hard to believe such words had come from a Great Magician's mouth. But it wasn't a thought born from servility. Rather, he was wearing a relaxed smile.

"Red wavelength. It seems to be based on the principle of vibrating particles, which could truly be called the natural enemy of dark magic. Moreover, I'm in a tired state, so it would be quite difficult to block you."

Arcane carefully observed Shirone's reaction.

"How about it? How does it feel to hear such words from a Great Magician?"

"What do you mean how about it? I told you not to speak, didn't I?"

"Magic is interesting, isn't it?"

Shirone furrowed his brow. He couldn't understand what Arcane wanted to say.

"That's what magic is like. It's neither fair nor has rules about how it should be. Because there are no limits, it's unpredictable. A meteor magician who could blow up an entire city might die at the hands of some trivial mercenary magician - that's the world of magic. Therefore, it wouldn't be too strange if I were defeated by you."

"So what are you trying to say? That you'll pay for your crimes?"

"You could interpret it that way, but..."

Black smoke rose from Arcane's body. The whites of his eyes showed and his expression was ghostly. Sharp killing intent exploded and spread in all directions like blades.

"You have to fight to know the outcome."

Shirone unconsciously stepped backward. Pure fighting spirit unrelated to skill or level. It was the aura of death that only one who had crossed countless lines of life and death could emit.

"No matter how good the compatibility, it's useless if you can't win. How about it? Will you face me?"

For the first time, Shirone's lips, which had been confident until now, maintained silence. Honestly, he didn't feel like fighting. Arcane's fighting spirit was that overwhelming.

'Indeed, a master is a master.'

He had persistently attacked weaknesses, then immediately switched tactics when they disappeared. He had no stubbornness. His thinking was fluid like water, and his vision was open in all directions. He could somewhat understand why Canis had been defeated.
