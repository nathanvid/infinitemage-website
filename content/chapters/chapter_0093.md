"Good judgment. It would be foolish to ignore nine things just because you obtained one out of ten. You must never stop thinking, no matter the situation. Everything in this world is determined by the amount of thought you put into it. Combat is no different."

"Don't be mistaken. I will never forgive you."

"Heh heh! If you have that kind of determination too, then you're perfect. Shall I guess? You're the type who grows in real combat. A school that only teaches rigid, formulaic things doesn't suit you. How about it? Won't you come with me? If you do, I'll make you into the greatest magician."

"Don't talk nonsense. The teachers here are far more respectable than a murderer like you."

"Then tell me. What have you learned here? Photon Cannon? Red waves? Or perhaps they gave you advice about Immortal Function?"

Shirone's eyes wavered slightly.

"How do you know that...?"

Arcane burst into loud laughter. This must be why he enjoyed teaching. He could gather ignorant children and spout whatever nonsense he pleased.

"Truly rare. Rare indeed. Is Immortal Function some ordinary level? But child, in places you don't know about, there are many terrifying monsters living. If you mingle joyfully with them..."

Arcane grinned, slightly squinting one eye.

"Even Unlockers aren't that rare."

Shirone swallowed dry saliva. Just how many life-and-death situations would one have to cross to be able to say that Unlockers weren't rare? Setting aside skill, this was someone whose accumulated experience was on a completely different level.

"I've met seven in a hundred years. Four were decent, and I killed three. The characteristic of Unlockers is their uniqueness. The possibilities of distortion are infinite. But untrained uniqueness tends to die before greater stability."

It was frustrating but undeniable. Individuality could become a variable that ignores objective power, but it was also a double-edged sword that could pathetically lose its strength when faced with orthodox methods.

"There's nothing for you to learn at a school that ignores individuality and only teaches the same things. You need to sharpen your own strengths keenly. I could do that for you."

"I'm not learning magic to defeat someone. Don't lump me in with humans like you."

Arcane read the conflict in Shirone's eyes. Of course. Without an obsessive desire for achievement in magic, he wouldn't have reached his current position.

"Right now you think everyone likes you. But humans are naturally favorable toward those who are outstanding. It's not because they particularly like you as a person. How long do you think you can maintain relationships with such hypocrites?"

Everyone included in Arcane's words frowned.

But Shirone just listened silently.

"Get stronger. So they can never ignore you forever. Otherwise, they will trample you. Even when such a situation arises, do you think you can avoid fighting with elegant excuses?"

Arcane held up three fingers.

"Three years. Within that time, I'll raise you to a level where no one on the continent can ignore you. Do you think three years is short? I don't think so. If we maximize your individuality, it's definitely not impossible."

At least for Shirone, it wasn't nonsense. As an Unlocker, there was almost no benefit for him to give up guidance from a Great Magician and remain at school. At best, it would make getting a job in magical society a bit easier?

"You're right."

Iruki and Nade's faces darkened.

"Shirone..."

If it was the truth, there was no need to deny it. Unlockers held a unique position in magical society, and there were limits to improving one's abilities through the standardized education of magic schools.

"Perhaps you might be right. But I still won't follow you. School isn't a place I need to fightâ€”it's a place where my life resides. Teachers, friends, a sense of belonging. I don't think you can give me such things."

Arcane frowned. He didn't know what schemes Alpheas had pulled, but his ability to brainwash students was truly admirable.

"You're being deceived. When you actually live life, such things don't matter. If you weren't strong, you would have been just another ordinary kid at school. Proving your strength is all there is to life."

"If that's really all there is, then why are you doing something like this?"

"What?"

"What do you have left now, having become a Great Magician through all that fighting? Everyone hates you. Aren't you actually lonely too? Since no one pays attention to you, you can only prove yourself this way."

Arcane's face reddened as he ground his teeth.

"You're spouting nonsense. The strong are meant to be lonely. It's because they're weak that they try to stick together. Look at the current situation. Everyone is kneeling at my feet. I dominate them. This is loneliness."

"No. You're just a murderer no one cares about."

At the word "murderer," madness swirled in Arcane's eyes.

"Hahaha! That might be so. But do you know? I too once had something called comrades. But he led everyone around him to ruin. That's the Alpheas you respect."

Shirone didn't believe it. He had heard from Ethella that the two men had a grudge relationship. The Alpheas he knew would never be someone to lead others to ruin.

"I don't know what happened in the past, but I won't listen to your words. Because you're a murderer. And because you're committing murder right now too."

"A murderer. Even if that Alpheas... is the same kind of murderer as me?"

Shirone's eyes widened. This time, he couldn't help but be shocked.

"That's a lie. What do you know about the headmaster?"

"Heh heh heh! Of course I know. That brat was my student."

"What... did you say?"

Shirone was at a loss for words. Alpheas had been a pioneer of light magic since his youth. So how could someone who used dark magic be his teacher?

Perhaps feeling the irony himself, Arcane looked up at the sky with distant eyes. The events of that day were still vivid as if they happened yesterday. As if something suddenly occurred to him, he stopped thinking and turned to look at Ethella.

"Did Alpheas get married?"

"No. He has remained single his entire life, devoting himself to education."

"I see."

Sadness briefly passed through Arcane's eyes. Though he had hated Alpheas for forty years, if there was one thing he could sympathize with, it was the matter of Erina.

"I don't know if you're aware, but Alpheas was married once."

Ethella tilted her head. As far as she knew, Alpheas was unmarried. Even if he had married and divorced, since it would have been a union between families, it should normally remain on record.

"But the headmaster is unmarried even in the official records."

"So he never received recognition in the end. Still, Alpheas was married. They lived together for three years. It was a woman named Erina. She was a wonderful woman. She shone brighter and was more beautiful than anyone."

"What exactly happened between you two? Is it something worth holding a grudge over for fifty years now?"

"At that time, Alpheas was a rising star who had gained recognition for his photon theory. You can imagine his status since he received the Gold Circle Award from the Emperor, right? His employment with the Thunder Dragons' magic department was confirmed, and he had set up house with a woman from the Bastard family, so he had nothing to envy in the world. But he had his worries too."

Arcane tapped his own head as he spoke.

"His wife Erina's intelligence was a bit lacking. She was at the level of a ten-year-old child."

"I see."

"But Alpheas didn't mind. He truly loved his wife. His love was never pity or pretense."

Arcane's memory traveled back in time. It was forty years ago from now. The time when Arcane ruled the world, and Alpheas, who had just entered the magical world, was called a supernova.

"This year's Gold Circle Award! Mirhi Alpheas!"

Fanfare echoed through the Grand Hall. Receiving the colorful confetti pouring from the ceiling, Alpheas shed tears of emotion. The Gold Circle Award, given to the magician who achieved the greatest accomplishment in a year. Once you won it, joining the Thunder Dragons was guaranteed, and you could receive support from countless noble families.

"Congratulations, Alpheas. I naturally thought you would win it."

"Please treat me well from now on. You won't forget your fellow alumni just because you've succeeded, will you?"

Countless magicians flocked around Alpheas. Since his stock would rise endlessly from now on, they wanted to make an impression early.

But there were certainly disapproving gazes as well. Particularly Saroph's face, who had competed for the award until the very end, was wrinkled as if he had eaten dung.

"Hmph. He succeeded by catching one retard. How can you beat the union of Mirhi and Bastard?"

"Exactly. Really, what a cunning friend. But what can we do, the results turned out this way. From now on, we'll have to be careful with our words around Alpheas too."

Saroph knew as well. Anyway, as long as he couldn't leave magical society, befriending Alpheas was the best policy.

"What will you do, Saroph? It'll be even stranger if we meet separately. How about subtly blending in now and asking for reconciliation?"

"No, I'm not in the mood for that. I'm fine, so why don't you go instead?"

"I feel the same way. Let's just do it later. Two would be better than one. Shall we go drink?"

"We should. I don't want to stay here any longer."

Saroph left the castle with his friends. Though Saroph had also been a final candidate who narrowly missed the Gold Circle Award, no one paid attention to the loser.

Clump burst into hearty laughter and dragged Alpheas out of the crowd. Just when Alpheas thought he could catch his breath, his face was soon caught in Clump's armpit and roughly shaken.

"Uhahaha! You bastard! You did it! My friend received the Gold Circle! I really can't believe it!"

"It hurts! I said it hurts!"

Though Alpheas screamed, Clump's celebration showed no signs of stopping.

"When you acted like a know-it-all smartass, I really wanted to punch you, but now I see you were actually a genius? You did it, man!"

Alpheas felt like his head would burst from dizziness, but he had no intention of escaping. The Gold Circle. If not today, when would he taste such thrilling pain?

"Now, now! It's a good day, so let's drink until our noses go crooked. I've made reservations at a bar, so just leave your brain behind and bring only your stomach."

Finally escaping from the headlock, Alpheas smiled apologetically and said:

"Ah, I can't go right away. Let me go somewhere quickly and come back."

"What? What fun is there in toasting without the guest of honor?"

"I want to go home. I want to put the medal on my wife."

Even Clump couldn't object to that. Though Erina had married a year ago, due to opposition from both families, they couldn't receive any support and were living in a small newlywed home in the commoner district.

The trigger was the Mirhi family. How could they approve when their son, whom they had even sent abroad to study, wanted to marry a stupid woman?

Then the Bastard family responded in kind. Even among first-class nobles, there was a clear difference between provincial and capital families, so their position was that even if their daughter was a bit lacking, they wouldn't be looked down upon.

In the end, Alpheas and Erina had no choice but to hold an unofficial wedding ceremony with only friends present.

"Right. There's your wife. How about bringing her along instead?"

"It's fine. What wife would like to see her husband playing around drunk? I'll just go quickly and come back."

"You rascal, you do have some sense. Then hurry back."

"I'll be right back. Go to the bar first!"

Alpheas escaped from the castle as if fleeing. Though his stamina was depleted from devoting himself to research day and night, today he didn't feel out of breath.

'I did it! I actually did it!'

He had won the most prestigious award in the kingdom. With this level of achievement, even the Mirhi family would have no choice but to accept him again, so having a proper wedding ceremony with Erina was no longer just a dream.

"Honey, I'm home."

Erina knew that today was the day the award winner would be decided. In other homes, they might have prepared a surprise party, but she came out from the kitchen just the same as yesterday.

"You're back? Have you eaten?"
