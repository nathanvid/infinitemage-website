Alpheas liked her that way. Even with the intelligence of a ten-year-old, her thinking wasn't necessarily that of a ten-year-old. Tears welled up in his eyes at her thoughtfulnessâ€”how she first considered the case where her husband might be heartbroken from failing to win an award.

"Honey, I..."

Alpheas pulled out the golden medal with trembling hands.

"I did it! I won it! The Gold Circle Award!"

Erina was always calm and composed, but this time even her crystal-clear eyes that seemed to contain the whole world couldn't help but waver. The day that Alpheas had talked about until his mouth was dry had truly come.

"Congratulations. I knew you would win."

"Erina, it's thanks to you. You accomplished all of this. Come here. Let me put it on you."

Alpheas thought that Erina was the true owner of the Gold Circle Award. Of course, the straightforward Clump didn't understand. He thought Alpheas was remarkable for deciphering Erina's true meaning rather than just her childlike words. But Alpheas knew. That small idea from Erina's mind would become the core code responsible for humanity's future.

"It's the award you received. Your thoughts amazed the world."

As Alpheas approached with pursed lips, Erina pulled back like a newlywed bride and said:

"We need to eat. Come quickly."

"Ah, sorry. Clump is throwing a party, so I think I need to go. I'll eat later."

"Oh, I see."

This time Erina couldn't hide her disappointment either. Then Alpheas grinned mischievously and lifted her up in his arms.

"That means we need to save time for eating."

"Kyaah!"

Alpheas bounded up the second-floor stairs with Erina in his arms.

"Wait! The bread will burn at this rate."

"Let it burn! Otherwise I'll be the one burning up!"

After Alpheas won the award, dozens of invitations flew in every day. They were all from distinguished nobility or institutions. Getting along with everyone means getting along with no one. By declining all but the necessary connections while raising his value, his reputation spread rapidly. As part of this strategy, today too Alpheas left home to attend a banquet hosted by the alchemy foundation. Since it was an institution that handled 40 percent of the magic materials distribution, it was absolutely unmissable.

But unaware of this fact, Saroph and his friends had been camping in front of Alpheas's house since before sunset. Their feelings as they waited for evening were nothing short of anxious.

Saroph sighed and said:

"Haah, this is humiliating."

"Is pride the problem? His value has risen way too much. Alpheas, I mean. He wasn't just someone who was good at magic. We should have anticipated this from the beginning."

Saroph was also full of regret. When the Gold Circle Award was announced, he should have somehow mixed into the crowd and resolved their grudge. Only a month had passed since the award, but Alpheas's reputation had risen to a terrifying degree. All of this was thanks to his excellent political acumen. Now that Alpheas was also selective about people, the gap for Saroph to squeeze through would only narrow further.

*Damn it. Trying not to bow my head, and now I'm about to kneel. Why does nothing go right?*

No matter how much he thought about it, there was no answer to be found. The only consolation, if it could be called that, was that having friends with him would make the embarrassment a little less.

"Let's go in slowly. I'll do the talking."

Saroph took the lead and knocked on Alpheas's front gate.

"Is Alpheas there? It's me, Saroph."

The person who opened the door was unexpectedly Erina.

"Who are you?"

"Ah, madam, you're here. You might not remember, but I'm Saroph, Alpheas's schoolmate. Is Alpheas home?"

"No. My husband went out. To the alchemy foundation."

They knew that a banquet was being held at the alchemy foundation. But since it wasn't a drinking party, it wouldn't take long. Thinking it was actually better this way, Saroph said politely:

"I see. If it's not too much trouble, could we come in and wait? There are people watching and all..."

It was already embarrassing to come to his house, but lurking in front of the door would surely lead to gossip.

"Yes, please come in."

Saroph sat in the living room with his friends, nervously rubbing his hands. Perhaps feeling sorry for them, Erina called them to the dining table and served snacks and alcohol.

"Please have something to eat. My husband will eat there and come back."

"Thank you. You're truly kind."

Considerably embarrassed, Saroph regretted not bringing a gift. He had bought something just in case, but when he actually tried to bring it, his stomach turned and he couldn't bear it.

It wasn't that he was inferior in skill. No matter how much Alpheas and Erina's families had cut ties, there was still the reputation of First-class status, and Saroph thought it must have influenced the evaluation to some degree.

Thinking such thoughts while drinking, he quickly became intoxicated. At first he endured while being tense, but from the moment he felt Erina's intellectual level firsthand, his guard unknowingly dropped.

"You know what! I was once called a genius too, if I do say so myself. Me, yes me!"

"Who says you weren't? The world is so unfair! People who work hard suffer death, while someone somewhere gets ahead by pulling strings! Magic is already dead!"

At his friend's words, one of Saroph's eyebrows shot up. The person his friend was targeting was none other than Alpheas. But he let it slide. Erina wouldn't understand what they were talking about anyway. Suddenly the alcohol tasted sweet. Perhaps this was the first time he had beaten Alpheas? To be able to criticize him so loudly in front of his wife.

*Hmph, that bastard humiliated me so much. This much is nothing, nothing.*

Saroph went a step further and addressed Erina:

"Don't you think so, sister-in-law? Magic, you see, isn't something that works with skill alone. You agree, don't you?"

"Yes, I don't really know."

"Hahaha! Of course. You wouldn't know. But it's true. Everything I'm saying is true."

Saroph tasted the pleasure of victory. He had not only criticized Alpheas but also mocked his wife. His friends, catching Saroph's intent, joined in by pounding the table.

"Sister-in-law, since the mood is like this, why don't you sing us a song?"

"That's right! Let's celebrate Alpheas's success and have you sing a song."

Erina's smile hardened. People think that if your intelligence is low, you won't understand anything. But reading others' emotions was always the role of the weak. Erina also knew that Saroph's group was not well-intentioned. Even so, she was trying to accommodate them because they were her husband's friends.

"When the wheat ripens in my hometown where I live..."

As Erina began to sing, Saroph's group clapped and whistled. Even amidst this, she continued the song steadfastly with a trembling voice.

But before she could even finish three verses, a cold voice came from the living room:

"What are you doing right now?"

Everyone turned their heads without exception. Alpheas stood there with a reddened face, fists clenched. Saroph sobered up instantly. As his mind returned, he finally realized what he had been doing.

"S-sorry. We seem to have had too much to drink."

"You bastard!"

Alpheas strode over and swung his fist. Saroph, hit squarely in the face, rolled on the floor. Then his friends jumped up and shouted:

"Alpheas! What kind of violent behavior is this! No matter how angry you are...!"

"No, enough. Stop it."

Saroph raised his hand to stop his friends. He was ashamed of himself. Was this all I amounted to? Just a loser who found consolation in harassing his rival's wife?

"Get out, before I kill you. Get out of this house right now!"

"I'm sorry about today. I won't come looking for you anymore."

Saroph and his friends were thrown out of Alpheas's house. Silence settled over the living room after the unwelcome guests left. Alpheas couldn't contain his surging anger. He knew why they had made Erina sing.

"What happened? Why were those bastards here?"

Erina was too frightened to say anything. This was the first time her husband had been this angry.

"Speak! Why did you let those bastards in!"

"I'm sorry. Since they were your friends, I thought you'd be happy..."

"What are you talking about? Why would trash like that be my friends? Can't you distinguish between real friends and fake ones? And then you're just sitting there singing? You really are an idiot!"

Alpheas turned away roughly. His face, with head bowed, was distorted with regret. Words that should never be used, words he had vowed never to use, had burst out of his mouth.

*Damn trash. I'm not even human.*

He wanted to turn back time, but it was already too late. No, even if he could turn it back, he might have said the same thing. He was going crazy from being unable to suppress his anger.

"Forget what I just said. I made a mistake."

"Honey, I was wrong. I won't do it again."

Erina's words hurt his heart even more. She wasn't the one who should apologize. But then, where exactly should I throw this resentment?

"I'm going to get some air. It'll get better with time. I'm sorry. Go to bed first tonight."

Alpheas left the house. That was the only way to handle the current situation rationally.

He went to the inn where Clump was staying and drank all night. He couldn't get drunk. The more intoxicated he became, the more Saroph faded from memory and only the wounds Erina must have received came to mind.

"Damn it. I'm trash. I don't deserve to be a husband. She followed me trusting only in me. How could I speak to her that way?"

Clump wore a pitiful expression. Being a man himself, he could understand Alpheas's anger. But even so, he still thought a mistake had been made.

"They say marital fights are like cutting water with a knife. Now your future is bright, and all the bad times have passed. Couldn't today be an opportunity to become even closer?"

When Alpheas remained silent, Clump brought up something he'd been thinking about:

"Instead of this, how about having a child?"

Alpheas's eyes sparkled for a moment. But soon he shook his head with a gloomy expression.

Clump, guessing something, raised his eyes in surprise:

"What, you, don't tell me? You still haven't even once..."

"What nonsense are you talking? We're married. No matter how young Erina is, she knows what she needs to know."

"Tch, who said anything? Maybe you're the impotent one, not your wife. You're so scrawny and all. Kekeke."

Not in the mood to laugh, Alpheas stared at his drink and bitterly gulped it down.

Clump sighed and said:

"Geez. Then what exactly is the problem? Just have a kid and live happily together."

"Erina... I don't know if she can give birth."

"Why? Is there something wrong with her health?"

"No. It's just that, you know. Childbirth is terrible pain, and I don't know if Erina can endure it. There's also the childcare issue."

Clump sighed as he pondered Alpheas's words. Ultimately, it was a question of whether a woman with ten-year-old intelligence could endure labor pains. Intelligence was a great force that controlled humans. There was a world of difference between suffering pain while knowing and suffering it unknowingly.

"Alpheas, it's a bit awkward to say this, but you knew from when you were considering marriage..."

"Yeah, I know. I'm not regretting it. No, I truly don't regret it. I can't live without Erina. Without her, no glory would have any meaning."

Clump gulped down two drinks in succession. If he was frustrated, how much more so must the person involved be?

"So what are you planning to do? Just sitting here complaining isn't like you. Why is a smart guy acting like this?"

Alpheas fell into thought while spinning his glass around and around. At some point, his eyes, resisting the intoxication, sparkled brilliantly with intelligence.
