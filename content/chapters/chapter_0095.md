Arcane knew that someone had infiltrated his dungeon the night before. But he didn't care. There were countless people who entered the Great Magician's dungeon seeking treasure. By now, they would have turned into corpses after falling victim to monsters or traps.

Arcane dismissed the lingering thought and refocused on his research. Lately, the field he was delving into was the influence of dark magic on memory. His hand, which had been frantically writing his thesis, suddenly stopped. He removed his glasses and looked toward the door. The mechanisms were being disabled at a rapid pace. This was no ordinary person.

"Has a big fish finally taken the bait after so long?"

For Arcane, who would shut himself away for years at a time, dungeon intruders were good entertainment. Moreover, today it seemed a fairly decent human had taken the bait.

With a thud, the iron door opened, and Arcane checked his watch. Exactly 32 hours, 28 minutes, and 5 seconds. That was the time it had taken to dismantle the mechanisms and reach this place from the entrance.

"Great Magician... are you Viktor Arcane?"

It was a bloodied man. He was handsome, and his eyes gleamed with intelligence.

"You don't look like someone who would covet money. Who are you?"

"I am Mirhi Alpheas. I had no other way to meet you, so I came here directly."

"Oh?"

Arcane's eyebrows rose. Just because he was holed up in a dungeon didn't mean he ignored outside affairs. Through secret routes, he had already learned about Alpheas's photon theory.

"A light magician coming to see a dark magician. How peculiar indeed. Sit down first. I'll treat you."

Arcane activated the life support device. As soon as Alpheas entered the hemispherical device filled with green liquid, he fell into a deep sleep upon being submerged.

Three hours later.

"Puha! Haak!"

Alpheas lifted his torso above the water's surface. He had almost suffocated if he wasn't careful. But how could he have fallen asleep? With this question in mind, he turned his head to see Arcane sitting at his desk, writing a thesis. He had such a scholarly demeanor that it was hard to believe he was the Great Magician who had thrown the continent into chaos.

"Thank you for the treatment. That's a good device. I'm curious about the principle."

"Don't beat around the bush. That doesn't change the fact that you're an uninvited guest. Tell me why you came to find me."

If he was someone driven by curiosity and interest, there would be no need to waste time.

Alpheas got straight to the point.

"I want to learn dark magic. Please accept me as your disciple."

"Oh?"

The currently hottest topic, Alpheas, was asking to become a disciple. Even someone like Arcane couldn't help but be intrigued by such words.

"Do you have a special reason?"

"I have a wife. But her intellectual abilities are lacking. I heard rumors that you research storing memories in dark magic. I want to give my memories to my wife."

Arcane's eyes flashed. Since they both knew each other's specialties thoroughly, long explanations weren't necessary.

"I've done quite a bit of research on memory manipulation. But what you're asking for is on a different level. There's the matter of personality, and above all, it's the task of transferring an entire person's lifetime wholesale."

"I believe it's possible. If we combine dark magic's absorptive nature with photons' information transmission ability, couldn't we implement virtual intelligence?"

"Hmm, construct a nervous system with photon magic and grant memories to it?"

It was certainly a novel idea. Until now, photon magic had been so limited in utility that it could be called time magic, but Arcane predicted that with photon theory revealed, it would distinguish itself in the information field going forward.

"Before examining the theory, there's one point I'm curious about. Has your wife consented to the experiment?"

"She doesn't know yet. But she will definitely agree."

"There must be a story behind this."

Alpheas revealed the circumstances that led him to come this far. After hearing the story, Arcane understood his feelings. Moreover, the proposal was definitely ingenious. For the next day, the two men examined the possibilities. When they reached an agreement on the theoretical foundation, Arcane also agreed that it wasn't a vain delusion.

"Good. If you're truly prepared to stake your life on this, I'll accept you as my disciple. But convincing your family won't be easy."

Though he would become a Great Magician's disciple, Alpheas was also the scion of a prestigious family. Arcane thought it unlikely that he would throw away his guaranteed future employment in the Thunder Dragons' magic department to enter a dim research laboratory.

But Alpheas hadn't considered any other path. If Erina was unhappy, he was unhappy too. He only wished for Erina's happiness.

"Thank you. I'll come with my family soon."

Returning home, Alpheas consulted with Erina. Since it was a life-changing matter, Clump was also seated at the meeting. The point Alpheas emphasized was that Erina's intellectual disability could be cured. And Clump opposed it as soon as he finished speaking.

"Alpheas, what are you talking about? Why would you seek out such a person? He's a criminal, isn't he?"

"Such things aren't important to a magician. What's really important is that he understands dark magic best on the continent. He's also knowledgeable about human memory and brain structure. It won't be a losing proposition."

"No, it is a loss. You're bewitched by something right now. Implanting memories in a human brain? That can't be possible!"

"Clump, the reason you think that way is..."

"Yes! I'm stupid! I'm not as smart as you, nor am I a genius! But even someone like me knows one thing. You're kicking away good fortune that's rolled your way. If you associate with such a person, your entry into the Thunder Dragons will be canceled too. What about the family? Your family will really abandon you!"

Alpheas couldn't be unaware of this fact. But it was a conclusion he had reached after countless deliberations.

"I don't care. Such things can't determine my life. I don't need the Thunder Dragons or the family. As long as Erina can be happy, I can be much happier than I am now."

Erina pondered. But the decision had already been made with Alpheas's last words. If her husband was happy, Erina could be happy too.

"Honey, I'll do it."

"Sister-in-law! This is something that needs to be thought through."

"I'm going to do it. Because I trust my husband. Alpheas will make me happy."

"Well, of course! Who am I? I'm a magician who received the Gold Circle. And my master is a Great Magician. If we join hands, we can easily fix your weaknesses."

Clump came every day to persuade Alpheas, but he couldn't break the couple's determination. Eventually, Alpheas settled all his affairs and entered Arcane's dungeon with Erina.

"Welcome. I'm Viktor Arcane."

"Hello. My husband has been in your care."

Erina greeted him respectfully. From now on, he was her husband's master, so she couldn't act carelessly.

But Arcane comforted her as if he didn't mind.

"Don't worry too much. I may look like this, but I've devoted myself to this field for decades. You've made a big decision. If we succeed, we can cure countless mental patients. Your husband will also gain fame incomparable to what he would have had at the Thunder Dragons."

He would become a Great Magician's disciple. Moreover, if they could recover everything her husband had given up as a reward for success, Erina thought it was worth trying.

For the next two years, Alpheas resided in the dungeon and conducted research on transferring memories to his wife. Arcane was an expert in experiments, enough to operate a personal dungeon. Under his rational care, Erina could also stay in the dungeon without any particular discomfort.

"Hey there, sister-in-law. How are things?"

Once a week, Clump would visit bringing food. Even if the two people busy with experiments could manage, they couldn't let Erina eat bitter food, could they?

"I'm fine. The experiment will end soon. Then my husband can return to the world again."

Clump burst into hearty laughter. She must have had a hard time with various tests for two years, yet she endured so well. That's why it was bittersweet in a way. What did it matter if her intelligence was a bit lacking? Her heart sacrificing for her husband was never inferior.

At the news that Clump had arrived, Alpheas came to find him. As Erina had said, he seemed to be pushing harder than ever, as his face appeared more gaunt each time he visited.

"You came? Thank you as always."

"How's the experiment? Any progress?"

"I've almost completed it. Even the clinical trials succeeded without incident. Next month, Erina will escape from those tiresome contemptuous gazes."

"Next month? That soon?"

"What are you talking about? It's been a full two years. My master and I have been pulling all-nighters every day researching. Anyway, you need to come that day too. Bring lots of alcohol instead of food then."

The period of one month felt long to everyone.

But eventually time passed, and the long-awaited moment of execution approached.

Erina lay on the bed waiting. Since Arcane and Alpheas were frantically checking the machinery, Clump spoke to her from beside her to keep her from being nervous.

"Sister-in-law, how do you feel? After today passes, you'll have Alpheas's memories. Even memories of wetting the bed as a child. You should recall well whether he ever had wandering eyes for other women. Hahaha!"

Erina burst into laughter at Clump's joke. She couldn't help being nervous, but the atmosphere was good. It seemed like everything would work out well, and the experimental device was judged to have no problems.

"Then I'll begin, Erina."

Alpheas lay beside Erina and stroked her head. Because she was the person he loved most in the world, he could give her his memories. Embarrassing memories, shameful memories—if it was her, none of it mattered.

"Honey, thank you."

"What are you talking about? I'm the one who's grateful. You really endured well. Let's live happily. Have children too."

Alpheas worried whether his smile looked awkward. To be honest, he was on the verge of losing his mind from nervousness. Arcane approached and attached machinery to both their heads. It was an experiment that brought together the treasures of all fields: magi-engineering, magi-biology, alchemy, photon mechanics, and human biology.

"I'll begin now. Relax. It'll be over quickly."

As Arcane prepared to activate the device, Clump walked to a corner and anxiously rubbed his hands. With a clicking sound, the mechanism descended. Dozens of detailed mechanisms turned with mechanical sounds, and crystals emitted light, disturbing the scenery.

Alpheas accepted the dark magic penetrating his mind without resistance.

The core principle was simple. Absorb Alpheas's memories through dark magic. Then transmit them via photon output to overwrite Erina's memories.

"Hueok!"

Erina's eyes opened wide. As a massive amount of information entered, sparks flew in her eyes. From Alpheas's earliest memories to the conversation they had just had, all the time that made him who he was being transmitted at the speed of light.

Erina smiled faintly. It felt like she was truly becoming one with Alpheas.

The excitement and worries of their first meeting, the anticipation of marriage, the happiness of newlywed life. The heart that had loved her without any prejudice was being conveyed in its complete state.

'Honey, thank you. And I love you.'

Erina closed her eyes. She had no regrets. Since being born into this world, she had received love far exceeding what she deserved.

Meeting Alpheas... was fortunate.

The light disappeared and the experiment ended. Arcane checked the control panel. Information transmission rate: 100 percent. All memories had been perfectly transmitted.

"Honey! Honey!"

Alpheas turned to look at Erina. She had a pale complexion and was breaking out in cold sweat.
