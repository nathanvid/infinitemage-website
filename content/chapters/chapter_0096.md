"Master! How did it go? Was the experiment successful?"

"Yes, it succeeded! Our magic was successful!"

But Alpheas couldn't rejoice. No matter how he looked at it, Erina's condition was strange.

"But why is my wife like this? Honey! Pull yourself together!"

Arcane checked the control panel once more and was shocked. The balance of each parameter was normal, but the overall bodily rhythm was dropping simultaneously. It was as if life itself was being extinguished.

"Th-this can't be right? The clinical trials definitely didn't show this."

"Honey! Erina! Open your eyes!"

Erina half-opened her eyes and gave a faint smile.

"Darling... I'm fine."

"Erina! What's happening? Why are you like this? What's wrong?"

"There's a rejection reaction starting from the terminal nerves. The human brain must have something different about it. But you've accomplished something truly remarkable. With just a little more research... *gasp*!"

Erina gasped heavily and convulsed.

"Honey! Don't talk! I'll figure something out! No matter what, I'll save you...!"

Alpheas cursed his own intellectual ability for already realizing this was irreversible. But he had to say those words.

Erina slowly shook her head. She knew what her husband knew.

"Darling... hold my hand."

Alpheas gripped his wife's hand tightly. If there had been even a 1% possibility, he would have tried it. But now, staying by her side was all he could do.

"Erina, this can't be happening. How can this be..."

Erina smiled sadly.

"Darling, I'm sorry."

"What are you sorry for? You haven't done anything..."

"For being foolish."

Alpheas's heart was torn to pieces. How could he have tried to change his wife? How could he have forgotten her words that existence alone was beautiful?

"No... Why are you sorry? What is there to be sorry about! It's me! I was the fool! I was the one who was foolish!"

"I'm glad I met you."

Erina could finally understand her husband. That wonderful world ruled by rationality. That's where he had been living. She was happy to have shared even this brief moment with him, to be able to leave carrying his memories.

"Honey! Open your eyes! Please... I was wrong, honey!"

As Erina's eyes closed, Alpheas embraced her face and wailed.

"Ahhhhh! Honey! Honey!"

Arcane lowered his head with a somber expression. What was different about the human brain compared to animals? If they had conducted human trials from the beginning, there would have been no tragedy.

But it was a meaningless supposition. Erina had set only one condition for experimenting on herself: absolutely no experiments on other people.

That's why they had put even more effort into it. The data obtained so far would be precious for humanity.

'I'm sorry. I won't let your sacrifice be in vain.'

A dull thud echoed. When he turned his head, Alpheas was slamming his head against the wall.

"Ahhhhh!"

Each time his forehead collided, there was a breaking sound. It was impossible to tell whether the wall or his head was breaking.

"What? The light of the Mirhi family? Light? Light!"

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Alpheas's body bounced back like a rubber ball after repeatedly hitting his head. But he didn't stop. The horror of surviving alone while leaving his wife behind was tearing him apart inside.

"Arrogant Alpheas!"

Alpheas charged at the wall again.

Bang!

Clump caught Alpheas. If he left him like this, he would surely die.

"Alpheas! Get a hold of yourself! What are you doing!"

"Let go! Damn it! Ahhhhh!"

Even with Clump's strength, it was difficult to restrain Alpheas. It was as if he was burning his soul, rushing toward death. But eventually, shock seemed to overwhelm him as his pupils dilated and consciousness faded.

"Erina... Erina..."

Clump also shed tears seeing him call his wife's name even while unconscious.

* * *

Erina's funeral was held. It was a gathering of only family members, and Alpheas was prevented from attending by relatives. They hadn't even held a wedding ceremony and had no children. In the end, the two parted as strangers.

Alpheas sat endlessly in front of the funeral hall. Then, around sunset, he rose from his spot like a madman and walked somewhere.

He arrived at Arcane's dungeon. The equipment from two years of countless experiments remained as it was.

"Erina..."

Alpheas took an oil can and sprinkled it throughout the laboratory. With each splash of oil, tears flowed from his eyes as well. The moments of laughing and chatting with her were as vivid as if they had happened yesterday.

When the oil can was empty, Alpheas leaned against the wall and sat down. This was knowledge that shouldn't exist in the world. How could humans conduct such cruel experiments?

"You came, Alpheas?"

Arcane entered the laboratory. He knew that Alpheas hadn't even been invited to the funeral. In the end, this place was like his wife's grave to him.

"I'm sorry about Erina. Take care of your mind and body for a while. Then come back and..."

Arcane realized something and turned his head. The smell of oil was too strong to have just leaked from the machinery.

"Alpheas... you don't mean to?"

Alpheas stood up with dark eyes. One fire spell would blow up the entire laboratory.

"No! What are you doing!"

"Master, this was something that should never have been done from the beginning."

"I understand you've become weak from your wife's death! But no! The experiment was almost successful! Have you forgotten Erina's will? Erasing this place would be turning away from even Erina's sacrifice!"

"None of that matters. Now that my wife is gone... I have nothing left."

"Even so, you can't! This isn't just yours and Erina's. My lifetime of knowledge is also accumulated here! These are documents that can't be carelessly destroyed without my permission."

Alpheas cast fire magic. Though Arcane absorbed it with dark magic, he couldn't do anything about the temperature that had risen above the ignition point.

Flames engulfed the room.

Thousands of documents, precision magical devices, and difficult-to-handle alchemical substances were all being transformed.

Alpheas left the dungeon, watching the flames indifferently.

But Arcane couldn't leave. He had to put out the fire. No, even if he lost everything else, he had to protect at least the experimental data.

"No, no!"

Going back and forth through the flames, Arcane was busy collecting documents. Then eventually, fire reached a box containing vaporized substances, causing an explosion.

The entire laboratory was blown away, and a shock that shook the entire underground dungeon was transmitted.

Fire that greedily sucked in air raced through the tunnels.

"Ahhhhh! Alpheas! I won't forgive you, Alpheas!"

Arcane ground his teeth. It was more unfair and frustrating than death to lose the data just before completing his life's work.

"I must... I must survive. And I will have my revenge. Wait for me, Alpheas!"

Even while being consumed by fire, Arcane hated Alpheas. Arrogant Alpheas was arrogant to the end.

Having survived through his obsession with revenge, he built up his strength while mobilizing all his connections to scour the continent. But no one knew of Alpheas's whereabouts.

Alpheas reappeared in the world seven years later.

At the main house of the Ozent family in Creas City.

"Alpheas! Hey, man! What the hell happened to you?"

Clump stared blankly at Alpheas, who had become a completely different person. His once neat face was gone, replaced by a beard grown like a madman. He wore rags and his skin was blackened.

Clump took Alpheas to the bathroom and washed him personally. Countless scars were carved into his body. Being a swordsman, he could distinguish them. Wounds from wild beasts, scars from torture, obvious self-inflicted wounds.

"Were you wandering around looking for a place to die?"

Alpheas remained silent with his wet hair covering his face. Then, after a long time, he finally spoke.

"I wasn't particularly thinking of dying. But I wasn't thinking of living either. I just wandered wherever fate took me."

"I see..."

"I heard. You became a certified swordsman. Congratulations."

"What congratulations between us? Among our peers, I was the latest."

Clump responded awkwardly. The achievements he had made while his friend experienced hell in the wilderness didn't feel particularly proud.

"Sorry. This was the only place I had to go. Let me stay here for a while."

Clump looked sadly at Alpheas's withered and twisted back.

How did it come to this?

The one who was called a supernova of the magical world had now fallen to the state of a vagrant, expelled even from his family and without a single noble acquaintance.

After finishing the bath, Clump had the maids prepare a meal. But perhaps even his stomach had shrunk, as Alpheas couldn't eat much food.

Clump knew. This wasn't someone who would visit just because he had nowhere else to go.

Taking Alpheas to the study, he offered him a drink. Alpheas didn't even look at the alcohol. However, intelligent eyes like those from seven years ago flickered briefly.

"Tell me. You appeared in the world because your wandering has ended. You need to make a comeback too, don't you? I'll help with whatever I can."

Alpheas spoke directly.

"Just lend me 100 million gold."

"100 million... gold?"

It was an enormous sum.

Of course, Clump had gained qualification for family succession by passing the certification exam. But even if he became the family head, there were limits to the amount he could invest.

"I'm not asking you to lend it all at once. I'll withdraw it over four years. Hire a financial manager. If you set the monthly limit at 7 million, it should be manageable without significant impact. I'll pay interest too. But no compound interest. Instead, match it to an annual rate of 20%. Principal repayment will be possible starting one year later."

The repayment method was for the lender to decide, but Clump didn't mind. If it was the Alpheas he knew, he would have thought of optimized transaction conditions before coming here.

In the end, it meant earning 80 million gold in profit excluding principal after four years, but he was more curious about how exactly he planned to do that.

"What are you planning? Did you develop some new magic?"

Alpheas shook his head.

"I no longer have any passion."

"Then what will you do with 100 million gold?"

"I'm going to build a school."

"What? A school?"

Clump's eyes widened. Alpheas, who had considered himself supreme between heaven and earth, was going to teach others?

"What on earth are you thinking..."

Clump couldn't finish his words when he saw tears flowing down Alpheas's cheeks.

"Never again... should someone like me emerge. I'll teach students while atoning until the moment I die. So that talent won't be trampled by a moment's mistake, I'll live gnawing at my own pain."

Alpheas covered his face with both hands and wailed. Even so, he couldn't stop the tears from flowing.

Clump's eyes also reddened.

Bastard Erina. Alpheas would probably never forget her. Perhaps he would have to live in torment for the rest of his life.

But that made the decision easy.

If the pain Alpheas had to endure could be sublimated into someone's growth, if it really could become that, then perhaps this friend who had dreamed of happiness rather than success might have a day to smile in the distant future.

"I'll lend it to you. 100 million gold."

Alpheas built a school named after himself in Creas City. During construction, he worked as a magician to pay back the interest and studied at night to earn his teaching certification.

And four years later.

Principal Mirhi Alpheas of Alpheas Magic School paid back 180 million gold in full to the Ozent family.

* * *

As the effects of Abyss Nova completely disappeared, Alpheas slowly opened his eyes. All his memories had returned, but he remained silent for a long time. The 40 years he had relived were so long and heavy.
