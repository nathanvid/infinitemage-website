"Master..."

Thad couldn't bring himself to speak readily. Was Alpheas truly the same Alpheas as before? Humans have hope because they don't know the future. But in Alpheas's memories, there was no hope. Any happy memory would only be buried beneath terrible agony.

Alpheas closed his eyes again. A single tear rolled down his cheek.

"Master, are you alright?"

"Thank you, Thad."

At the gentle tone, Thad let out a sigh of relief for now.

"Are you really okay?"

"Of course. I'm sorry for speaking harshly to you. But that was the old me."

"No, I'm the one who should be sorry. I was afraid something would happen to you, so I thought it would be better if you stayed as you were..."

Alpheas patted Thad's shoulder reassuringly.

"That was a judgment worthy of you. Perhaps that would have been better."

"Master, then..."

Thad became anxious again. Perhaps he should have pushed through with his initial thought. For Alpheas, it had been a chance to escape that would never come again.

"Yes. These are memories I never want to recall. But..."

Alpheas looked at Erina's portrait. As he remembered the moment they first met at the ball and he confessed to her, a gentle smile appeared on his lips.

"Even in the most painful life, there are times when one lives to protect just a single moment."

"I see."

Thad was finally at ease. Alpheas was exactly the same Alpheas as before, not an inch different.

The woman named Erina, who had completely shaken one man's life, remained in Alpheas's heart as pain, but also as memories he could never cast away.

"Master, the one who committed this deed is Arcane. Currently, Teacher Ethella is..."

"I had an intuition from the moment I was attacked. This isn't the time for explanations. Let's move first."

As Alpheas walked toward the door, Thad followed behind him. They had passed the first hurdle, but the real problem was just beginning. The entire student body had fallen under Arcane's evil influence.

'Please, let us not be too late.'

**To Infinity (1)**

Shirone's group remained silent for a while after learning about Alpheas's past. It had been such a shocking incident and such a heartbreakingly sad love story.

"For the headmaster to have gone through such a thing..."

A certified 4th-grade magician and headmaster of a prestigious school. Anyone would have thought it was a successful life. But listening to Arcane's story, the young Alpheas had truly been extraordinary. A Gold Circle Award winner who proved the photon theory at the tender age of twenty. Especially the memory transfer experiment was progressive thinking that the magic community was only just beginning to research.

"Certainly, Alpheas was a genius. But he was weak. If he had endured just a little longer, the world would have been different. But he ruined everything for trivial sentiment. I can never forgive such an Alpheas."

Shirone had many thoughts. Arcane was a villain recognized by the world, but he was also a magician. At least in Erina's experiment, he had been nothing more than an excellent collaborator.

"Yes. The headmaster destroying your data might have been hypocrisy."

Since Arcane's killing intent had softened, Shirone was able to approach a little closer.

"But I would have made the same choice."

"You can say such things even after seeing Alpheas's state? Well, a certified 4th-grade might seem impressive to your eyes. But if you're swayed by emotions, you can't reach the highest position. Erina's death was regrettable, but magic is magic. In that sense, Alpheas was unqualified."

Shirone shook his head. History would tell what was right, but Alpheas hadn't been swayed by emotions. At least, that's what he thought.

"If the experiment had continued, there would have been countless victims. You would have conducted human experiments without hesitation."

"I won't deny it. But the sacrifice of a few can save many. Someone is destined to suffer anyway. Isn't it the duty of intelligence to save more people even at the cost of sacrifice? If there were parents with a mentally disabled child before your eyes, what would you do? Could you still speak hypocritically then?"

"I could."

Arcane frowned in displeasure. But Shirone wasn't being stubborn.

"As you say, if sacrificing one person could save ten thousand, it would be a rational choice. Even so, I wouldn't sacrifice that one person."

"Then ten thousand people would die."

"That can't be helped."

Shirone spoke with unwavering eyes.

"Ten thousand people might die. But even if such a situation arose, it's not a realm where we humans can interfere. The very thought of weighing human lives is arrogant. Even if more people are sacrificed, we just need to do what we can. If we keep doing that, someday we'll be able to save ten thousand people. What you're trying to do is no different from a dictator trying to stand above humanity."

Arcane realized that Shirone stood at his polar opposite. Unable to sacrifice the few for the many? Someone might call this good, but if such a situation actually occurred, there wouldn't be many humans who would accept it. Humans are beings who wander between good and evil, searching for what benefits them. But Shirone was at the very end of goodness. Both cruel murderers and saints who saved humanity are inhuman. And both were equally persecuted by the masses.

'Your life won't be smooth either. Dying here might be a blessing for you.'

Magicians choose between good and evil based on intelligence. To Arcane, who believed that the efficiency of evil was what advanced humanity, Shirone was a future enemy whose sprout had to be cut.

"We're incompatible types, it seems. Regrettably, you'll have to die."

Shirone stepped back in alarm. Arcane, who had clearly seemed weakened just moments ago, was now emanating the aura of a true Great Magician.

"Surprised, boy? Magic is a mysterious thing."

According to Magic Association research, the mental fatigue when a magician casts pure magic is equivalent to an ordinary person concentrating on one task for 48 minutes.

But Arcane ignored such arithmetic calculations and instantly drew up his power.

"Let's end this. There will be no pain."

Shadows surged from Arcane's body, and a black curtain covered the sky. People were horrified by its massive size. The scale was completely different from the Power of Darkness that Canis had displayed.

When Arcane raised his right hand, the curtain gathered into the form of a fist. Shirone was purely amazed. Judging by the fist's size, if it fell, it would blow away half the basin.

'I can't block it. And I can't dodge it either.'

If the Power of Darkness were quantified, the force exerted in a unit cube (1 centimeter in width, length, and height) would be approximately 0.1Nâ€”slightly better than an ant's jaw joint. But when it exceeded hundreds of millions of units, it became tremendous force reaching thousands of tons that could sweep away everything on earth.

"Stop this disgraceful behavior, Master."

Everyone in the basin turned their gaze to the cliff. Alpheas stood with his hands clasped behind his back. Then a streak of light curved in with a roar, and Thad landed beside Alpheas.

"Teacher Thad!"

Color returned to the faces of Shirone's group. Just the arrival of Alpheas and Thad felt like gaining a mighty army. Thad looked up at the Power of Darkness and cast Fire Line. Flame streams rose in a double helix formation, then gathered into a massive fireball.

"Wow..."

As the surrounding scenery was bleached white, they couldn't even open their eyes. But Arcane negated the retina-burning light with the power of dark magic and glared directly at it.

"Hmm."

He spread his palm toward the Fire Line, and the Power of Darkness floating in the sky took the same pose and moved, grasping the giant fireball.

Tssssssss!

Shirone trembled. It was his first time hearing something burn away with such an enormously loud sound. As the world was plunged back into darkness, Thad grimaced and converted his Spirit Zone to offensive form.

"Tch! Annoying old geezer...!"

Alpheas raised his hand to stop him.

"Stop it, Thad."

"But Master..."

"This is my business. Mine and Arcane's. Leave it to me from here."

Alpheas walked leisurely. Then Arcane also returned the Power of Darkness that had extinguished the Fire Line to curtain form and spread it across the sky.

"You've aged, Alpheas. Well, even the Time Magician is just a human before the passage of years."

Alpheas ignored the greeting after 40 years. At least not yet... This wasn't the time for two foolish, senile old men to settle past affairs. After checking on the hundreds of students and the injured Iruki, Nade, and Shirone, he finally looked at Ethella. Bruises from clearly having clashed with Arcane were spread across her pale skin.

"You've suffered, Ethella. It's my fault for being immoral. I can only apologize."

"No, I'm sorry. I couldn't save the students."

Alpheas shook his head. When she came for a teacher interview, excelling in magic, physical arts, and mental discipline with no weaknesses, he had been puzzled. But today, he couldn't be prouder of his judgment in hiring her. Without her, the current situation where all students were safe wouldn't have existed.

"Headmaster. Please be careful."

Shirone spoke with a worried expression. If Arcane's energy was depleted, he thought certified 4th-grade Alpheas could handle it well enough. But the current Arcane was definitely in peak condition.

Alpheas smiled knowingly as if he already understood.

"Don't worry. There's no magic that defies the principle of equivalent exchange."

"But Arcane's mental power is certainly..."

"Yes. It must have recovered. But that too is magic."

"Magic?"

"Abyss-type magic controls memories. It's magic that Arcane created and excels at most. Isn't that right, Master?"

Arcane snorted.

"You don't seem to have dementia. For reference, the magic you suffered is incomparableâ€”it's called Abyss Nova. You experienced the effects firsthand, so there's no need to explain."

"It was excellent magic. Thanks to it, I could recall old memories, which was nice."

"Don't put on airs. You ran away in terror. You were probably just crying your eyes out."

"You hit it right on target. But Master, you've also become much weaker while we haven't seen each other. To struggle so much against children 100 years younger that you had to cast Abyss Memory."

Arcane didn't get angry. When Alpheas was calm, he was calm too. Forty years of accumulated hatred couldn't be resolved by mere words.

Alpheas turned his head to Shirone as if enjoying the calm before the storm.

"Shirone. To cast magic requires powerful concentration in an instant. It's like using in one second the result of an ordinary person's one hour of concentration. So this is what Arcane did."

Alpheas tapped his temple with his index finger.

"He cast it on his own head. Memory-erasing magic."

"Ah..."

There was such a method. If memories of brain usage were erased, mental fatigue would disappear. Of course, there would inevitably be functional overload, but once would be enough to fully recover mental power.

Alpheas understood Shirone's feelings. Viktor Arcane. A magician who had survived 100 years on battlefields with dark magic, a minority field. Regardless of past grudges, his skill had to be acknowledged.

"Yes. It's a bold and magnificent technique. Arcane is a magician living in such a world. So remember this too. One who doesn't have even one final measure can never be called a battle magician."
