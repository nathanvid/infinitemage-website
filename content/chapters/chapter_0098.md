Arcane wore an unpleasant expression.

"Hmph. You praising me? Even passing dogs would laugh at that."

"Are you sure about this? Though your mental strength has been restored, it's ultimately just a trick of the brain. If you intend to go further, I cannot guarantee your life."

There was no such thing as free magic. The mental strength restored through Abyss Memory was an equivalent exchange accomplished at the risk of brain death.

"So what? Are you ultimately trying to stop me?"

"If you withdraw, we could end things here. This might be your last chance. I can make this proposal because everyone is still safe. But if you cannot abandon your obsession, you'll have to pay the price."

"Heh heh heh. Your silver tongue is as sharp as ever. You pretend to be considerate, but in the end you only think of yourself. Do you think your past will be covered up if I withdraw? It's already too late. Not only those present here, but the students affected by Abyss Nova still have their ears open, so you won't be able to remain as headmaster any longer."

Shirone looked back at the students who had lost their memories. Once the magic was broken, all the events that occurred here would remain in their memories. Even if the battle ended safely, it would still be a disaster.

"Heh heh! Do you finally understand the situation? How about killing everyone here instead? If so, I'd be willing to cover for you?"

Alpheas slightly raised the corner of his mouth.

"What a joke."

"Then how about coming with me? I'm the one offering you a final chance. Shouldn't you carry on Erina's will? Look here. See what I've accomplished. The magical creature Harvest!"

Shirone's group looked where Arcane was pointing. Harvest lay collapsed on the ground like a tattered rag.

"...Well, it became somewhat unsightly. Anyway, the experiment was successful. If you help me, we could achieve even greater results. And that's what Erina truly wanted."

A cold light flickered in Alpheas's eyes upon hearing Erina's name.

"Master. Please grow up."

Arcane finally revealed his killing intent. Though they were exchanging trivial conversation, it was all meaningless talk. From the beginning, it was an irreconcilable bitter relationship.

"Do you think someone like you can defeat me? Headmaster? How ridiculous. Making foolish judgments while pretending to be smartâ€”that hasn't changed from then to now, Alpheas."

The Power of Darkness spread in the air condensed again into the shape of a fist. In response, Alpheas slowly raised both hands and prepared to cast magic.

"No, this is right. One foolish judgment is enough."

Alpheas compressed photons between his palms. Seeing the photon output that any light mage could cast, Arcane snorted unpleasantly.

"You think you can stop me with that? You've grown weak, Alpheas."

"We won't know until we try."

"Heh heh! Wasn't that the phrase you hated most? Where's the Alpheas who used to say you must know before trying?"

"A mage is one who lives in the future. Though my vigor has declined, I haven't just grown old. Do you think I couldn't calculate your forty years?"

"Ho. You foresaw today? And all you prepared is a photon output?"

"Let's end this."

Alpheas raised both hands to the sky. The photons between his palms compressed until they became smaller than dust. Simultaneously, Arcane swung his fist. The enormous Power of Darkness poured down toward the ground. This would end it. A strike pouring out forty years of resentment.

Shirone's group stared blankly at the Power of Darkness falling at tremendous speed. Seeing it up close, it was much more massive than they had expected.

Alpheas's hands slowly fell downward. The movement of his arms flowed like water, then began splitting into dozens of afterimages. Those watching all had puzzled looks in their eyes.

'What is this?'

Alpheas's afterimages moved torturously slowly. The photons compressed in his palms suddenly disappeared. Meanwhile, the Power of Darkness hadn't even reached half the distance yet.

Shirone couldn't move a single fingertip. No, even breathing was impossible. Time was flowing slowly. Only a single drop of photons smaller than a speck was moving at the speed of light.

The photon plunged into the massive darkness. Ripples rose like waves, spreading outward with amplitude as slow as the slowed time.

And the next moment.

Flash!

A powerful explosion of light occurred, turning the world into blank paper.

The Power of Darkness tore apart and scattered. The radiance spreading throughout the magic school weakened from the center and disappeared in the form of rings.

As time returned to normal, Shirone's group looked up at the sky with bewildered expressions. In the night sky where even clouds had vanished, a pale moon hung.

'What kind of magic was that?'

It didn't have physical force like Photon Cannon, nor persistence like Shining. It was magic created solely to explode the strongest light in an instant.

Arcane's face contorted.

"Alpheas..."

"It's magic called Big Bang. Though it's embarrassing to submit to the association, I think it's sufficient as a farewell gift."

"Indeed... you weren't just running away for forty years."

Arcane realized Alpheas's intention. It wasn't magic developed as a countermeasure to dark magic. Nor was it meant to surpass him.

Alpheas had refined Big Bang for forty years, considering only this moment, only this situation.

"Not bad, for you."

Arcane's knees hit the ground with a thud. The aftereffects of Abyss Memory had seriously impaired his brain function.

"Lucky you, Alpheas. Your fifty-year bet succeeded. You defeated the great Arcane, so your reputation will rise. Do you want to become the Great Magician you've dreamed of?"

Alpheas shook his head. Even in such moments, the competitive spirit obsessed with superiority and inferiority. While knowing this was the driving force that created today's Arcane, he felt sorry for him.

"Master is no longer a Great Magician. You were called that fifty years ago. It's enough time for a 10th-grade rookie to become a 2nd-grade Great Magician and more. Our era is already over. The world has changed, and we're too old to have ambitions. How can you not know this?"

Blood vessels stood out on Arcane's temples. Though defeated, the years he had lived weren't pathetic enough to receive lectures from his student.

"Why do you think you're the arrogant Alpheas? You probably think you've been unluckily caught up in misfortune. Let me tell you the truth. You're not a genius. You're just a pathetic mage running away from misfortune."

Arcane put strength into his trembling legs and stood up.

"Old? I became a Great Magician at your age. How about being honest? That you lack confidence. Aren't you making excuses because you lack confidence to rise any higher?"

"Rising isn't everything. If you've aged, you should have appropriate reflection. But Master is no different from a boy chasing sweet ambitions even now."

"Heh heh heh! Foolish Alpheas! What exactly are you so afraid of? Step back just one step and look. There's no categorical imperative in this world that says things should be a certain way!"

A terrifying aura exploded from Arcane's body again. Alpheas's eyes widened in shock, realizing he had erased memories with Abyss magic once more. While the brain could withstand one Abyss Memory, the second was almost certainly death.

"Foolish old fool! Are you determined to die?"

Arcane responded with mockery and cast the Power of Darkness. The shadow beneath his feet expanded enough to cover the basin, lifting the memory-lost students into the air and moving them to the cliff.

Even Alpheas couldn't help but be terrified this time.

"Stop! It's just meaningless slaughter! What would this leave you with?"

"The satisfaction of victory."

"You fool! At your age, you still want to win! Do you think you'll be a boy forever?"

"Foolish Alpheas. Listen carefully."

At the final moment of his life, Arcane spoke with a confident smile.

"A mage... is an eternal boy."

The 400 people caught by the Power of Darkness flew outside the cliff as if scooped up with a ladle. Alpheas couldn't understand. To use the mental strength obtained in exchange for life on such foolishness.

'What exactly moves you? What does such senseless conviction bring?'

Anyway, now wasn't the time to worry about Arcane. Having poured all his strength into Big Bang magic, Alpheas hurriedly looked to the side and shouted.

"Save the students!"

As soon as the order fell, Thad transformed into Flash and flew away. Shirone followed, then Nade and Iruki also cast teleportation to the cliff. It was 400 people. They couldn't save them all anyway. But even such thoughts were a luxury given how urgent the situation was.

Thad, who had descended to the middle of the cliff, created a wall of air with air-type magic. But since he needed to create a wall of at least 50 square meters, the thickness inevitably became thin.

Eventually holes opened in the weak parts of the durability, and students poured down below.

Below Thad, Iruki and Nade were active. But it was too late to turn the situation around. Tears welled up at the sight of everyone from young children to graduating adults falling like rain.

"Damn it! Shit, shit!"

Through his blurry vision, Iruki looked up at the sky. A star in the night sky twinkled, then a streak of Flash descended vertically.

"Shirone!"

The Flash passed even Iruki and continued downward. In Shirone's eyes moving at ultra-high speed, a red-haired girl came into view.

"Amy!"

Hearing Shirone's voice, Amy turned her gaze. Since it was an impossible reaction while under Abyss Nova, Shirone shouted again with a glimmer of hope.

"Amy! Snap out of it!"

'Snap out?'

Humans are thinking beings. It's harder not to think than to think. But when caught by Abyss Nova, which blocks memories, the source of thought itself isn't provided.

"Amy! Amy!"

Nevertheless, Amy could think.

Because she was Amy of the Carmis family.

"Amy! Please snap out of it!"

'So annoying. Please don't do this.'

"It's me! It's Shirone!"

'Shirone?'

What did that mean? It was an unknown word. But Amy couldn't let go of the three syllables that kept tickling her brain.

'What is it, what is it? What was it? I'm so curious.'

Amy kept thinking. Electricity spread through her cerebral cortex and began searching for information. Finally, one pattern sparked and the meaning of Shirone flooded into her body.

'Ah, right. Shirone! It was Shirone.'

Amy exhaled deeply as if she thought she'd die from frustration. Simultaneously, her eyes blazed red and her red eyes ability activated. Abyss Nova burned away instantly and memories rushed in like a tide.

'You idiot! What am I doing right now?'

Her trait was red eyes. Academically called self-image memory.

People of the Carmis family could return their state to a specific point when their red eyes manifested.

For instance, they could store the motion of drawing and slashing a sword and repeat the exact same motion infinitely without error. Moreover, since it was in the realm of feeling like Schema, error correction was also instantaneous.

The maxim 'One mistake is the foundation of development, two mistakes are the family's shame' was what revealed their confidence.

'What? What state am I in right now?'

Amy analyzed the error at the neural level based on self-image memory. Currently under the influence of gravitational acceleration. The body's center was tilted 87.6 degrees and the heart rate was 1.6 times faster.

'I'm falling.'

She had no particular complaints about that. She could see Shirone descending on Flash. The things she had done to him came to mind. How could she forget Shirone?
