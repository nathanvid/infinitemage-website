'Like an idiot... such an idiot...!'

He had approached her first, had offered her coffee, yet she had coldly pushed his hand away. Amy squeezed her eyes shut as if trying to avoid the scenes filled with regret. Then she shouted with all her might.

"Shirone!"

Shirone smiled. He was relieved that Amy had recovered her memories. At least in his final moments, he could depart as the Shirone who remained in someone's memory.

"Thank you, Amy."

Shirone's tears fell onto Amy's cheek.

'Why are you crying, Shirone?'

Amy felt anxious. Something was wrong. Then, the moment she saw the will to live gradually fading from Shirone's eyes, she realized.

"Shirone! No!"

"I'm sorry. For not keeping my promise."

Shirone embraced Amy and completely opened his Immortal Function. As his consciousness expanded infinitely, his sense of self began to fade like dissolving in water.

'Goodbye everyone...'

Father, mother, the family of the Ozent household, his friends at school. Having been loved by so many people, Shirone could smile. A massive light filled the space beneath the cliff completely. The falling students, Iruki and Nade, even Thad were enveloped in the radiance and disappeared from sight.

The next moment, a tremendous flash shot up vertically.

It was a mass teleport that simultaneously moved a full 400 people.

'Ah, I see now.'

Arcane, lying sprawled on the ground, watched the flash that had shot up above the cliff scatter into dozens of streams. Only in the final moment did he feel certain. About where he had been. And what a wonderful life he had lived.

'A playground too entertaining even for a lifetime of play. Isn't that right, Alpheas?'

The legendary Great Magician who had once dominated an era departed from the world like that.

"Master?"

Canis stood dazed before Arcane's corpse. Had he not been a disciple after all? But Arcane had left without even leaving final words, doing only what he wanted until the very end.

"Was it really nothing at all? Were we just tools?"

Canis ran to Arcane and shook his collar.

"Get up! How can this be! I should have died instead! Why are you leaving me behind and going away!"

Arin approached Canis with sad eyes. His reflection in her mirror showed a human figure made of muddy liquid. That form never stayed still, constantly spreading like liquid before rising back into human shape.

"No, Canis. He didn't die because of you. That man used us. He's a scoundrel of the highest order."

"Hehehe, what do you mean no? You're finally realizing it now."

Harvest spoke in a murky voice.

"That's right, Canis. Everyone died because of you. Arcane, me, and someday Arin will die too."

Arin glared at Harvest then quickly turned her head to Canis. As expected, shocked by the impact, his human form collapsed and dissolved into muddy water that clung to the floor.

"Why? What did I do wrong? For living in Radum? For being an unlucky bastard?"

"Because you're weak."

Harvest's conclusion was simple.

"How long will you live just hoping for others' recognition? There's no such thing as 'you must live like this' or 'you must die like that.' Arcane simply lived his own life and left."

Arcane had sacrificed his life to uphold his evil convictions. Harvest had chosen self-destruction to fulfill his contract as a magical creature.

'What was I... trying to die for?'

He could find nothing. He was nothing more than a blindfolded colt running wild. A life made up entirely of empty shells.

"Like master..."

"Yes, and like that boy."

At the center where 400 students lay scattered, Shirone had collapsed. He had said he wouldn't let anyone get hurt. And he had kept his conviction to the very end.

Canis approached Harvest to check his condition.

"How are you doing?"

"However I am, I'll die. I can't survive without parasitizing life."

Arin said.

"Make a master-servant contract with me. Canis won't be able to endure after exhausting his mental strength."

Harvest shook his head.

"Sorry, but that won't work."

"What? Why? You'll just disappear like this!"

"Because my master is Canis."

Harvest's words pierced Canis's heart. Now it was time for him to raise his own banner of conviction. Could he endure it? If things went wrong, they could both lose their lives.

"Harvest. I'll accept you as my subordinate. But I won't forgive a second betrayal."

"Hehehe. Understood, master."

"Canis! It's too dangerous! If something goes wrong...!"

Arin stopped speaking. Mud was seeping into Canis's liquid form, hardening it. Would he someday be able to obtain an unshakeable heart? Like Shirone's form that she had seen in her mirror.

Canis placed his hand on Harvest. As the subordination contract proceeded, Harvest began absorbing what little life force remained. His eyes slowly closed as his consciousness sank into darkness.

At a distance from Canis's group, Alpheas stood in grief. Though they had barely managed to save the students, too much had been lost.

"Headmaster."

Ethella felt the same way. Starting today, there would be major changes at the magic school. Students who recovered their memories would fall into confusion, and Alpheas's mistake from 40 years ago would also surface.

"Ethella, I am a sinner."

"Don't blame yourself too much. If life cannot tolerate even mistakes, then human existence itself would be sinful."

Alpheas shook his head. Anyone can make mistakes. But all actions come with responsibility. Like Arcane, he had no intention of running away.

"He was someone who elevated dark magic to the ranks of great magic. Harvest could be called an innovation in the field of memory transfer. Abyss Nova will be registered as a regulation magic with the Magic Association."

Before Arcane's corpse, Alpheas clasped his hands together and mourned the death.

"Great Magician Arcane, who was always a boy. The path of magic you walked will continue to future generations."

When Alpheas opened his eyes, he looked relieved. Ethella, however, was still worried. It was an incident where all the students' lives had been threatened, so it wasn't a problem that could be handled within the school.

"Headmaster, what are you thinking of doing from now on?"

"What could I have to say? I'm also just in a position of waiting for treatment. Rather than leave the matter of punishment to experts, how about we celebrate today's hero?"

Alpheas looked around to find Shirone. The more he saw, the more the boy had a talent for surprising people. Even he couldn't guarantee he could simultaneously move 400 people.

"Something terrible has happened!"

Amy was sobbing where Shirone had collapsed.

Sensing the ominous atmosphere, Alpheas and Ethella quickened their steps. In the distance, Iruki and Nade were running toward them.

But before they could arrive, Amy cried out first.

"Shirone isn't breathing!"

**Meeting God (1)**

Shirone had expanded vastly and also grown thin. Forgetting even his attachment to the world, he was permeating everything. Then some powerful force pulled him into a single point. If there was something beyond life for humans, it could be called a hijacking of the soul.

"Gasp! Gasp!"

As Shirone's mind reassembled, memories from before attempting the Immortal Function revived. Briefly trembling from the terror of death, he exhaled roughly while checking his body's condition. Aside from not wearing clothes, there seemed to be no particular problems.

"Where is this?"

It was a space filled with white. In this place where a monochrome landscape stretched infinitely, he couldn't feel any sense of distance. He tried walking slowly, but couldn't even think he was moving forward.

'This is very strange. It's like my five senses are paralyzed.'

Shirone suddenly thought of something unique. As an experiment, he slowly bent his knees and stepped with his sole as if climbing stairs. Amazingly, his body floated up.

"Huh?"

Shirone climbed endless stairs. Stopping briefly to look around, he was speechless.

"......"

He didn't feel like he had climbed to a high place. Wherever he moved, it was just the same white landscape as before.

"There's no distance."

If it cannot be measured, space doesn't exist. To confirm his hypothesis, Shirone tried going down this time. His expectation was correct. No matter where he moved, he hadn't actually moved.

When he could no longer find meaning in moving, a woman's voice was heard.

"Impressive. To grasp the meaning of space. You truly have the qualifications to come here."

Shirone didn't turn around. There was no concept of direction in this place anyway.

"Who are you? Am I dead?"

A beautiful woman walked out from gaps in the white landscape. As a sense of distance emerged, the scenery changed instantly. A massive temple unlike anything he had ever seen seemed to press down on Shirone.

"Wow..."

It was a scale beyond imagination. Even ancient temples weren't this large. Hundreds of pillars supported the ceiling, each roughly 2 kilometers in height.

"What is this place..."

"Nice to meet you, Shirone. I've been waiting for you."

It was a woman with water-colored hair that reached her ankles. Shirone had never seen such a beautiful woman in his life. It wasn't a matter of appearance. The value of existence. Just as a man in love feels his lover is the most beautiful in the world, her value here was absolute.

"Oh no!"

Shirone hastily covered himself. He had been boldly exposing his naked body without realizing it.

"Hehe. There's nothing to be embarrassed about. This isn't your world. Your body is still in the original world."

With a wave of the woman's hand, clothes instantly appeared on him. Shirone stared blankly at his appearance before finally giving up. Only one thing came to mind immediately.

"Is this the afterlife?"

"No. It's not the afterlife. It's just a different spot from where you lived."

Shirone tilted his head. A spot is one-dimensional with no space. A spot moves to become a line, a line moves to become a plane, and a plane moves to finally become three-dimensional space.

"Could it be...?"

Shirone recalled the white space where he had been moments before.

"That's right. That's the spot. It's not that there's no space, but that it's compressed to infinity."

If what she said was true, it was natural that he couldn't feel any sense of distance. But even if trapped in one dimension, his own body was three-dimensional. If he could measure the distance between his right and left arms, wouldn't space exist?

"Ah. You mean one dimension contains three dimensions."

"Your insight is truly remarkable. That's right. That's the essence of spacetime. No matter how vast a world is, when seen from afar it's nothing more than a single point. Conversely, no matter how small a point is, when you go inside it, an infinite world unfolds."

Shirone could finally calm down. If this was a world where logical conversation was possible, there was no need to fear even if it was the afterlife.

"Then who are you?"

The woman smiled like an innocent child. Though it felt eerie, even that seemed beautiful to Shirone. Because she was the most valuable being in this place.

"I am God."

* * *

The magic school was in complete chaos.

It took a full 8 hours just to collect Arcane's body and return the students to their dormitories.

The students still lay in their respective rooms with their memories blocked. If the faculty recovered their memories, the work would gain momentum, but thinking about the disturbance that would occur when all the students regained consciousness made heads throb.

To make matters worse, even the suspects Canis and Arin had disappeared without a trace, so in the end, only Nade, Iruki, and Amy were left to care for Shirone, who had been moved to the infirmary.

Actually, "care" wasn't the right word. Shirone wasn't breathing and his heart had also stopped. But no one would speak the word death.
