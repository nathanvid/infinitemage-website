"Shirone..."

Amy grasped Shirone's hand with eyes swollen from crying. The teachers were currently in chaos, so no one came to visit. Or perhaps they had already accepted the fact that Shirone was dead.

But Amy shook her head in denial. She couldn't believe that Shirone was dead. There were too many suspicious aspects to simply call it obsession.

Nade offered words of comfort.

"Senior, don't worry. Shirone will come back."

"Right. It doesn't make sense logically. Why would he die? If he was going to die from casting Mass Teleport, it shouldn't have activated in the first place. Something strange definitely happened to Shirone."

Iruki frowned disapprovingly. He had been keeping vigil all night as well, but there was nothing more foolish in the world than mistaking the dead for the living.

"If we're going to argue like that, Arcane should have lived too. Just casting magic is enough to kill someone."

"The situation is different from Arcane! Shirone completely opened his Immortal Function. That has nothing to do with brain function deterioration!"

"Either way, he exceeded his capacity. Humans can die from any variable. What matters is whether he's dead or alive, not questioning why he died. That's not rational."

Nade grimaced. Even if it was true, there were things you could say and things you couldn't say in front of a girlfriend. Just as he was about to snap back, Amy approached Iruki with cold eyes.

"You're as unpleasant now as you were before."

Iruki looked at Amy while resting his chin on the table. Her pupils were burning red.

'The Carmis family. Well, if it's Insight, she'd be immune to mental-type magic.'

Insight was a famous trait on the continent. The only thing that could invade their minds would be Anti Magic, so it made sense that she had escaped from Abyss Nova. But his thoughts stopped there, and he soon turned his gaze away disinterestedly.

"Blaming others because you're in a bad mood is a bad habit."

"No. You're the one ruining the atmosphere. What are you? Are you really Shirone's friend? How can you think Shirone is dead?"

"I didn't think he might be dead. I said he is dead."

"That's even worse! And you, as a Class Five, who are you speaking informally to?"

"If it bothers you, report me to the student council. I don't care if I get disciplined."

Amy couldn't contain herself and approached him. She grabbed Iruki by the collar and lifted him up with her Schema's power. Iruki's feet left the ground.

"Say that again. But this time, you better say it properly."

"Oh, how scary."

There was no emotion in Iruki's eyes. He just looked down at Amy with completely empty pupils. But Amy was the type who didn't care about consequences when her temper flared.

"Repeat what I say. Shirone is not dead. Otherwise, you'll end up lying next to Shirone."

"Shirone is dead."

"Shirone is not dead! Repeat it quickly!"

"Shirone is dead."

Amy's Insight flickered. Using self-image memory to design the accuracy of her punch, she aimed for Iruki's third and fourth teeth and threw her fist. But Iruki didn't even change his expression. Seeing the deceleration, it was clear she would stop right before his lips.

As expected, Amy stopped her motion just before impact. Watching her trembling fist full of resentment, Iruki said dryly.

"Ah, that's a relief."

"Don't be ridiculous! Disgusting servant. A person like you probably doesn't understand why I stopped my fist."

Amy couldn't hit Iruki. No matter how much she hated him, he was Shirone's friend.

"The meaning of stopping your fist. Something like wasting energy for nothing?"

Sparks flew from Amy's eyes.

"So you're saying with that foul mouth that Shirone is dead too? You know what? A person like you doesn't deserve to have friends."

"Maybe so. But do you all deserve it?"

"What's that supposed to mean? This is really...!"

Amy grabbed his collar again and raised her fist. Then Iruki frowned for the first time and shook off the hand holding his collar.

"Damn it!"

As Amy shook off her hand and looked at him, Iruki walked to the bed and pointed at Shirone.

"You're the pathetic ones. Does this look alive to you? He's not breathing and his heart has stopped! But you're spouting nonsense about how he's actually alive, or something strange happened - what kind of friends are you!"

"Then what should I do! What should I do when Shirone is in this situation!"

"That's why I'm telling you to think!"

Iruki shouted with an excitement rarely seen from him.

"Do you think dead people will come back to life if you think they're alive? If you have the mental energy to spout such nonsense, at least try to think of a way to bring back the dead!"

Amy, who had been biting her lips searching for words to say, finally realized and hung her head dejectedly. Iruki was right. Shirone was mathematically dead.

Nade said with a sad expression.

"I understand what you mean. But Iruki, how do we save him? There's no way to bring back the dead..."

"Hmph, that's your limitation."

Iruki slammed the door shut and left. Silence fell over the infirmary. As Amy sat in a chair and covered her face, Nade comforted her.

"Senior. Don't hate him too much. Iruki is acting like that because he's frustrated too."

"Forget it. I don't want to care about that bastard. Think of a way to bring back the dead? Doesn't he know that's an even bigger wound?"

Nade couldn't answer that either. While it might be typical Iruki behavior, today he felt disappointed in such a friend.

Iruki, who had left the infirmary, frowned as he walked down the corridor. The two people he least wanted to see were waiting. Canis was leaning against the wall, and Arin was looking around anxiously, unable to find a place to rest her gaze.

Since they were the main instigators of this incident, they should be strictly monitored, but the problem was that the current situation wasn't leisurely enough to pay attention to them.

Of course, Iruki didn't have peace of mind either. If they had decided to run away, they would have done so long ago. Though they probably couldn't escape the Magic Association's eyes anyway.

"Did you come to rub salt in the wound? Or are you here to apologize now?"

Canis pushed off from the wall.

"Both. I came to rub salt in the wound and apologize. Dying in battle is one thing, but it's annoying that Shirone was sacrificed for something meaningless. But it seems like bad timing."

He must have heard the argument with Amy from outside. Iruki scratched his head irritably, thinking he had shown an embarrassing side.

"Good thinking. Even if you go in now, you won't see anything good. The girl in the infirmary will start by breaking your legs. Anyway, give it your best shot. I'm leaving."

Canis followed Iruki with his eyes as he passed by.

"I don't care about that. Bad timing means even the opportunity has disappeared. What apology can I give to someone who's already dead?"

Iruki, who had stopped walking, turned to look at Canis with frightening wide eyes.

"What?"

"I completely agree with your opinion. Dead is dead. Seeing them make a fuss over a corpse makes me lose all desire to apologize."

Iruki thought for a moment, then burst into laughter.

"For someone who died and came back to life, you talk well. Whose idea is that? Yours? Or the shadow's?"

"...Are you suggesting we have a fight here?"

"Shirone, you see, is quite an irritating friend from my perspective."

As Iruki brought up an unexpected topic, Canis's brow furrowed.

"Actually, I'm an incredibly strange and bad person. So I decided to put constraints on myself. You could say Shirone is like my lock."

"Hmph. A weak way of thinking."

"Is it? Well, if it weren't for Shirone, I might not have thought this way. Anyway, now that Shirone isn't here. So I'd appreciate it if you'd be careful with your words from now on."

Arin, sensing something from Iruki, flinched and stepped back.

"Because I'm different from Shirone. If I put my mind to it, I can do any crazy thing. So you'd better pray that Shirone definitely comes back alive to stop me."

Iruki's pupils, glaring at Canis, began to flash. It was sparks generated in the cerebrum shining through his eyes.

"If Shirone ends like this, I'll kill you first by any means necessary."

Canis's mental channel opened, and Harvest's brain waves were transmitted.

-Canis, warning level. You've been targeted.

-I know. I already knew he was a servant.

-It's not just that level. His calculation speed is incredibly fast. Based on the Spirit Zone's movement, it's estimated to be more than 10,000 times faster than our mental channel.

Canis couldn't believe it. Opinion exchange with Harvest was faster than the speed of thought. Being 10,000 times faster than that was a speed unimaginable by human common sense.

-What level is that?

-It's enough information to analyze all events occurring in a city for 3 seconds. A special strategy is needed to deal with him. But we're criminals. Causing trouble here could make the situation unfavorable.

Canis didn't want to back down. This stubbornness was exactly why he had been selected as Arcane's top disciple, but the timing wasn't good. While Harvest desperately tried to stop him, Arin intervened.

"But doesn't that mean you also think Shirone isn't dead?"

Iruki's Spirit Zone disappeared. Arin, who had been sensing killing intent through her initial perception, finally felt like she could breathe. Iruki calmed his mind. He had to be more composed than anyone. It was enough to have the fools in the infirmary being swept away by emotions and ruining things.

"Shirone is dead. If we don't accept the facts, no solution will emerge. I'm just thinking rationally."

"No. You believe Shirone is alive. Maybe even more than those two people in that room."

Iruki frowned. Servant was the strongest ability for calculating the causality of events. There was no room for illogical emotions to interfere.

"What do you know about me to be babbling?"

"I have an ability called Initial Perception. I perceive all things as if seeing them for the first time. So I can't remember the forms of objects. They look different every time."

"So? What's your point?"

"I can see your emotions. In a completely different form from what others see."

"I'm fine. Dead is dead. There's no room for emotions to interfere."

"No. It's different."

Arin shook her head.

"Because right now, you're crying with such a sad expression."

Iruki couldn't answer.

As Arin said, before Initial Perception, a hundred words were useless.

That night.

The infirmary door slowly opened.

Amy had collapsed on a cot, exhausted from crying, and Nade was dozing in a chair in the corner.

Iruki approached Shirone. Sleeping and being dead felt different from the start. Seeing Shirone's coldly cooled face felt heartbreaking.

When morning came, the teachers would come to examine Shirone. They would prioritize embalming for the funeral, but if that happened, there would be no way to save Shirone anymore.

Iruki composed his emotions and pulled out a scalpel hidden in his jacket.

'I'll definitely save you.'

He checked on Amy and Nade, but there were no signs of them waking up. They had been under extreme stress for two days already, so it was natural. Only then did Iruki raise the scalpel.

The blade reflecting moonlight cut into Shirone's skin.
