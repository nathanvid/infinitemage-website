Shirone felt as if he'd been struck in the head with a hammer. While he could accept the plausibility that this place was the afterlife, meeting a god was an entirely different matter.

"You're saying you're a god?"

"Don't you believe me?"

"Well, I didn't even know gods existed, but even if they did, I wouldn't have thought they'd be this... human."

The woman smiled.

"All creations inevitably resemble their creator. Just as any object made by humans contains human thoughts and forms within it. Plants, animals, mountains and seasâ€”they all resemble God. But the degree varies. The standard is creativity. For instance, a squirrel is more creative than a rock. In that sense, humans quite resemble God. And Shirone, you are one of the people who most resembles God."

The woman reached out and stroked Shirone's face.

"Shirone. Won't you create the world with me?"

Shirone was confused. Everything was too sudden and unfamiliar. Most of all, the woman's words that this place wasn't the afterlife lingered in his mind. Perhaps a small hope might emerge.

"Isn't there a way to return?"

The woman looked at Shirone as if surprised, then shook her head.

"Unfortunately, Shirone, there's no way to return. Wasn't it your choice to end your life? Do you want to go back now?"

"It's not that. It was certainly something I was prepared for, and if it weren't for you, I wouldn't have been able to regain my consciousness like this. Ah, excuse me... may I address you like this?"

"Of course. Being a god is just a concept. I don't have a name."

"Then may I ask one more thing?"

"Hehe, anything at all."

"Why are you lying?"

The woman's brow furrowed. Just that alone made it feel as if the temple was shaking.

"Gods do not lie. No, they are beings who cannot lie."

If she were an omnipotent god, lying would be impossible. Because she could make any statement become truth. But Shirone read something in the woman's eyes. She was hiding something.

"When I asked if there was a way to return, you said there wasn't. But that's not true."

"Whether there's a way to return or not, since I said there isn't, there is no way to return. That's the reason."

"That's exactly what I mean by lying."

"You don't understand, Shirone. I said there's no way to return. So you cannot return, absolutely not!"

"Then let me rephrase. Regardless of your intentions, what I want to hear is whether a method to return to the original world exists."

"No such method exists!"

"Another lie!"

The woman's shoulders flinched. Shirone didn't miss her reaction. As she became flustered, the temple's scenery wavered as if submerged in water.

"Are you really a god?"

He had been suspicious from the beginning. Of course, there was no reason the actual form of God had to match what humans imagined, but even so, the woman's reactions were far too human.

The woman nodded as if understanding something.

"Shirone. We have different concepts of what God is. That's why this misunderstanding occurred. God isn't as sublime an existence as you think. They're simply the designer of the world."

The woman extended her hand, and a glass sphere appeared above her palm. Inside the glass sphere was the scenery of a small village with people scattered here and there.

"As you can see, I created a village. It's a model, of course. But I can move people like this."

The woman put her finger into the glass sphere and moved a farmer who was feeding his horse to a nearby field.

"See, the farmer moved. Changing space means I've granted time. Can you find any difference from the world where Shirone lived? There isn't any. This is exactly what God is. I've now become the god of this village."

The woman held the glass sphere before Shirone's eyes.

"God is ultimately nothing more than a designer capable of creating a dimension one level lower than the dimension they inhabit. Yet why does God feel like an absolute being? This is the interesting part. This farmer won't feel that some force acted upon him when he moved to the nearby field."

The woman drew the glass sphere back and supported it with both palms. When she spread her arms wide, the village instantly expanded and covered the temple.

Shirone looked around. Before he knew it, he was inside the village. The two people stood at opposite ends of a path, facing each other. The other people still weren't moving.

The woman approached the farmer who was working the field.

"This farmer doesn't know how imperfect the world I created is. Because he was born here. There's only one way to know."

"Immortal Function."

"Correct. Immortal Function expands the senses to the whole. This village is contained within a glass sphere. So it's no exaggeration to say there's no world beyond the glass sphere."

The woman touched the farmer's shoulder. The farmer transformed into light and covered the entire sky. In that state, when the woman extended her fist, the scenery contracted and the entire village was contained in the glass sphere again.

Shirone quietly gazed at the glass sphere. It was filled with light that had spread from the farmer.

"This farmer expanded to the whole through Immortal Function. But even so, he cannot perceive my existence. The same goes for you, Shirone."

Shirone felt the farmer's situation wasn't someone else's problem. If the woman hadn't attempted hijacking, he too would have dispersed into meaningless light.

"What do you want from me? What can I do just because I know such facts?"

"This is it, Shirone."

The woman placed the glass sphere between her palms and crushed it. The glass sphere contracted and compressed into a black dot.

"Spot..."

"Yes. This is the true nature of the world we live in. The world you inhabit is ultimately just a single point. But when you go inside, an infinite world unfolds. It's the spacetime matrix."

The woman demonstrated directly. The glass sphere's scenery disappeared into a point, then a new world was born. A world within a world, and then another world within that... Then when she pressed her palms together, the glass sphere vanished. Billions of worlds were annihilated in an instant.

"Please enter the spacetime I created. Create your own spacetime there. That way, a perfect universe will be born."

For some reason, she seemed to want innovation in her world. It wasn't a particularly distasteful proposal. If he could become the god of another world as compensation for accepting death, it would be a decent ending.

"I cannot do that."

The woman asked back as if she couldn't understand.

"Why? There's no justification or reason to refuse."

"Because if I enter your spacetime, I would have to sacrifice another person like me again."

A flash of sadness briefly crossed the woman's eyes. But the emotional change was momentary, and she soon returned to a cold expression and spoke to Shirone.

"What does that matter? It's a world you created anyway."

"But you're not a god."

For the first time, hostility arose in the woman's eyes.

"You're a human inhabiting the same world as me. The proof is that you brought me here before I was completely decomposed. If you were truly a god, shouldn't you exist outside the world?"

The woman didn't deny it. Not that it changed the outcome.

"Shirone, you must follow my words. There was a purpose in calling you. If you're going to refuse, I could put you through the decomposition process even now."

It was a mind reconstructed by the woman's ability. So reversing it might also be at her discretion. But as long as there was even the slightest possibility of returning to the original world, Shirone had no intention of obediently following.

"I won't be decomposed."

The woman extended her hand toward Shirone and cast the omnipotence of decomposition. But Shirone wasn't decomposed. Because he had already entered Spirit Zone.

"You've solved another problem. An excellent choice."

The woman's arm slowly lowered.

"Now I understand. Spirit Zone was also a spot."

Spots could be infinitely delved into according to the principle of the spacetime matrix. This was why Shirone, as a mental entity, could enter Spirit Zone again.

"And this place... is your Spirit Zone."

Shirone concentrated his light energy. The woman frowned in displeasure. The crimson radiance rising from Shirone's body was pressing down on her with an ominous aura.

The fifth day since Shirone's death.

All the students had regained their memories. The children were especially confused. But since they too were prodigies with exceptional mental strength compared to ordinary people, the aftereffects weren't as severe as expected.

However, the real difficulty was just beginning.

The incident of the school being occupied by monsters revealed the vulnerability of security facilities. Especially for a school operating a dormitory system, safety had to be the top priority consideration in regulations.

The biggest problem was that there had been a death among the students. And it was Arian Shirone, who had been expected as the school's promising student.

At Iruki and Nade's request, Shirone was in the infirmary rather than the morgue. Common sense dictated that a funeral should be held, but even the faculty were reading the atmosphere.

The reason there was still no movement from the student council to assign responsibility was that no death certificate had been issued for Shirone.

In the end, they were devising a plan to avoid responsibility by keeping Shirone in limbo.

Of course, there were quite a few teachers who felt guilty about this approach. They were currently gathered in the faculty meeting room, emphasizing the urgency of the situation.

"We must hold Shirone's funeral immediately. We need to inform his guardians too. If we don't handle this now, the school's policy will face criticism later."

"This isn't something to decide lightly. If word spreads that a student died, the repercussions will be enormous. We could lose all the reputation we've built up in an instant."

"So you're saying we should lie that a dead student is alive? It's bound to be discovered eventually! What the school needs to do now is make a conscientious declaration. It's not about reputationâ€”the school might have to close down."

"Who doesn't know that? We're just saying let's take a little more time to think about it."

"Why don't you understand that dragging it out makes things more disadvantageous? Currently, Arcane's disciples are also missing. Letting criminals escape is also a fatal matter. We need to act now."

The teachers currently delaying Shirone's funeral were divided into two groups. Those making political calculations wanted to drag out time as much as possible while managing the students' anger.

On the other hand, there were teachers who truly couldn't accept Shirone's death. Notably, Ethella and Thad, who had been directly involved at the scene, and Siena were also in the position of doubting Shirone's death.

"Principal, please say something! I heard the student council is being convened today. The faculty must also take action."

The faculty's impatience was also greatly influenced by the student council. If students backed by numerous families began to file complaints against the school, they would miss the opportunity to take action.

"I'm in favor of waiting and seeing."

Most of the teachers rose up in protest.

"Principal!"

Alpheas understood their feelings. The longer they delayed, the more disadvantageous it became for the school. But he had something more important than the school's survival. Shirone's exact condition.

Was Shirone dead?

It was an absurd agenda for a magic school, the symbol of intelligence, to propose.

That's why he was even more cautious. Would he have had such doubts if the dead person hadn't been Shirone?

'I need to think rationally. But I cannot.'

Perhaps only Shirone was receiving special treatment. But even knowing this fact, Alpheas couldn't abandon the subtle feeling lodged in a corner of his mind.
