"I don't want to make hasty judgments about Shirone's situation. We currently lack sufficient information about Unlockers."

Ethella, who shared Alpheas's opinion, added her thoughts.

"Shirone entered the Immortal Function three months ago. And in this recent battle, he opened it to an extreme degree. The monastery recognizes the Immortal Function as a process of spiritual sublimation. Perhaps this might be an issue separate from life itself."

"What are you talking about? We're not here to listen to the monastery's perspective. We want to resolve this situation as quickly as possible."

Some teachers couldn't understand Ethella's words. The Immortal Function wasn't a level but a realm. No matter how deeply learned a teacher might be, they couldn't confidently claim to be more profound than a street beggar when it came to the domain of enlightenment.

The teacher who had rebuked Ethella spoke directly to Alpheas.

"Headmaster, please reconsider. If I may be frank, this situation began with your personal grudges. Nothing is more important to us than the school. At this rate, the worst-case scenario might unfold."

Alpheas looked around at the assembly. Dozens of eyes were applying silent pressure.

"The worst-case scenario? What exactly do you consider to be the worst-case scenario?"

"A school closure order might be issued."

"No, that's not the worst-case scenario."

One teacher struck his chest in frustration as he spoke.

"I cannot understand the Headmaster's intentions. What could possibly be worse than the school closing down?"

"For a school, the worst-case scenario would be if all the students and teachers had died."

The conference room fell into silence. The gazes that had been focused on Alpheas began to drift away one by one.

"If it weren't for Shirone, no one would have survived. And your names would have been on that list of the dead as well."

Alpheas was disappointed by the teachers' attitude of trying to exploit rather than honor a student's death.

"Isn't there still a glimmer of possibility? Even if it's less than one percent, isn't this a child who sacrificed his life for us? Then shouldn't we at least try until we've exhausted every option? Even if the school closes, isn't it our duty as teachers to do our best for Shirone's survival?"

"But Headmaster, what does this school mean to us? We feel sorry for Shirone too, but if we close down like this..."

"The school won't close. I'll take full responsibility for everything. So please do your best for Shirone. Don't we owe the child at least this much sacrifice?"

The teachers couldn't argue against Alpheas's words. Regardless of the reasons, it was an undeniable fact that they had been saved by a student's life.

Thus the meeting ended, and the teachers left the conference room with dark expressions.

The Magic School Student Council.

In the massive conference room, student council representatives from each class had gathered. Unlike the teachers who worried about their livelihoods, these emotionally sensitive students felt betrayed by Alpheas's past.

"Good day. I am Amira, the student council president. I have called this meeting to reach an agreement regarding this recent incident. I hope you will all offer constructive opinions."

Amira from Class Two declared the meeting open from the podium. Majoring in climate magic, she was twenty-two years old this year and belonged to the top tier of graduation candidates—a true prodigy.

As a representative left-leaning figure in the student council, one could predict the atmosphere of the debate. As expected, the first to request speaking rights were the conservatives who supported the school's position.

"I'm Seriel from Class Three. I understand that criticism of Headmaster Alpheas is severe within the school. However, I believe we must be cautious. The school's honor is the same as the students' honor. Attacking the faculty in this situation could have negative repercussions for future graduates."

"I'm Cas from Class Four. While Committee Member Seriel's opinion has merit, this matter concerns the morality of our teachers. Even if it happened forty years ago, it was criminal behavior. If we don't take clear responsibility for this, I believe the school has no future."

Naturally, Amira agreed with Cas's opinion. However, befitting her role as chairperson, she didn't reveal this outwardly and merely nodded.

"I'm Olivia from Class Six. The main issue at present is whether Shirone is dead or alive. As we know, Shirone is dead. However, a minority of students and teachers are distorting this fact. Because of this, the school has let two suspects who collaborated with Arcane escape, and the headmaster's prosecution is also being delayed. This is clear evasion of responsibility, and I believe the student council must step forward."

Amira was angry for the same reason. Currently, the teachers were delaying Alpheas's prosecution on the grounds that Shirone's condition was uncertain.

Seriel countered.

"Aren't you over-interpreting the faculty's intentions? Shirone's heart isn't beating, but decomposition isn't progressing either. I understand that considerable discussion is taking place in the Ivory Tower regarding the opening of the Immortal Function. Considering these factors, the faculty's judgment isn't incomprehensible."

The students reacted lukewarmly. Since even the teachers found the Immortal Function difficult to understand, there was no way they could accept it at their level. Some students didn't even know what the Immortal Function was.

Amira felt the same way. The highest realm that a magician could pursue. But so what?

Magic was a knowledge-based phenomenon. No matter how much they talked about chasing clouds and claimed this was the ultimate achievement, she couldn't grasp what was so remarkable about it.

"Um, I'm Veronica from Class Ten."

An eight-year-old child raised her hand. Since the student council elected representatives by class, even being young didn't diminish the weight of her voice.

"Yes. Please speak, Committee Member Veronica."

"What did Grandpa Alpheas do wrong?"

At the voice that seemed ready to burst into tears, Amira frowned and sighed.

'This is why I suggested separating by class.'

Veronica sniffled as she spoke.

"Even if Grandpa Alpheas did something wrong, can't we forgive him?"

"That's not possible, Committee Member Veronica. This is a matter concerning the school's honor."

"But... everyone makes mistakes, don't they?"

The meeting hall stirred. This statement certainly caused significant waves. At this unexpected gain, the conservatives listened to Veronica's words while observing how the situation would unfold.

"I get scolded by my mom a lot too. But she doesn't scold me too harshly. She said everyone can make mistakes. Grandpa Alpheas made a mistake, but he's led the school well all this time. So can't we forgive him?"

Mark, seeing an opportunity, raised his hand and stood up.

"I'm Mark from Class Seven. I also agree with Committee Member Veronica's words. Of course, those who commit crimes should naturally be punished. However, I believe it would also be overstepping our bounds for us, who have trusted the school's security and advocated maintaining the status quo, to take an aggressive stance. As long as the faculty doesn't intend to condone the situation, I think the student council also needs the wisdom to wait."

'Well done, Mark.'

When Seriel gave a thumbs up under the table, Mark nodded in response to signal back.

As the atmosphere reversed, opinions became evenly matched.

Amira predicted votes through each person's statements. Overall, the lower classes sided with the school while the graduating class criticized it. The votes from the advanced classes were split fifty-fifty.

'At this rate, we might lose.'

This way, there would be no method to prosecute Alpheas. She needed to somehow seize an opportunity for reversal, but the relatively younger lower classes tended to be swayed by emotions, making it difficult to extinguish the fire.

"I'm Ardino Fermi from Class One."

When Fermi, who had only been listening until now, raised his hand, everyone's attention focused on him. As the number one in the graduating class and the top graduation candidate, it was natural to be curious about his thoughts.

Seriel anxiously observed Fermi. A young man with neatly combed dark brown hair wearing businesslike formal clothes. However, beneath his authoritative appearance lurked a wicked sense of mischief.

He had the ability to graduate but somehow always failed. He had been considered likely for the next student council president position but ultimately abstained, passing the position to Amira.

Honestly, she didn't know what he was thinking. The only thing she knew was that he enjoyed causing trouble and relished universal conflict.

"Everyone here owes a debt to Shirone. Without him, we would all be dead by now. Therefore, there are surely those who cannot accept his death."

The students became solemn. They too knew how hard Shirone had fought for all the students.

But Seriel became anxious instead. As far as she knew, Fermi wasn't the type to feel gratitude toward anyone. She couldn't understand why he was suddenly bringing up this topic.

"I too am grateful to Shirone. But the faculty is using such a Shirone as a shield. Therefore, our judgment is not overstepping bounds. It's a struggle to protect Shirone's spirit."

"What do you mean protect his spirit? Shirone isn't dead yet...!"

"It's already been five days. Shirone's heart isn't beating. None of you here would deny missing Shirone. Isn't that right?"

Most nodded. Even if they didn't think so, mourning someone's death wasn't particularly difficult.

"Everyone misses Shirone and is grateful to him. Then let me ask again. Is there anyone here who truly believes Shirone is alive?"

Seriel realized Fermi's strategy. When emotion and reason are separated, guilt disappears and reality becomes clearer. The students would judge coldly.

"Of course, no one thinks so. It's not cruel—it's common sense. Yet the teachers still insist Shirone is alive. Like a pseudo-religious cult."

Seriel slammed the table and stood up.

"That's not true! Clearly, there's something strange about Shirone's condition...!"

"What exactly is strange? I've read the reports on the Immortal Function. But magical realms have nothing to do with a living being's death. I've also obtained intelligence that Shirone's body has already been embalmed."

"Th-that's...!"

It was Alpheas's order. If the Immortal Function involved the mind, then physical deterioration needed to be managed here—it was foresight.

But she couldn't understand how Fermi had accessed this secret known only to a few.

Amira's eyes flashed sharply as she asked.

"Embalmed? Is Committee Member Fermi's statement true?"

Seriel glared at Fermi. Seeing his innocent smile made her even more irritated.

'That nasty kid. He has nothing to do with this. He just wants to cause trouble.'

"Committee Member Seriel, please answer."

Seriel sighed. A fight she could have won had become uncertain due to a moment's mistake.

"I exercise my right to remain silent. If you want answers beyond this, please formally convene a hearing."

While remaining silent implied affirmation, it was worlds apart from speaking the words directly. The importance of the right to silence lay in leaving room for rebuttal. Since no one knew what variables might reverse the situation, there was no need to foolishly drive in the wedge prematurely.

Amira didn't drag out the time. If this was a reversal upon reversal, now was the optimal point. After concluding the meeting, she proceeded to the vote.

"We will now begin the secret ballot."

The result was... as Seriel had expected.

* * *

"Alpheas must resign! Submit to the inspection department's investigation!"

"Hold Shirone's funeral! Playing with the dead is not something a teacher should do!"

About a hundred students who had joined the student council's decision were holding pickets and protesting in front of the infirmary.
