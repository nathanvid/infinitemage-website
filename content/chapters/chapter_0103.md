Amira, standing at the front, rallied the students.

"The school must reveal the full truth of this incident! Only by prosecuting Principal Alpheas can we guarantee the future of our magic school!"

"That's right! Alpheas must resign! Hold Shirone's funeral!"

Their shouting carried through the infirmary window to Amy's group. Just then, the door burst open as Seriel entered.

"Amy, this is terrible!"

"What's going on? Why are they suddenly acting like this?"

Amy's confusion was understandable. She thought the student council meeting was ending, but suddenly they had gathered demanding Shirone's funeral be held.

"The graduating class students are conspiring to report the principal. I thought we could at least protect Shirone, but that bastard Fermi stirred up trouble..."

Amy could understand the situation without seeing it. Fermi was certainly capable of such behavior. It seemed the student council had ultimately decided on the principal's resignation. But she couldn't blame them for being heartless. If the school's leader had moral defects, it would be better for the future to clean house.

But it was too extreme. That's why Fermi's behavior was so irritating. While the lukewarm response from the faculty had triggered the student council's anger, it was ultimately Fermi who lit the fuse.

"That terrible boy. He owes his life to Shirone too."

"What do we do now, Amy?"

Amy bit her nails as she spoke.

"What else can we do? We have to hold out."

Alpheas had said to watch over Shirone for the time being. That he, as the person ultimately responsible for this incident, had convinced the teachers was already miraculous.

Nade, who had been watching out the window, turned to Iruki with a sharp look.

"Are you satisfied now? There's a whole crowd of kids out there thinking the same as you. Shouldn't you be out there with them?"

"I could do that if you want."

Iruki shot back without backing down. The two had remained awkward since their fight that day.

Seriel frowned as she spoke.

"Stop it, both of you. Fighting among ourselves won't solve anything. Now's the time to join forces."

"Tch! You think this bastard Iruki will join forces? He's completely heartless."

"I said stop it. And Iruki, you need to be careful too. The situation has become really serious. Since we don't know how public opinion might change with a single word, stay here for now."

"I wasn't planning to leave anyway."

Iruki buried his face in the table, lost in thought. It had already been five days since Shirone died. Things were taking much longer than he had expected.

'If the student council has moved, the faculty won't last much longer either. About 48 hours from now...'

The atmosphere in the infirmary rapidly turned cold. Everyone was overly sensitive, tormented by this situation.

Amy stroked Shirone's forehead. Logically, he should be considered dead. But was their current situation of clinging to hope really normal?

'Please, please come back, Shirone...'

Amy couldn't be certain of Shirone's survival. But with his heart stopped for five days now, the realm of certainty had already passed. From now on, it was the realm of faith.

The woman watched intently at the red light emanating from Shirone's body. With the principle of releasing high energy to vibrate particles, any object could be destroyed.

"Shirone, don't do this. That magic is far too destructive. It doesn't suit your nature."

"I don't want to fight either. But you intend to keep me trapped here. I can't allow that. I have to return."

"Do you think you can win against me?"

Shirone shook his head. It was his honest feeling. Even if they were beings of the same dimension, she was strong enough to call herself a god. At the very least, she had to be considered higher than the Arcane level.

Who exactly was this woman? And where was this place?

Shirone stopped thinking. At least this wasn't where he should be.

"Please teach me how to return to the original world."

"Even if I taught you, it wouldn't be possible. That would only drive you to death once again."

"Even so, I think I have to try."

The woman wasn't afraid of Shirone's magic. But the laser's power wasn't something to take lightly. She had to prevent this world from being destroyed at all costs.

"Fine. I'll do as you wish. But promise me this: if you can't return to your original world and come back, then follow my will."

"What's the method for returning?"

"I can't compromise any further. Will you still do it?"

Whatever terrifying obstacles lay ahead that made her threaten him, Shirone's thoughts didn't change.

"Alright. But I will never give up."

"Your life is yours. Use it as you see fit."

The woman created a glass sphere before Shirone's eyes. Inside, pitch-black darkness was rotating.

"Shirone. To return to your original world, you must reverse the process by which you came here."

"I see."

"Don't think it will be easy. It's the process of returning from pure spirit to human. Humans are collections of all kinds of unpleasant elements. If you can't accept this, you'll end up transformed into something strange that's neither human nor anything else."

The woman was confident in Shirone's failure.

"The darkness you see now is a spot that penetrates space-time. It's commonly called a black hole. Through this, you can return to your original world."

The glass sphere vanished as enormous darkness appeared before Shirone.

"What do I need to do?"

"It's simple. Just enter it. It's a spot connected to your physical body."

"Thank you. I won't forget this kindness."

Shirone was sincere. Though he had been hijacked here, without her he wouldn't have even had a chance to return to his original world.

"Don't give premature thanks. I absolutely don't think you'll succeed. If you want to give up, just walk back this way."

Would such a situation really come? He felt like he'd rather die than come back, but since he hadn't experienced it yet, Shirone didn't make premature judgments.

"Then I'll be going."

The woman spoke with sleepy, narrowed eyes.

"Have a good journey."

Shirone took his first step into the sphere. The feeling was similar to when he first entered the spot. As expected, Shirone couldn't find an exit. No matter how much he walked, nothing changed.

Shirone was startled when he casually looked back. The woman was still watching him with sleepy eyes. Time wasn't flowing. He was trapped in the event horizon that only occurs under extreme gravity.

'I can't escape. Getting out of here is absolutely impossible.'

Shirone finally understood the woman's words. In a place where even time couldn't escape, there was nothing he could do.

Being clever, he was quick to face reality. Shirone turned around with a miserable heart. He had to return to her. Rather than being trapped in darkness forever, shouldn't he at least live where there was another person?

'Wait. Maybe...'

Shirone suddenly stopped walking. At the event horizon, time is held forever. But he had the ability to generate time. That was photonization magic.

Sub-light speed, near-light speed, light speed, faster-than-light speed.

These were the four speeds classified by photon mages. By Shirone's calculations, faster-than-light speed was needed to pass through the event horizon.

'Faster-than-light speed... is it really possible?'

Shirone's level was at most sub-light speed. Adding divine particles might make near-light speed possible, but that was still far from faster-than-light speed.

'Let me think.'

Since he had found a method, time wasn't a problem. After long contemplation, his eyes changed. He could do it. Without a physical body, reaching faster-than-light speed might be possible now.

'Immortal Function.'

Even at light speed, traveling the vast universe was impossible. But infinite expansion speed was instantaneous. Perhaps Immortal Function was the key to reaching faster-than-light speed.

Anyway, returning was the priority. Shirone took a deep breath and cast photonization magic while simultaneously opening Immortal Function.

The effect appeared immediately. The vibration accelerating through sub-light speed, near-light speed, and light speed was strong enough to collapse his Spirit Zone.

"Ughhhhh...!"

Still, he couldn't reach faster-than-light speed. Unless he could understand being faster than time itself, casting magic through omniscience was impossible. What remained was the complete opening of Immortal Function. Though it might lead to another unknown world of annihilation, he expanded his consciousness to its entirety without hesitation.

Shirone's form burst apart, decomposing into particles. Finally, something faster than light began racing toward the light, crossing the event horizon.

'I did it!'

Shirone still maintained his consciousness. Even with Immortal Function completely open, no particles were scattered within the black hole. He could see the exit in the distance. His physical body was waiting there.

'I'm going! Finally, I'm going!'

Then suddenly, his speed began to decrease. Particles of unknown meaning stuck between Shirone's particles. The particles created meaning through combination and acted like voices, confusing Shirone's mind.

-Consumption. Consumption. Consumption. Consumption. Consumption. Consumption. Consumption. Consumption.

-Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction.

Shirone watched the exit growing distant as he became heavier. As the particles complexly intertwined, simple meanings evolved into higher-dimensional meanings.

-Ah, birth. The lowest existence.

-I don't want to die. The life of mortals.

Shirone realized this was the process of becoming human that the woman had mentioned. A being thrown into the world carrying both desire and fear.

Perhaps all humans heard such voices in their mother's womb?

"I won't give in! I will definitely return!"

-Where to? There's nowhere that welcomes you.

"To my world! Where my friends are waiting!"

-They'll kill you. They'll interfere with consumption and reproduction. What awaits you is only the collision of desires, painful struggle, and the journey to inevitable death.

"Ahhhhh! I can't hear anything! No words can stop me!"

Shirone shouted desperately. But as the combination progressed, the floating voices grew louder.

Humans were ultimately beings composed of countless voices. Like a solo being buried in a chorus, Shirone eventually lost his own voice.

-Consumption. Consumption. Consumption. Consumption. Consumption. Consumption. Consumption. Consumption.

-Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction. Reproduction.

* * *

The seventh day of Shirone's death.

The student council was still protesting. More precisely, it was the radical figures following Amira.

In opposition, conservative students blocked the entrance, preventing access. As the moderate faction also split into factions, the total number of protesters doubled.

Most of the entire student body had gathered in front of the building, and their day-and-night protests were driving Shirone's protecting friends to the edge of nervous breakdown.

"Execute Shirone's funeral!"

"Execute! Execute!"

"Let Alpheas face judgment from the Magic Association!"

"Face judgment! Face judgment!"

Seriel covered her ears. Though the sound wasn't loud with the windows closed, she couldn't bear to hear any more.

"Isn't this going too far? Why are they so obsessed with not letting Shirone be?"

At Seriel's words, Amy, who had been dozing with her face buried in the auxiliary bed, raised her head.

"Those kids have their own position too. Some who usually disliked Shirone probably joined in."

"Is it Shirone's fault for being outstanding? It's their own narrow-mindedness."

"All humans are like that. If there are people who acknowledge Shirone, naturally there will be those who reject him too."
