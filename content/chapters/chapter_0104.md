Iruki, who had been slumped over the table, spoke up.

"Did you achieve some kind of enlightenment in the meantime? Just yesterday you were saying you'd chase after them and beat them up."

Amy didn't even have the energy to get angry. Iruki was probably feeling the same way. After a week of stress, she didn't want to lift even a finger.

Amy rested her chin on the bed and said, "Now that things have gotten this far, I understand. At least there are people fighting for Shirone right now."

Nade, who had been watching the protest from the window, chimed in.

"Even so, our side is mostly lower-class students or advanced class students. On the other hand, most of those protesting are from the graduating class. If they really storm in, we won't be able to stop them."

Seriel said, "Still, we should be fine for now. We have the faculty on our side. The headmaster too, and Siena and Ethella are also on our side."

"You don't know because you haven't seen it, senior. Those people... their behavior has been suspicious since yesterday."

"Huh? In what way?"

Seriel turned to look at Nade, but it was Iruki who answered.

"It seems like some of them are missing. It's especially strange that Amira and Fermi are absent. At least one of them should have stayed behind to incite the crowd."

Amy flared up and shouted, "Hey! Why do you speak formally to Seriel but keep talking casually to me?"

Iruki turned his gaze away as if annoyed. There was no particular reason anyway. He had simply thought that if she was Shirone's girlfriend, she was his friend too.

The infirmary door opened and Alpheas entered, accompanied by Siena and Ethella. The persistence of the student council was wearing down the teachers' faces day by day.

"You've all had a hard time. How is Shirone?"

"As you can see... he's the same."

"I see. It can't be helped."

Even Alpheas was beginning to have doubts. A week had already passed. If some absolute being appeared and said Shirone would come back to life, he could wait a year or even ten years. But the problem was that no one could prove that Shirone would return alive. It was a race against time.

"I'll cast magic on Shirone."

Amy and Seriel made way for him. Alpheas placed his hand on Shirone's chest and cast Slow magic. It was an embalming process that could be done without harming the body.

After finishing the magic, Alpheas stepped back again. Now Shirone would be able to last another day.

But until when? Right now the teachers were quietly watching, but as time passed, voices of dissatisfaction would inevitably arise.

Siena stared intently at Shirone before stroking his head. The more she thought about it, the more unfair and heartbreaking it was. For a promising young magician to end up like this before he could even bloom.

'That's why I said I should have stopped him.'

Shirone had successfully overcome Overflow. But what he gained in return was frequent contact with Immortal Function. At the time, Ethella had said she would take full responsibility. She had no desire to criticize now. If something went wrong with Shirone, she would spend her entire life consoling his spirit.

"Teacher! Something terrible has happened!"

Seriel shouted. Amy and Nade were also looking out the window, unable to hide their anger. Siena walked to the window. Amira and Fermi, who hadn't been visible until yesterday, were holding up documents toward the infirmary.

"On behalf of the students of Alpheas Magic School, we will submit a lawsuit against all teachers! Please allow us to take custody of Headmaster Alpheas!"

Siena felt her head throb. The thing they had feared had finally happened. The student council had played their trump card. It meant they would force punishment not only on Alpheas but on the other teachers as well.

Once the lawsuit was filed, the situation would spiral out of control. If the students' families got involved, the school would collapse beyond any hope of recovery.

When Siena opened the window, the protesters instantly fell silent.

"What is all this commotion about? Is inciting students and shaking up the school what the student council should be doing?"

Amira walked toward the window.

"This isn't incitement. We don't want to go this far either. That's why we haven't submitted the lawsuit yet. But there are too many questionable points. It's already been seven days since Shirone died. Yet none of the faculty is willing to announce it publicly."

"Shirone isn't dead. He's just fallen into a comatose state."

"There's no such thing as a comatose state where the heart doesn't beat. We also can't understand why decomposition isn't progressing. Wouldn't Headmaster Alpheas's magic make that entirely possible?"

The student council seemed to have reached that conclusion. It was an accurate prediction.

But there are things in the world that shouldn't be judged by results alone. The student council didn't understand why Shirone had to be embalmed.

The root of the problem was Immortal Function. Even magic school students knew nothing about the realm of nirvana, so they could only respond emotionally.

"It's exactly as you think. Currently, Shirone is being preserved from decay using Slow magic."

Siena readily admitted it. Not only the student council but even the opposition students blocking the entrance began to stir.

"Are you admitting to the charges?"

"You're being hasty, Amira. The word 'charges' can only be used when the teachers planned to use Shirone as a shield to escape."

"You're right, teacher. But currently we haven't heard any circumstantial evidence to judge that. The student council cannot understand the faculty's response."

"The faculty has not acknowledged Shirone's death. We also have no intention of escaping. That's why we're asking for your understanding."

"Teacher, Shirone's death is sad for us too. But the student council doesn't want to see our precious alma mater fall apart like this."

"I understand that you currently cannot trust the teachers. But we've also thought carefully and made the best decision. Whether you believe that or not is up to your judgment."

Amira pondered Siena's words. She couldn't rule out the possibility that the teachers knew something she had missed. Humans are beings who believe what they think is right, after all.

But no matter how many times she thought about it, she couldn't understand. Shirone was already dead. No, honestly, whether he was dead or alive, just the fact that all the teachers were protecting him made her feel irritated.

'Is this the right path? Am I in a rational state? What if Shirone actually comes back to life? But that could never happen...'

If it weren't for her position as student council president, Amira wouldn't want to go as far as filing a lawsuit either. But if she backed down, the students would bear all the consequences.

Fermi, who had been watching, didn't like seeing Amira in conflict. Thinking that the situation might collapse at this rate, he decided to step forward himself.

"So we can't find a compromise after all. Then we have no choice but to use our final method."

Siena looked at Fermi with an unpleasant expression. In her four years of teaching, she had never encountered a student like him. He was someone who possessed outstanding talent yet was even more skilled at hiding it.

He worshipped falsehood and enjoyed using that power to control situations. This might also be an ability needed by magicians, but it wasn't a quality students should possess.

"Hmph, go ahead and file your lawsuit or don't, do whatever you want. In the end, you'll be the ones regretting it."

"Fine, let's do that! First we'll retrieve Shirone's body and proceed with the lawsuit! Come on! We'll rescue Shirone with our own power!"

Fermi led the graduating class students forward toward the infirmary. No one could stop them now that they were caught up in mob mentality.

"Let's hold a funeral for Shirone and report the teachers! The owners of the school are the students, not the teachers!"

"Wait! Please don't do this!"

The Shirone faction students led by Maria blocked their way. But they couldn't achieve much effect and the path quickly opened. Fermi's side consisted mostly of graduating class students who were like gods to them. If it came to force, numerical advantage would be meaningless.

"Isn't this going too far? This is still about a fellow student's life!"

Mark stood his ground blocking the path with his characteristic determination. But to the godlike graduating class students, a Class Seven underclassman wasn't even worth talking to.

At that moment, a window shattered on the third floor. As the fragments fell, students rushed back. Nade jumped down from the building. As the wind from Fly magic pushed away the dust on the ground, the protesters frowned.

Nade slowly raised his head, his eyes burning with murderous intent.

"All of you get lost, before I kill you. No one can lay a finger on Shirone."

Now that things had reached this point, Amira also abandoned her thoughts and moved to action. The water had already been spilled, and if they lost in momentum, they would lose public opinion too.

"What are you doing? Don't you know that throwing a tantrum won't solve anything? And telling seniors you'll kill them? Where did you learn such language?"

Nade couldn't hear any words. He only thought about protecting Shirone.

"You want to take Shirone away? Then come at me, all of you. But I can't guarantee your lives."

A bluish bolt appeared above Nade's head and scattered powerful lightning around him. It was the lightning magic Lightning. But what was more terrifying than that was the plasma rising from Nade.

Amira showed signs of panic and backed away.

'How can an advanced class student use plasma...'

To cast plasma magic, one had to either construct an ultra-high temperature battery or implement virtual ultra-high temperatures through omnipotence.

But since the former method hadn't been developed yet, all plasma magicians belonged to the latter category, and since it couldn't be learned through theory alone, it was that much more difficult to reach such a realm.

Iruki looked down at Nade with an unpleasant expression.

'Stupid fool. After enduring it all this time.'

Iruki was the only person on campus who knew Nade's past. Just five years ago, Nade had been a completely different person. But he had resolved never to show his true face again and wore a mask. Now he had cast off that mask. All to protect Shirone.

'This makes me feel a bit sorry.'

Iruki smiled bitterly and turned around. Then he slipped out of the infirmary unnoticed, as if he had never been there.

The protesters were quite flustered. Even the graduating class had someone called Lightning Monster Lycon, so they knew how dangerous plasma was.

Nade glared at Amira and said, "This is my final warning. Get lost."

"Why are you going this far? What meaning does protecting a friend who's already dead have for you?"

"Shirone isn't dead."

Nade shed tears with his eyes wide open.

"What do you know, you insignificant thing? What do you know about Shirone to talk so carelessly!"

Seeing Nade's tears, Amira felt sorry for him. But she had no intention of backing down.

"If you want a physical confrontation, I can't just stand by either. I'll subdue you first before the students get hurt."

Amira took a step back and gathered both fists at her core. Grayish-white clouds began to billow up and swirl around her. It was Cloud magic, a type of weather magic. It had excellent compatibility with electricity. No, at Amira's level, she could probably charge Nade's electricity into the clouds and send it back at him.

"Anyway... why do something you can't handle the consequences of?"

Iruki walked out from the entrance. Nade frowned. What was he appearing for now to interfere? But the place Iruki stopped was next to Nade, not Amira.

"What? Don't interfere. This is my fight."

"But from now on, it's my fight too."

"Weren't you on their side?"

Nade's tone was blunt. Though there was no lingering resentment between the friends, there was no reason for Iruki, who judged that Shirone was dead, to get involved in this battle.
