"What's with taking sides instead of mourning? I'm serious too. I don't want those bastards taking Shirone away."

Amira wore an incredulous expression. While their desire to protect a friend was admirable, they were only advanced class students. There was no way they could fight against this side, most of whom were from the graduating class.

"Do you really think you're something special just because we've been going easy on you? Do you think you can win against us?"

Starting with Amira, all the protesters entered their Spirit Zones. The powerful zones of graduating class level were transmitted to Nade and Iruki through synesthesia.

'Keke. Kekekeke.'

Fermi, watching their confrontation, secretly shrugged his shoulders. The current situation was so amusing he could die from laughter.

'Yes. Fight, fight. Break yourselves apart to your heart's content.'

Fermi knew that all profit was created from chaos and conflict. In that sense, war was the ultimate blue ocean. Wealth accumulation was impossible unless a few winners exploited many losers.

Fermi knew how to win wars. Cut away emotions. Human weakness ultimately lay in emotions. Those who exploit others' emotions rule the world.

'Grieve. Rage. Shout that only you are right. That's how you raise the stakes. Of course, I'll be taking all those stakes.'

From the infirmary, Siena's gaze locked onto Fermi as she observed the situation.

'This is all your doing, you wretched bastard.'

She was furious but couldn't condemn him. Fermi's philosophy was no half-measure either. Perhaps Fermi was even exploiting the situation Shirone found himself in.

Alpheas approached Siena's side.

"There's nothing to be done now."

"Headmaster."

"This seems to be the end. Accept the student council's demands."

Amy shouted.

"Headmaster! No! What about Shirone then?"

"Amy, I'm sorry."

"How can you do this! Headmaster, you know! You know Shirone isn't dead yet!"

"No. Actually, I'm not sure."

Shocked Amy froze in place. Alpheas placed his hand on her shoulder and spoke.

"Amy, no one can know Shirone's condition. We're simply believing. I too believe that Shirone will return."

"But then why..."

"But look. Now even unrelated children are fighting, aren't they? It doesn't matter how this happened. I cannot let the situation where my students are fighting continue any longer."

To Alpheas, other students were as precious as Shirone. Those students were now spreading Spirit Zones to kill each other. In this situation, caring only for Shirone would be selfish.

"I'll go down and speak directly. Inform Shirone's parents and proceed with the funeral arrangements. We'll discuss disciplinary matters afterward."

Amy collapsed into a chair, strength leaving her body. Seriel approached with tears welling in her eyes.

"Amy, what do we do? Shirone, Shirone..."

Amy's heart felt no different. In the end, Shirone had not returned. The moment Alpheas acknowledged it, it felt as if Shirone had disappeared from her heart as well.

"Shirone..."

The atmosphere in front of the building was one step away from exploding. Everyone had their Spirit Zones deployed, and if anyone made the decision, they could cast lethal magic.

Amira felt doubt again. Was this truly the right path? Could schoolmates pointing Spirit Zones at each other and casting murderous magic take precedence over any logic?

She gnawed at her lips while looking back and forth between Nade and Iruki. Nade was already fully in battle stance, but Iruki seemed like there might still be room for dialogue.

"You're Iruki, right? The Servant ability user."

Iruki gave no response.

"Do we really have to do this? Your friend is too emotional. But you're different, aren't you?"

"Sorry, but I'm being emotional right now too."

"Lies. No, even if that's true, it doesn't matter. You know, don't you? Do you really think your friend is alive? Is that the conclusion you've reached?"

"Hmm, a conclusion. If that's the case, there's only one answer."

Iruki, who had been looking down lost in thought, glared at Amira and said.

"Shirone is not dead."

Nade looked back at Iruki with a surprised expression. He couldn't understand why the one who had claimed Shirone was dead until they were in the infirmary had suddenly changed his stance.

"Iruki, you..."

Iruki continued looking straight ahead. Amira's disappointment deepened. She had placed expectations on him as he was considered the most rational person in school, but in the end, he was just an advanced class kid.

"If you really think so, then you must have logic to convince us, right?"

"Of course."

Amira blinked for a moment. She couldn't believe the situation until she heard it.

"Then present your evidence. What's your reason for thinking Shirone is alive?"

"Because it's 4 o'clock now... should I put it that way?"

Dong. Dong. Dong. Dong.

The bell rang from the clock tower.

Measuring time without looking at a clock was possible because Iruki was a Servant. The method was simple. Starting from a certain point, count by seconds.

Nade realized why Iruki had been talking less lately.

'He was counting seconds. But from when exactly?'

Amira stared blankly at the clock tower. Then, realizing something, she turned her head.

"Now I get it. You're just crazy. What does time have to do with Shirone's death?"

Iruki gave no response. He thought there might be some error, but it was taking much longer than expected.

'4 o'clock 7 seconds. 8 seconds. 9 seconds. What the hell are you doing?'

Amira finished her thoughts. Her judgment was correct. Attempting dialogue with the emotional Nade and the originally crazy Iruki was pointless from the start.

"We're taking Shirone. Let's see how long you can hold out against the graduating class."

Murderous intent filled Nade's eyes at the aura emanating from the magic school's top students. Then a voice that wasn't familiar but was recognizable was heard.

"You're having fun playing around. How about letting me join in? This kind of thing is my specialty."

Everyone looked around. But they couldn't see who the voice belonged to. After a moment, two figures emerged from the shadows cast by the building. It was Canis and Arin.

Sparks flew from Amira's eyes.

"You people! How dare you come here! I'll have you arrested immediately!"

"Feel free if you can. We weren't planning to run anyway."

Canis responded with a snort and approached Iruki.

Iruki frowned as if annoyed.

"You're too late."

"You said to come by 4 o'clock?"

"You're 27 seconds late."

Canis felt frustrated but tried to calm his anger. Either way, settling their debt relationship came first.

"Here, what you asked for."

Iruki quickly received the documents Canis handed him and flipped through the pages. Only then did Nade, feeling puzzled, look at the documents and ask.

"Iruki, what's that?"

"Thunder Dragons' report. I sent Shirone's tissue sample for analysis."

"What? When exactly? No, more than that, how could it come from the capital in just 5 days?"

It was a distance that took 4 days even by carriage. Moreover, considering the time needed for Thunder Dragons to analyze it, the actual round trip time would have been within 48 hours.

"I asked Canis for help. He knows Bashka's geography inside and out."

Canis gritted his teeth remembering the hardships he'd endured. He had made it on time, but it was a journey where he prepared for death. During the day he took carriages, at night he used Dark Port to travel. Night travel was faster, but he had lost consciousness more than once or twice from exhausting his magic power to the limit.

"Anyway, with this, I don't owe Shirone any debt."

Canis felt no particular remorse about Shirone's death. But as a disciple, he held some sense of responsibility for Shirone being sacrificed due to Arcane's atrocities.

"Well, that's not my concern. Anyway, I'll tell Shirone that."

As the situation took a strange turn, Amira became anxious. Especially since Thunder Dragons was the kingdom's top organization headed by Iruki's father.

"What kind of scheme is this? Do you think we'll back down just because you're mercenaries?"

Mercenaries would certainly make one feel intimidated. But the families of the students gathered here were by no means insignificant either. If they pushed with numbers, it was a power struggle they could certainly handle.

"Don't worry about that. I used a false name. If my name appears, who knows what tricks that old man might pull. More importantly, isn't the content written in these documents what matters?"

"Ha! Is there some clause written about magic that brings the dead back to life?"

Iruki closed the documents and began reading from the beginning.

"Title. Report on Immortal Function and Suspension of Biological Activity."

The protesters flinched and closed their mouths upon hearing the title. The people in the third-floor infirmary also pricked up their ears to Iruki's continuing words.

"Analysis results of subject's tissue cell samples. Non-epidemiological death state. No transformation characteristic of organic matter found in samples taken 24 hours after death. Data attached."

Iruki moved to the next page.

"Based on the above data, while the subject can be considered to have ceased biological activity, extending this state to cessation of function, i.e., absence of life, would be unreasonable."

As if this was an important passage, Iruki emphasized it.

"Thunder Dragons classifies cardiac arrest into three cases. First, a state where cardiac function has stopped. Second, a state where cardiac function has temporarily stopped. Third, a state where the heart has not stopped but appears phenomenally to have stopped."

Amira shouted with an incredulous expression.

"What nonsense is that? I don't know about the first case, but the rest don't make sense!"

As if he expected this, Iruki turned to the next page.

"Case examples. While an organism can be considered dead when cardiac function stops, two new cases may occur specifically with Immortal Function."

In the quiet atmosphere, Iruki's voice rose.

"Case 1. When mental expansion is delayed due to a special event, the body may temporarily cease functioning until the mind reaches its conclusion. Report attached."

Iruki nodded as if understanding and read the next page.

"Case 2. Even if mental expansion has ended, the observer's time may differ. That is, a state where life activities are normal but external observation of those activities is impossible due to space-time barriers. Report attached."

Iruki felt no need to read further and flipped through pages rapidly to reach the final section.

"Based on the above magical academic opinion, the subject, that is, the one currently lying in the infirmary..."

The Thunder Dragons' report was thrust before the protesters' eyes.

"Arian Shirone cannot be considered dead."

All the protesters who had been making countless sounds until now maintained silence. They too, being mages, knew that no one could refute the opinion analyzed by Thunder Dragons.

"Iruki. When exactly did you..."

Iruki looked back at Nade, who wore a blank expression, and smiled.

"How's that? The method I found to bring the dead back to life."

Nade pursed his lips sheepishly. It really existed. A method to bring the dead back to life. While everyone was immersed in grief and harboring false hope, Iruki had been fighting alone and lonely.

"Go ahead, check for yourself."

Iruki handed the report to Amira. She received it silently and examined the first page of the report. Thunder Dragons' seal was clearly stamped there.

Further struggle was meaningless. The kingdom's top academic institution was proving that the teachers' judgment was correct. Even if they submitted a lawsuit, the courts would likely side with the school.

"You've worked hard, Amira."

Alpheas appeared at the building entrance.

"Headmaster."
