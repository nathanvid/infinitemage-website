Amira's firmly set eyes wavered for the first time. Even her steel-like resolve couldn't help but melt when faced with Alpheas's expression.

How could it not? This was someone she had followed since the days when she wet the bed.

"I'm sorry for putting you through such trouble."

Amira lowered her head and struggled to hold back the tears threatening to spill.

"It's not that I want to cause you pain, Headmaster. It's because the more respected someone is in the world, the less they should leave their mistakes uncovered. And if things continue like this, even the school will..."

"Why wouldn't I understand? I don't hate anyone here. You are all the future of this school."

Alpheas looked at Amira with pity. All the students gathered here were like foundlings he had raised himself. He was only sorry for causing them pain.

Raising her head again, Amira looked at Alpheas with moist eyes. He was wearing the same kind smile she had seen in her childhood.

"Won't you trust me just once? When Shirone's matter is settled, I'll handle everything transparently. Even if I'm given any punishment, I'll face my beloved students with dignity. I will never run away."

Hot tears flowed down Amira's cheeks.

"Will you really come back? The person I respect..."

"Of course. There will be no deception in punishing me. I promise you on my lifetime's honor."

Amira wiped her tears with the back of her hand. She absolutely couldn't cry in front of Alpheas. She wanted to show him how much more mature she had grown compared to her childhood.

"I understand. Since you've said this as your final word, the student council will also accept the Headmaster's opinion and review the agenda again. Please don't do anything that would tarnish your honor."

Alpheas smiled warmly. She had grown into a capable and intelligent student. The child who used to run to him lisping "Headmaster!" had grown up like this.

'Erina, perhaps my life wasn't entirely in vain.'

Once the student council president made her decision, the protesters immediately disbanded. The conservatives who had occupied the entrance also scattered, and the building's front became desolate in an instant.

Only Fermi remained, scratching his head awkwardly.

"Ah, things were going well but I messed up at the end."

Alpheas burst into hearty laughter.

"Ha ha! Things didn't go your way this time, Fermi."

"Can't help it. Honestly, I think it's cheating for the Headmaster to step in."

"You should graduate now, shouldn't you? You'll be twenty-two next year."

"Well, there's still no better way to make money than here."

"Is that so?"

He knew that Fermi was the key figure who had orchestrated this incident. But Alpheas was just proud of how much his student had grown.

"Besides, this place is still fun. Well then, I'll be going."

Without any particular farewell, Fermi saluted and walked away. He probably wouldn't even set foot in the student council after today. Peaceful places don't make money.

Iruki and Nade heading to the infirmary were silent. It was the first time they had seriously fought since five years ago, so awkwardness still remained. But as expected, Nade couldn't stand this atmosphere.

"Hey! How can you not say a single word? You don't need to deceive me too, right? You just wanted to look cool by yourself, didn't you?"

"That's ridiculous. What kind of strategy discussion could I have with someone doing the butterfly stroke in a sea of sorrow? Besides, if information leaked, they would take countermeasures too. Why can't your brain work properly?"

"Fine, I'm an idiot! You're the only smart one!"

Whether he got angry or cursed, once the conversation started flowing, the awkward feelings disappeared instantly. Iruki asked with a worried expression.

"By the way, how are you? No matter how angry you were, you shouldn't have shown your old personality."

Nade also seemed to regret it greatly as he held his head.

"Ah, I don't know. I didn't have time to think about anything else then. Anyway, we didn't fight, so it's fine."

"Well, I was so cool after all. You might have already erased it from your memory."

"That's ridiculous. So you calculated everything after all?"

"Hehe, so what? At least bow to me or something."

Their conversation ended when the infirmary door opened. Amy had come out to greet them. Iruki scratched his head awkwardly. Unlike Nade, it was still difficult for him to be comfortable with Amy.

"Well, this is how things turned out. Anyway, we protected Shirone..."

Just as he was trying to brush it off, tears flowed from Amy's eyes.

"Thank you. Thank you, Iruki..."

Iruki made a terrified expression.

"Tch, forget it."

Being weak to emotions, he fled into the infirmary. But there, another emotional bundle named Seriel was waiting with her arms spread wide.

Iruki used boxing weaving techniques to dodge Seriel's embrace and took refuge with Shirone.

'Ugh, this is why I hate women.'

Seriel and Amy, who met at the door, hugged each other and started jumping around. Even Nade joined in, spinning around the infirmary.

"Waaah! He's alive! Now Shirone is alive!"

At this bright atmosphere after so long, a smile also crept onto Iruki's lips. But his inner feelings weren't entirely good. They had only postponed death on paper - nothing about the situation had actually improved.

Shirone was still not moving, as if asleep. The promise to stay together even after graduation was vivid, but it didn't feel real that the person involved was lying there dead.

'Come back. I'll wait for you no matter how long it takes.'

* * *

Shirone regained consciousness. More precisely, he went mad again from his mad state. His mind was repeating sanity and madness like a coin spinning rapidly between N and S poles.

He seemed to have gone mad a thousand times. He tried desperately to hold onto his overturning mind, but the enormous stimulus rushing in penetrated Shirone's essence and changed his nature.

"You're a picked-up child. Your parents would have been fine with anyone other than you. Didn't they ever find it difficult raising you? They must have regretted it every time. They must have thought they shouldn't have picked you up. If they were your real parents, they wouldn't have had such thoughts."

"No! That can't be!"

"You're a bastard child. Anyone in this world could become an adopted child. They are not your parents."

Shirone's particles shook and the cry of his soul spread.

Ooooooooh!

"Your essence is a vile predator. A being who tramples everyone with superior ability. Your power inevitably calls for someone's failure. You are an unnecessary tumor in this world."

Ooooooooh!

Shirone went mad again. It felt like his mind was giving off a foul smell. If the fusion ended like this, what would he be reconstructed as? An evil spirit? A demon? A devil? It was impossible to know.

The speed of going mad accelerated further. When he reached the limit, two natures began to coexist simultaneously in Shirone's mind as it rotated between extremes.

It was a new world.

In the ultimate mental state that no drug could reach, Shirone finally found the only solution to maintain his sanity.

It was the origin point.

If the boundary of circulation is called the limit, then the origin point is the starting point of the limit. But it contained the possibility of encompassing the entire world.

Someone calls it the spot. Someone calls it the Spirit Zone. Someone calls it the ultimate principle. But magicians called it this:

Infinity.

Shirone's eyes snapped open. The Spirit Zone was sucked into his mind, and countless particles that had been scattering at ultra-light speed began to be restored into a mental body.

At the center of infinity, Shirone did not waver. The voice that had tormented him disappeared, and the strength of his mental body tightened as hard as diamond.

The realm of Diamond Vehicle that could be reached only after thousands of agonies.

It was Diamond Indestructible.

Shirone looked toward the exit with his brilliantly burning body. There was no more confusion. As he took a step, the warm and bright light from the exit permeated his body and became one with him.

A small, transparent glass bead floated before his eyes. Inside the bead, small enough to fit in his palm, was contained the temple where he had just stayed, and from there the woman was looking up at Shirone.

"So you're leaving after all, Shirone."

"I'm sorry. But I want to go back."

"You don't need to be sorry. Honestly, I thought you wouldn't succeed. You are qualified."

He hadn't expected the woman to let him go so readily, which made his departing steps feel heavier. Perhaps that's why. Even though he knew it was irrelevant now, Shirone couldn't help but ask.

"Were you perhaps lonely?"

The woman blinked with a puzzled expression, then soon smiled warmly.

"Shirone is a kind person. But gods don't feel loneliness. I'm just a little sad that you're leaving. Just a little."

"Thank you for reviving me. I really wanted to say this."

For a moment, the woman's expression became serious.

"Remember this. There won't be a second chance. Having reached the realm of Diamond Vehicle, you are no longer someone who can receive my invitation."

Shirone nodded as if making a resolution and walked toward the exit. As his mind began to be sucked into a different dimensional space-time, he felt warm light.

'Finally, I'm going back.'

In his fading consciousness, he heard the woman's voice.

-Please give my regards to the Headmaster.

Even in his hazy mental state, Shirone was puzzled. How did she know Headmaster Alpheas? But the thought didn't last long, and as his mental body melted away, it was sucked into Shirone's physical body.

* * *

The 10th day of Shirone's death.

"Mmm."

Amy woke up rubbing her sleepy eyes. As she leaned back in her chair, there was a crackling sound. From staying up night after night, her body could move but her brain still felt asleep.

Looking around, she saw that her other friends hadn't woken up yet. After drinking water and washing her face, she approached Shirone while drying her face with a towel.

"Shirone. Will you come back today..."

Amy made a choking sound and held her breath. The sound of her heartbeat reached her eardrums. A thrill ran up her spine, making her shoulders, neck, and face tremble.

Shirone's eyes were open.

"Huh? Huh?"

Amy called to Nade and Iruki, who were sleeping on blankets spread on the floor.

"Here... here, here..."

The words wouldn't come out. She needed to at least make a sound, but her throat felt completely blocked. Amy tried a last resort. Taking a deep breath, she squeezed her eyes shut and screamed.

"Kyaaaaaaaaaah!"

At the scream that seemed to shake the infirmary, Nade and Iruki jumped up.

"What! What!"

**Return to Daily Life (1)**

Alpheas calmed his trembling heart and extended his hand. Even he, a certified 4th-grade magician, couldn't help but be surprised when he saw Shirone with his eyes open.

Currently, Shirone was under a slow magic spell. He probably spent the whole night just lifting his eyelids. To know if he was truly alive, there was no choice but to remove the magic.

Placing his hand on Shirone's chest, Alpheas reversed time. But Shirone still showed no signs of movement. What would happen next, no one could predict. They could only follow heaven's will.

"Gasp!"

Then Shirone gasped and sat up. The faces of those watching anxiously brightened. In contrast, Shirone was terrified as if he had returned from hell.

"What? What happened?"

Shirone was startled by the sudden rush of air. The world seen from a slow state was an abstract painting full of colors. As the scenery returned to normal, he could see people's faces. Behind Alpheas were Amy and his friends, on the verge of tears.
