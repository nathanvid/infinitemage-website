From Shirone's perspective, not much time had passed. After entering the Immortal Function, he had met the woman and escaped through the black holeâ€”that was all. But in reality, ten whole days had already passed.

Shirone awkwardly smiled and raised his hand.

"Haha. Hello?"

"Hello, my ass, you little brat!"

"Ouch!"

Amy spun Shirone's face around with her fist. Though there was no real impact, Shirone fell back onto the bed from the force and looked back with a tearful expression.

"Ow! Why did you suddenly do that?"

Amy shed tears like chicken droppings.

"You bad guy, making us worry like that... You horrible person!"

Shirone looked dazed. Everything was rushed and bewildering. But soon he seemed to realize something and smiled warmly. Amy's tears told him everything about what had happened during his absence.

"I'm sorry. Because of me..."

"Shirone's back!"

Nade and Iruki pushed Amy forward and buried Shirone in the bed. Amy, who had unintentionally ended up in Shirone's embrace, shouted with a reddened face.

"Kyah! Hey, get away!"

"Argh! It hurts! I said it hurts!"

Shirone also screamed in pain. Actually, it was more from embarrassment than pain. Thinking that he wouldn't even be able to look at Amy later if this continued, he twisted his body with all his might, causing his friends to tumble to the floor.

"Phew, what the heck was that?"

Shirone, sitting on the bed, looked like a refugee who had been bombed. On the floor, Amy, who had fallen, was rubbing her sore back while scolding Nade and Iruki.

"What a grand welcome. Youth really is a wonderful thing."

Shirone looked at Alpheas and straightened his expression. Just the fact that he was here showed how serious the situation had been.

Shirone asked Nade what he was most curious about.

"What happened to Arcane? What about the other students? What on earth happened?"

Nade, who had been getting scolded by Amy, shouted with an incredulous expression.

"That's not the problem right now! You were dead for a whole ten days!"

"What? Ten days? And I was dead?"

"Of course, man! How can you be alive when your heart isn't beating? Explain what happened."

Shirone seemed shocked and couldn't speak for a while. He would have to tell them about what he had experienced, but he had no idea where to start.

The infirmary door opened and the teachers entered. Siena showed a surprised expression upon seeing Shirone awake. Of course, she had prayed desperately for him to come back to life, but actually seeing it with her own eyes was shocking.

Though she hadn't achieved enlightenment of infinity like Shirone, she had a vague understanding of how terrifying and painful it would be for a human to return from a state where their mind had been dismantled.

'Still, you came back well. Thank you.'

Siena smiled and glanced sideways at Ethella. She had been tormented by tremendous guilt for ten days. As expected, she approached Shirone with a face that looked like she was about to cry.

"Shirone."

"Teacher, I'm sorry. I did it again..."

Ethella pulled him into her chest without even listening to Shirone's words.

"I'm sorry. It's my fault. If I had been just a little more careful. This will never happen again."

To his friends, it looked like a beautiful embrace between teacher and student, but for Shirone who was on the receiving end, it was deadly. Ethella was hugging him so tightly that he couldn't breathe. Embarrassment aside, he really felt like he might suffocate.

"Um, Teacher..."

"Yes?"

"I'm sorry, but... please save me."

"Oh my!"

When Shirone made a muffled sound, Ethella hastily let go of him.

"Sorry. I was so happy that I unconsciously..."

Shirone took a deep breath with a face that had turned blue. But even this feeling belonged to this world. Happy to have returned, he smiled and said,

"Now I really feel like I've come back."

When his friends' eyes narrowed, Shirone, realizing his mistake, frantically waved his hands.

"No, it's not because of that kind of thing. I mean, this is..."

"You little brat, what are you saying?"

Amy ran over and grabbed Shirone's cheeks.

"What? Don't I give you that sense of reality? Huh?"

"No! That's not what I meant!"

Nade and Iruki burst into laughter. Alpheas watched Shirone mingling with his friends with a pleased expression, then quietly slipped out of the infirmary. He would be the busiest person from now on.

"Headmaster."

When he turned around, Shirone had somehow slipped out and was walking toward him after closing the infirmary door.

"What is it? I think it would be good for you to rest for a while. Listen to your friends about what happened. Anyway, the school will likely remain closed for the time being."

"Yes, thank you for your concern. But... there's something I'm curious about."

"Oh? Something you're curious about?"

Shirone told him everything he had experienced without leaving anything out. From the moment he entered the realm of infinity to how he returned to the original world through the black hole.

At first, Alpheas listened with interest. But as the story progressed, his face gradually hardened. Especially when Shirone explained the woman's abilities, he closed his eyes and sighed.

"Did that woman say she knew me?"

"Yes. She asked me to give you her regards. It's a hazy memory, but I think that's what I heard."

Shirone wondered if he had brought up something unnecessary. Alpheas's expression was much worse than he had expected.

"Yes, I think I know who it is."

"What? You know her?"

Shirone's eyes widened. Alpheas was certainly an outstanding magician, but the woman existed in a place that transcended life. It was strange that he had met both people who lived in different worlds.

But Alpheas thought differently. Not coincidence, but inevitability. Shirone meeting her had been predetermined from the moment he realized the Immortal Function.

"Who is that woman exactly?"

"Adrias Miro. She was called the Labyrinth of Space-Time back then. She's my student who specialized in Scale Magic."

Shirone looked dazed. He had never dreamed she would be Alpheas's student. He was especially shocked to learn that her abilities, which he had thought were divine powers, were actually magic.

"What is Scale Magic?"

Alpheas scratched his eyebrows while choosing his words for explanation.

"Shirone. In the magical society, those who have reached the Immortal Function are called Unlockers."

"Yes. I've heard of that."

"Then this will be easy to explain. Miro is also an Unlocker. She had tremendous curiosity from a young age. She kept digging endlessly. Into worlds larger than the universe, worlds smaller than particles. Scale Magic is magic that can only be used by those who have realized the infinity of space-time."

Shirone recalled when he had met Miro. Certainly her main ability, the glass orb, had freely expressed the relativity of space-time.

"Ms. Miro said she had been watching me all along. Is that possible?"

"You don't need to worry. Miro exists in a different dimension from you. But when you opened the Immortal Function, you might have momentarily reached the same dimension. Miro was probably waiting for that moment."

"But why me specifically? Unlockers are rare, but according to Arcane, they're not that few in number either. There must be many Unlockers superior to me."

Alpheas stroked his beard and paused. What he was about to say was top secret information that only teachers who had worked for more than 20 years knew.

"Miro is the founding president of the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society."

Shirone recalled Miro's face. It was surprising that she was the person who created the research society he currently belonged to, but if she was the founding president, she would be from nearly 20 years ago, yet she seemed to have barely aged.

"Miro wasn't obsessed with phenomena. She believed there were too many things that couldn't be explained with knowledge. She joined forces with her peers to establish the research society in Estas. Michea Gaold, who is currently the president of the Tormia Magic Association, was also one of the founding members."

Shirone tried to imagine the members of that time. According to Nade, the master key of Magic Warehouse Estas was created by someone with the same Servant ability as Iruki. It wouldn't be Miro, and it wouldn't be Gaold either. He could roughly guess how outstanding the founding members had been as prodigies.

While Shirone was lost in thought, Alpheas also recalled events from 18 years ago. Miro was a good child. If only that day's incident hadn't happened. Suddenly realizing there was a fact he had forgotten, he looked back at Shirone.

"Shirone, do you happen to know how many students there are in total?"

As if he hadn't asked to hear an answer, Alpheas immediately continued.

"Of course, the total number is always changing. Someone graduates, takes a leave of absence, or receives disciplinary action. But no matter how many students there are in total, this school is always short one person."

Alpheas turned his head toward the window as he spoke.

"Miro never graduated. She's still staying at this school."

Shirone gulped. It felt like hearing a ghost story passed down in every school. But what did it mean that she was staying? Didn't he say she lived in a different dimension?

At that moment, Scale Magic came to Shirone's mind.

"Then surely..."

Alpheas nodded and said,

"That's right. Miro is in Estas. Of course, it's a higher dimension created by Scale Magic. Those who know call that place the upper level."

Alpheas placed his hand on Shirone's shoulder.

"Shirone, promise me. Don't tell anyone about today's events. The upper level is not something you should know about. You must never, ever get involved with the upper level. It could throw the world into chaos."

Shirone couldn't readily answer. The unknown world. Unlockers. Scale Magic. All the information was shaking his heart. Of course, he had no intention of recklessly stepping into dangerous places. But saying he would absolutely never get involved would become a lie in some way or another.

Alpheas sighed as if he had expected this.

"If you really want to know about Miro, I'll allow you to investigate the Kergo Ruins. I'm not suggesting this to appease you. It's too dangerous to dive straight into the upper level. So please keep this promise at least."

Only then did Shirone nod. There must be a reason why Alpheas was stopping him this strictly. Also, he wanted to approach things step by step as well.

"I understand. But thinking that she's staying in Estas gives me the creeps. I don't think I'll be able to sleep in the research society. She might suddenly appear."

"Don't worry. Miro will never leave the space she created."

Shirone tilted his head. Being this confident meant there was a way to prove it.

"But she's such an outstanding person, is there a special reason?"

Alpheas looked out the window with a sad expression. It wasn't something he had said with particular confidence. But he knew that Miro would never return.

"To Miro, this world is... too painful a place."

* * *

Alpheas, Canis, and Arin left for the capital city Bashka to undergo investigation by the Magic Association. According to the teachers, the temporary school closure would continue until the association made its decision.

Shirone was hospitalized in the infirmary. Since his heart hadn't beaten for ten days, it was the medical staff's judgment to monitor his condition. Shirone also didn't want to do anything for the time being, so he was killing time gathered with his friends.

"Shirone, I'm sorry. You must have felt very hurt."

Seriel said with a tearful expression. The most regrettable thing for her after regaining her memory was how coldly she had pushed Shirone away on the day he brought coffee.

"No, it's okay. It was because of the magic. Senior Seriel did nothing wrong."

"Even so, how could I forget you?"

"It's really okay. Please don't keep it in your heart too much."

Seriel's eyes became as gentle as a deer's.

"Shirone is really kind. So what will you do now? Will you demand my body?"

"What?"
