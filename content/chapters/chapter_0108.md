Shirone's face turned bewildered. His friends' reactions weren't much different. Amy shook her head from side to side, then pressed her hand to her forehead and said:

"Seriel, what kind of books have you been reading lately?"

"Oh! This one right here!"

Seriel pulled out a novel as if she'd been waiting for this moment. The provocative red cover bore the title "Primal Snare."

"This is the hottest book in bookstores these days. It's about a married nobleman who falls in love with his maid, and there's this line in it: 'I broke your plate. What will you do now? Will you demand my body?' So then the nobleman ties her up with rope and..."

"Stop! That's enough!"

Amy raised her hand to cut her off. She had a feeling she shouldn't hear any more.

"Why? This is where it gets interesting."

"Seriel, no matter how much you love novels, please don't confuse them with reality. Those books use sensational and provocative content to captivate readers."

"Hmph! You just haven't read it. If you read it just once, you'd fall completely into this world. Since we're on the topic, should I lend this to you?"

When Seriel held out "Primal Snare," Amy hurriedly turned her head away. If she accepted her offer, she'd be subjected to at least a week's worth of reviews and commentary.

Shirone leaned back against the cushion and said:

"Sigh. Today's the last day in the infirmary. Thanks for visiting me all this time. You too, Senior Seriel."

"Don't say such sad things. Honestly, studying in the graduating class was killing me. It was good for both Amy and me to catch our breath."

Amy didn't disagree either. The stress from daily ranking competitions had reached its peak. The temporary school closure was like a blessing for the graduating class students.

Seriel spoke with a gloomy expression:

"But I'm worried about the principal. Honestly, this decision was unexpected. It's something that could have been handled by the Creas autonomous district, but he said he'd personally accept an inspection from the Magic Association."

Alpheas had voluntarily filed the complaint. With his high reputation across the continent, he could have easily covered up the situation, but he accepted all of the student council's demands. Eventually, the matter was transferred to the notorious Inspection Department 3 of the Magic Association.

"Inspection Department 3 is called the special investigation unit even within the Magic Association. They say they follow the law absolutely, regardless of connections. Even Principal Alpheas won't be able to avoid disciplinary action."

Shirone thought it was actually a good thing.

"The principal has lived with pain for 40 years. If this opportunity can lighten his burden even a little, I think accepting discipline is a good thing too."

Nade said:

"Let's just watch how things develop first. Who exactly are we worrying about? It's Alpheas, a certified 4th-class magician. When the school closure ends, we'll be busy again, so let's rest well while we can."

"Yeah. That sounds good."

Shirone looked toward the window.

The afternoon sun was streaming in with drowsy light.

The capital, Bashka.

The view of Bashka from the Underground Mountain Range showed the royal castle soaring as if to pierce the sky, with key institutions spreading in concentric circles around it. The capital's residents say that buildings visible from the Underground Mountain Range are truly the institutions that symbolize the nation.

One of them was the Magic Association. The 18-story building managed all affairs of every magician registered in the Kingdom of Tormia, and through coordination with other institutions, it served as the nation's central hub, handling surveillance and intelligence missions for the magical community.

Though it was a place any magician would want to visit at least once, Thad, who had been appointed as the escort responsible for Alpheas and Canis's party, felt like a cow being dragged to the slaughterhouse.

"Master, is this really the best course of action?"

"This is what I wanted. The only thing I regret is that I dragged it out too long."

Alpheas's resolve was firm. Thad hadn't asked with any particular expectations either. He simply wanted to reconfirm his master's will, since once they crossed the Association's threshold, there would be no turning back.

"I understand. Then I'll wait until the trial is over."

Alpheas looked pleased. Taking Canis and Arin with him, he surrendered himself to the Inspection Department, and the three were each confined to separate cells to wait for a day.

The next day, Alpheas was the first to enter the interrogation room. Meanwhile, Canis and Arin waited their turn in an isolation facility covered with magical devices. The magic control devices made it impossible to enter the Spirit Zone. But beyond that, even Harvest couldn't function.

After about three hours, a summons came down.

"Canis, Arin. Come out."

Though their charges hadn't been officially proven yet, the Magic Association officials were already treating the two as criminals. It was probably because they had heard Alpheas's report from his completed investigation.

Canis and Arin silently followed the instructions. As they entered the corridor with the interrogation room, they saw Alpheas walking from the opposite direction. Canis intended to pass by him indifferently. But just before they crossed paths, Alpheas turned to the guard and said:

"Sorry, but could you give us a moment to talk?"

"Ah, yes. But not too long."

Canis snorted at the guard's completely different attitude when dealing with him versus Alpheas. The reason Alpheas received respect wasn't because he was strong, but because he was famous. It annoyed him that someone whose magical ability was inferior to Arcane's was acting with the leisure of a victor.

When the guards stepped aside, Alpheas said:

"You don't need to be too nervous. Just answer a few questions and you'll be out."

"Aren't you mistaken? We're not the docile students you teach. We've fought countless battles. No matter what situation comes, nothing scares us."

Canis, who had experienced all kinds of hardships on the battlefield, certainly possessed something his peers lacked. But because he had lived such a life, he had also lost much. Alpheas wanted to help these two young people, whose futures were still bright, regain what they had lost.

"Actually, that's why I wanted to see you."

"What do you mean?"

"How about enrolling in magic school when this matter is resolved?"

Canis felt like he'd been hit with a bucket of curses. Didn't he know how he had lived? To ask someone who had learned magic while dancing between life and death to mix with hothouse flowers.

"Don't be ridiculous. Master didn't lose because he was weak. If it weren't for Abyss Nova, no, if we had fought properly, I could have taken you down in one shot."

"That might have been possible."

Alpheas readily acknowledged it.

"But if it hadn't been that method, I might have been the first to kneel and beg forgiveness."

Canis bit his lip. It was unacceptable, but he couldn't refute it either.

"Canis, that's what evil is. No matter what reasonable justification you present, you're bound to be hated. You can rise higher. I want to give you a bright future, not darkness."

"Why do you care about me? Are you pitying me?"

"I too was Arcane's disciple. That makes me your senior disciple. Just as time cannot be turned back, connections last forever. If you want to live a new life, I'll help you."

Canis didn't respond. What kind of new life could there be now? All he had learned was combat, and so his fate was to live only on the battlefield.

As Alpheas walked away down the corridor, the guard grabbed Canis and Arin again and dragged them to the interrogation room. Unlike the Inferno prison he had imagined, the interrogation room was neat and clean. A small man sat at the table with his back turned. From behind, nothing could be confirmed except that he had silver hair.

"Investigator, these are the suspects in this case, Canis and Arin."

"Ah, please come this way."

A chilling voice like scraping metal. Befitting someone who worked the field for the notorious Inspection Department 3, a blade-like aura could be felt. Canis and Arin walked around the table and sat facing the investigator. Contrary to expectations, he didn't have a frightening appearance. His chin was pointed like a cat's, and he was smiling with thin, slit-like eyes.

"I'm Investigator Sakiri from Inspection Department 3. You are Canis and Arin, correct?"

"That's right."

Canis answered calmly. But no answer came from Arin. Since it wouldn't be good to irritate the investigator, Canis turned his head and asked:

"Arin, what's wrong?"

Arin was trembling with a pale face. Canis understood the situation from seeing Arin's pupils shaking with shock as she looked at Sakiri.

'What did she see to be this surprised?'

"Canis, I can't read him..."

There was no way Arin, with her insight, couldn't read the feel of objects. Therefore, it meant there was originally no feeling, or the feeling had been artificially erased.

Indeed, Sakiri's appearance as Arin saw him was bizarre. His entire body was smooth metallic material like a mirror, and his egg-shaped face didn't even have facial features. His hands and feet were sharp like cones, making it impossible to read even the slightest emotion. It was a form of insight that could only emerge when emotions were perfectly blocked.

"Oh my, the young lady seems surprised. That's called insight, right? We've blocked magic, but there's no way to prevent inherent traits. Of course, I don't think you two would cause a disturbance."

Sakiri seemed interested as he put down his pen and crossed his legs.

Arin watched the cone-shaped legs cross. They twisted like pretzels repeatedly, then untwisted.

'This person is playing around.'

It wasn't simply suppressing emotions. This was someone who could perfectly control his emotions.

"Focus."

Arin jerked her head up in surprise. The investigator's mirror-smooth face stretched into a sharp cone shape, approaching right up to her forehead.

"Please do. We're on official duty, after all. You are Arin, correct?"

"Yes, that's right."

Frightened Arin didn't even know she had answered. The sharp cone aimed at her forehead was probably Sakiri's piercing gaze. It was the first time she had seen insight manifest in such a clean form. She thought that no matter what kind of criminal, if they were caught by this person, they wouldn't be able to pick their bones clean.

Canis and Arin finally faced reality. They were captured by the kingdom's most powerful and authoritative judicial institution. As the two waited dejectedly, Sakiri's face, which had been sharp as a needle, returned to a smooth metallic egg shape.

"Well, I've written up a report based on Mr. Alpheas's statement, but there are a few things to confirm. Please answer my questions."

Sakiri checked various matters through questions and answers. Arin and Canis answered honestly. After an hour passed, Sakiri organized his files with a satisfied expression and said:

"Yes. Most of the statements match. There are some discrepancies, but they're not particularly important."

It was too casual a statement to come from an Inspection Department investigator. But Sakiri leaned back in his chair as if it were no big deal and continued:

"In the end, it's a kind of brainwashing, isn't it? So it's like this. Arcane used your unfortunate lives to brainwash you from childhood."

"What?"

Canis's eyes filled with intensity. He would have preferred being called a villain. Sakiri's statement was no different from completely denying the roots of the life Canis had lived.

"Master never forced anything on us. I did it, I committed those acts."

Arin, who knew the investigator's strength, was anxious when Canis got angry. But the form of Sakiri as seen through her insight still showed no change.

"A vicious method indeed. He rescues you, makes you respect him, then says this: 'I need something like this, but of course, I'm not necessarily asking you to do it for me.'"

Canis couldn't understand what the investigator was saying. He had come here to pay for his crimes. But now, brainwashing? Was he planning to put him in a mental hospital?
