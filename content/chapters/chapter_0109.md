"So what do you want me to do about it? What changes if I admit I was brainwashed?"

"Well... you'd both receive not guilty verdicts."

Canis's expression went blank. He had followed Arcane to help criminals escape from Inferno. He was also the person who had endangered the lives of hundreds of students at the magic school. Even if he wasn't the main ringleader, a not guilty verdict was absolutely impossible.

"Not guilty... us?"

"Oh, of course that's only if you admit to being brainwashed. Anyway, the Association is currently focusing on the possibility of brainwashing."

If he admitted it, he'd be released. He'd be a free man. Not only himself, but Arin too could live a new life as if nothing had happened.

For once, even Canis felt his blood run cold. Most strange of all was the Association's judgment. When they should be struggling just to catch criminals, why were they making such a fuss about releasing them?

"Oh, and one more thing."

Sakiri rummaged through the file folder as if the thought had just occurred to her. Maybe it really had. Either way, Arin couldn't read the investigator's emotions.

"Arcane's personal lawyer sent an official document. They requested anonymity, but the notarization is complete. Take a look at this for now. It's his asset details, will, and inheritance-related documents."

"A will?"

Sakiri pushed the documents across the table as if no explanation was needed.

Canis checked them one by one with trembling hands. Arcane's will was nothing special. It was written in calm handwriting, simply listing matters to be handled after death.

Among them was this phrase:

\[Document] All assets to be transferred to Canis

'Master...'

He didn't think Arcane had been a warm person, or that he had secretly looked after his disciple. Rather, because he had been someone who boldly pushed forward with his convictions, there would have been no lies in how he treated him.

Arcane had proven that fact with his will. Though he was someone who didn't care about his disciple's life, he had still considered Canis his only student.

After setting down the will, Canis checked the asset details.

Real estate including various dungeons, physical assets like magical equipment, expensive artifacts, rare herbs, and the amount deposited in banks were all clearly organized.

'1, 10, 100, thousand, ten thousand...'

Canis counted the total assets written at the end.

'4.8 billion gold...'

It was a sum worthy of the wealth that Great Magician Arcane had accumulated over 150 years. Because of that, Canis couldn't understand the current situation. First they suddenly said he was not guilty, and now they were telling him he'd become the heir to an inheritance of 4.8 billion gold.

Sakiri scratched her head with a troubled expression.

"But you see, there's actually a slight problem. Arcane leaving his inheritance to you was surely his way of acknowledging you as his disciple. But the Magic Association, well, that's what brainwashing is, isn't it? Implanting a false self. Ultimately, we think Canis was deceived by Arcane. Otherwise, there's no way you would have committed such atrocious acts, right? That's why the Association is somehow considering acquittal. But if that happens..."

"I can't receive the inheritance? Because I'm not Arcane's disciple?"

For the first time, Sakiri showed a gentle expression. Of course, her insight didn't change by even a hair's breadth.

"Yes. That's exactly the issue. The target of Arcane's inheritance was the brainwashed Canis, not the non-brainwashed Canis. Ultimately, this money would be transferred as illegal funds and revert to the Association, but before that happens, we wanted to hear your thoughts. If you admit to being brainwashed, you'll receive a not guilty verdict. And you just need to sign here."

Sakiri pushed forward an additional document. Canis looked at it with empty eyes.

Inheritance waiver statement.

If he admitted to being brainwashed, he'd be found not guilty. Because he was merely a victim used by Arcane. But if that happened, the assets Arcane had left him would end up entirely in other people's hands.

Ultimately, the Association had chosen the substance of 4.8 billion gold rather than catching two youngsters.

"I could give you time, but it might work against you at trial. It would create suspicion about the voluntariness of the crime. I mean, does it make sense? Of course you were brainwashed. Otherwise, would Canis and Arin have committed such heinous crimes?"

His mind went blank. He'd thought he wasn't afraid of dying in battle. But the investigator said he was not guilty. It seemed like he'd definitely done bad things, but they said he hadn't.

'This place is no different from Radum.'

The outside world wasn't a greenhouse with sunlight either. It was just a battlefield where massive desires swirled, wrapped in the guise of law.

When Canis hesitated to answer, Sakiri clicked her tongue and stood up.

"Then I'll give you some time. About an hour..."

"I'll sign."

Sakiri, who had half-straightened her knees, stopped mid-motion. Then she smiled again and sat back down.

"You made a good decision. Now, here..."

Sakiri personally handed over the fountain pen she used. Canis wrote his name in the signature section of the waiver statement.

The pen scraped across the paper. Sakiri received the pen back with a pleased smile and checked the statement.

"Congratulations on becoming a free man. Now that it's over, I'll say this - you made the right choice. If you'd hired a lawyer, things would have gotten more complicated."

A lawyer. He hadn't even thought of it. Maybe he should have hired one?

No, Sakiri hadn't lied.

If the Magic Association had been an easy place, they wouldn't have presented a waiver statement from the start.

"What should we do now?"

"Well, I guess you can just leave. You're free now."

Canis and Arin had been completely cleaned out, so to speak. But Sakiri acted as if it was none of her concern, just gathering her documents and turning away.

"Where do we handle release procedures..."

"There's nothing like that. You can just go."

From her attitude, like chasing away an annoying door-to-door salesman, Canis could understand the inside story.

From the beginning, the Magic Association hadn't even bothered to look at people like them. They had only endured the inconvenience and allocated about two hours to recover Arcane's assets.

More miserable than the wounded pride was the Association's power that he could do nothing about even knowing the truth. He could feel firsthand just how incredible Arcane had been to openly wage war against the continent's nations.

Canis regained his composure. Now it was clear. He was a battle mage. And since he knew how to fight, there was nothing more to hesitate about.

"Hey, you."

Sakiri turned her head at the door.

"Did you call me?"

"You're a mage too, right?"

"Hmm, you could say that. All Magic Association employees are mages."

"What rank?"

"Certified 5th rank."

Canis could imagine the enemy's level. The Magic Association's investigator was a certified 5th rank, and she was this kind of person.

"I won't end here. I absolutely won't collapse like this."

"I see. That's good. Well then, I'll be going."

"Someday... I'll definitely make you my subordinate."

Sakiri's hand stopped as she turned the door handle. After thinking for a moment, she looked back at Canis with a thin smile.

"Well then, I'll have to study hard. Actually, the competition for this position is quite fierce. But if such a situation ever comes..."

Sakiri put her right hand to her chest.

"I'll be in your care then."

Even at the investigator's unusual attitude, Canis showed no reaction. He only realized how thoroughly practical Sakiri was. Bowing once didn't cost money. Nobody knew the future anyway.

After Sakiri left, Arin smiled as she looked at Canis. They'd been found not guilty anyway, so there was nothing bad about it. Wasn't it better than rotting in prison for life while holding 4.8 billion gold?

"Canis, you made the right choice."

"There are... many strong people in the world."

The corners of Canis's mouth rose faintly. Now that he had a new goal, his heart was beating as intensely as when he first met Arcane.

"Arin, let's get stronger."

"Yeah..."

Arin looked at the door Sakiri had exited through. Canis would come back here someday. Since this wasn't their end, she too could move toward the future.

After leaving the interrogation room, Sakiri headed straight to the inspector's office. Considering the severity of the situation, the matter had been resolved quite easily. Arcane's death was significant. There was no legal conflict, and Alpheas acknowledging guilt was also a major factor.

The inspector's office was a luxurious room with a marble floor. The man called the Iron Inspector, a legend of Inspection Department 3, stood with his hands behind his back looking out the window.

"Inspector, here are the approval documents for this case."

"Put them on the desk."

Sakiri placed the file folder on the desk. Normally she would leave immediately, but this time she couldn't suppress her curiosity and turned back at the door.

"Is the Alpheas matter okay as is?"

"Why? Do you think there will be talk from above?"

"Six months suspension is on the light side. But I don't think there will be talk. It was 40 years ago, there was no intent to harm, and if you convert 4.8 billion gold as compensation, it seems like an appropriate settlement."

"Then why are you asking?"

The counter-question meant it was as expected. Feeling like she'd unnecessarily stirred up trouble, Sakiri smacked her lips. But since it had come up, backing down would also be a bad move.

"I wondered if it included a sense of atonement."

The inspector was silent for a long while. Then he slowly turned to look at Sakiri.

"I did do something unfortunate to Alpheas. But I've never once determined a criminal's punishment based on personal feelings."

"I'm sorry. I misspoke."

"Now go."

Sakiri hurriedly left the inspector's office in embarrassment. Though he was an investigator with a bad reputation among criminals, within the Association he was just another mage watching his superior's mood.

The inspector opened the file folder. After carefully reviewing the sentences, he took out his fountain pen and brought it to the approval section. Countless memories flashed through his mind. Though he had now become a white-haired old man, when he recalled that time, his jaw still felt like it was throbbing from being hit at Alpheas's house.

"Tch. I should have brought a gift."

Though he had never visited Alpheas once since his mistake with Erina, he had lived his life never accepting the fact that he had lost.

But during the 40 years that passed, photon theory had continued to evolve and innovate, changing the world even at this very moment.

Now even he had to acknowledge how genius an achievement Alpheas had accomplished back then.

"Hehe. A belated gift. The Gold Circle was rightfully yours."

The inspector inscribed his signature on the document.

Ardiano Sarov.

End-of-Term Report Cards (1)

The end of the semester had arrived - the most nerve-wracking time for magic school students. Half a year's worth of achievements would be condensed into a single sheet of paper. The cutline that determined advancement or failure was as terrifying as a guillotine.

Alpheas had received a six-month teacher qualification suspension from the Magic Association. The legal effect would take place from next semester, and currently Collie, the most senior among the teachers, was temporarily acting as principal.

Alpheas, who had been weeding the flower bed, straightened his back and smiled. His cute students were walking toward him from a distance. Shirone, Iruki, Nade. They were troublemakers that everyone at school now knew, but that made their future all the more promising.

"Hello, Principal."

"Hehe. I told you not to call me principal. Right now I'm just an old man doing odd jobs."

"Come on. You'll be principal again in just six months."

Alpheas just smiled. While grateful to his students who still supported him, he felt unworthy and couldn't hold his head up high.
