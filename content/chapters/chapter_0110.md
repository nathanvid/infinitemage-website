"Right. How about you guys? You must be dying now that the break is over, right?"

Nade's face quickly turned into a grimace.

"I'm going crazy. I have to get over 80 points in all subjects for the remaining period, and it's killing me."

"Haha! How about trying to advance this time?"

The only way to move up from Class Five to Class Four was to score 80 points or higher in all subjects. The difficulty was at the highest level, considering it wasn't an average of 80 points but 80 points in every single subject.

"Of course. Isn't that what any student would naturally think about?"

"Well, I suppose so. Go ahead and give it your best shot."

Nade looked deflated, having expected some words of encouragement. But Alpheas's educational philosophy was firm. Students weren't racehorses. If you let them loose in a meadow, they would naturally come to realize their own worth.

"Should we help you out a bit?"

Shirone rolled up his sleeves and approached to help with pulling weeds.

"Hehe, I can't let you take away an old man's only pleasure. I'll pull the weeds myself, so you boys do whatever you want."

Disappointment filled Nade's eyes. His plan to escape reality even a little by using weed-pulling as an excuse had fallen through.

"Yes. Then please take care."

Worry filled the faces of Shirone's group as they turned toward the dormitory. This was the same for the other students as well. Ever since Arcane's attack, the school was still in disarray, and it wasn't easy to concentrate on studies like before.

In his frustration, Nade exploded.

"Agh, I'm going crazy. I need to study. Study! Study! I just can't concentrate at all."

"When something big happens once, other things naturally don't come together easily. It was the same after the presentation ended."

At Iruki's words, Shirone let out a deep sigh.

"Still, you're better off than me. I have twice as many subjects to raise above 80 points compared to you guys. I don't know if it's even possible."

"The only subject I have an advantage in is math. I'm hopeless in humanities. In that sense, Nade has the best chance."

"What are you talking about? I don't have any particularly strong subjects. You and Shirone can definitely aim for the top in practical exams, but I can't even do that, so I'm at the biggest disadvantage."

The practical exams for Class Five focused mainly on Spirit Zone operation rather than magic itself. With Shirone's Immortal Function and Iruki's savant syndrome, they could rank high in any practical exam. On the other hand, Nade had to compete with the same Spirit Zone as other students.

"Thinking about all this is giving me a headache. Should we just rest until today and start tomorrow?"

At Nade's suggestion, neither of the two agreed nor disagreed. Seeing that even the exemplary Shirone was keeping his mouth shut, it seemed his motivation had been broken too.

"Huh? Hey guys, over there..."

When Shirone pointed toward the central park, Nade and Iruki turned their heads and their eyes widened.

"What? How are they here?"

Canis and Arin were walking around the campus. When they made eye contact with Shirone's group, they walked toward them. Canis raised his hand in greeting.

"Hey. Classes over already? The facilities and environment are decent, but you seem to treat the kids too softly."

"You! What exactly are you plotting?"

Nade blocked their path. Of course, he had heard from Thad that the two had been released as innocent, but he thought their connection ended there. No, it had to end there. So why were they strolling around the school?

Shirone asked.

"What's going on? Do you have some business at the school?"

Without answering, Canis looked Shirone over. If there was anyone at the school he was most concerned about, it wasn't Alpheas or the teachers, but Shirone. The first person to inflict defeat upon him. If he couldn't surpass him, no matter how strong he became, he would just be marking time.

"Listen carefully. If I face you again, the result will be the complete opposite of last time."

Before Shirone could answer, Nade shot back first.

"This bastard still hasn't come to his senses. You'd need 10 years before you could beat Shirone."

"You'd probably need more than 10 years before you could face me."

Nade's expression crumpled. The emotions from when Shirone was hovering between life and death revived, and murderous intent flashed through his mind. Then Iruki, not wanting to cause unnecessary commotion, summarized the situation.

"Stop it. Never mind the rest, why did you come here?"

"Why? This is going to be where we'll be living, so we're taking a look around."

"What?"

At the unexpected words, Shirone's group's eyes went round.

"Just as I said. This magic school or whatever, I thought it might be good to experience it."

Nade rolled up both sleeves and snapped at them.

"There's a limit to how much you can look down on magic school! Who would accept someone like you?"

Canis pointed with his finger.

"Senior."

"What?"

"Call me senior. I looked into it, and you guys are Class Five. I'm Class Four."

Shirone's group was dumbfounded. It must have been Alpheas who accepted the two. But Class Four right upon enrollment? While not entirely impossible, it was certainly a rare case.

"Why are you so surprised? We're disciples of a Great Magician. We've learned all the basics of magic. It would be ridiculous to treat us the same as leisurely guys like you."

Shirone's group felt their blood boil but kept their mouths shut. Having mastered magic while spending over 10 years with Arcane, it was true that even Class Four might not be satisfying enough for them.

"So I hope you'll politely call me senior from now on."

"Ridiculous! You're only going to attend from next semester anyway, right? By then we'll have advanced to Class Four too!"

"Really? Your grades are surprisingly terrible, you know? Honestly, I was disappointed. To think I struggled against such dimwits."

The first thing Canis investigated at the school was Shirone's group's grades and peer relationships. When he learned they were in Class Five, and middle-tier at that, contrary to his expectation that they would be competing for the lead, it was shocking.

But none of the advanced class students looked down on them. He had heard until his ears were callused that if they put their minds to it, they could climb up anytime.

When Shirone's group couldn't retort and ground their teeth, Canis turned around with a satisfied face.

"Anyway, work hard. If you come in as juniors, I'll be fond of you. Hahaha!"

As Canis's shadow stretched toward Shirone while he walked away, Harvest raised both arms and put up his middle fingers with both hands. The shoulders of the three infuriated boys trembled.

Shirone broke the heavy silence.

"Playing today is canceled."

"Right. Canis being a senior? I'd rather quit school than see that sight even if it kills me."

"Hmph, why quit? We need to advance proudly and crush his arrogance."

The three boys had only thoughts of advancement in their heads. But how? End-of-term evaluation was on a different level from breaking through obstacles. It was the culmination of a long six months, so even if they started something right now, success couldn't be guaranteed.

"I've thought about this before..."

Shirone began with a serious expression.

"The probability of me being able to advance at my level was about 30 percent. That's if I studied my absolute best."

Though it wasn't mathematical analysis like Iruki's, Shirone's insight was also highly reliable, so his friends thought his words were likely true. Then Nade's expression darkened again.

"Honestly, even though I talked big, thinking about it, it's not easy. If Shirone is about 30 percent, I'm maybe 50 percent? Iruki is about 60 percent."

"No. I'm about 58.7 percent. Of course, advancement is evaluated mainly based on end-of-term grades, but honestly, I haven't attended a single class."

All three let out sighs. At this rate, they would have no choice but to bow their heads to Canis and Arin starting next semester.

"So, how about this..."

At Shirone's suggestion, Nade's eyes lit up as he turned around.

"What is it? Do you have a good idea?"

"Honestly, if we study the way we've been doing so far, the success probability is too low. So we need to modify our strategy."

Iruki said.

"You mean change our method? But how?"

"The 30 percent I mentioned assumes studying hard. But if we target just the exams instead of studying, I think it could be over 50 percent. That means for you guys, it could be 70 or even 80 percent."

"Hmm. Target the exams? I think I know what you mean. You're talking about selective focus, right?"

"Exactly. We only need to get over 80 points anyway. There's no need to invest time in subjects we're good at. We don't need to study material that won't be on the exams either. If we broadly categorize the sixteen subjects, we can divide them into four fields: humanities, mathematics, science, and practical."

Shirone continued his explanation, counting on his fingers one by one.

"The fortunate thing is that we can easily pass at least one field each. And most importantly, our fields don't overlap. I have humanities, Iruki has mathematics, Nade has science. Practical is a part where we can't help each other anyway."

Iruki nodded as if he understood.

"So you're saying we should form a study group. Since we don't need to study our strong fields, we use that time to complement each other's weaknesses, right?"

"Right. If we focus on passing on the essential techniques to get over 80 points on exams, the probability will be much higher. With this, I think we can raise it to 50 percent."

Iruki's lips curved up. Seeing Shirone being this desperate, it seemed having Canis and Arin as seniors really bothered him.

Anyway, it was a decent idea. Also, if all three of them could advance simultaneously, there couldn't be a better result.

"I'm in favor. Then let's go to the research club right now and make a plan. How about it?"

"Great!"

The three boys, burning with fighting spirit, ran to Estas.

* * *

Shirone devoted himself to studying day and night.

You have to know how to handle time. To someone who isn't conscious of it, an hour passes in an instant, but to someone who breaks an hour into 10-minute segments, it's quite a long time.

Shirone broke down all the remaining time until the end-of-term exams into 1-hour units. It was a strategy to prevent time leakage by always keeping track of time in his head.

With the powerful efficiency gained from this, he would snipe the exams.

Rather than understanding processes, he conquered problem types and analyzed the intent behind questions and solution methods. In this regard, the study group was effective. Thanks to complementing each other's lacking areas, Shirone was also able to raise his average mock exam score above 70 points.

Of course, it wasn't all smooth sailing. When he actually tried studying, he realized that the reason certain subjects were weak wasn't due to laziness but because he genuinely lacked aptitude.

Iruki especially had too big a gap between humanities and mathematics. As he frantically worked through a test paper that Shirone had personally prepared, he put down his pen and stretched after just 30 minutes.

"I'm done."

"Let me see."

Shirone went through the problems Iruki had solved one by one. The more he checked the answers, the more his hands trembled. He could understand why humanities teachers turned pale just looking at Iruki's face.

With a dumbfounded expression, Shirone pointed to the test paper and said.

"Hey, how does 'You eat pasta, I'll eat pasta' make sense? I explained the usage of auxiliary particles to you."

"Why doesn't it make sense? You eat pasta! I'll eat pasta! It fits perfectly, right? It's a sentence that emphasizes each person as an independent subject."

"Huh? Ah, that..."

Shirone was momentarily flustered, feeling it sounded plausible. But he quickly regained his senses and shouted.

"That's not it. Language isn't mathematics. It's not a tool for proof but a tool for expression! So instead of separating sentences, you need to read the meaning between the lines!"

"Damn, what's that about? Mathematics is the best!"

"Shut up! I know you're being stubborn! Honestly, you feel it's strange too, don't you?"
