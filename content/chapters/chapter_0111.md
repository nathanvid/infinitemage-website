"Of course it's strange. But that's just a matter of perception. Mathematically, it's a perfectly fine sentence."

Iruki's pride in mathematics was truly tremendous. How detestable must it have been for the humanities teachers to give his exam papers a zero?

Shirone decided to use his final measure.

"Aren't you going to advance to the next grade?"

"Urgh! Damn it!"

Even Iruki had no choice but to surrender to those words. He'd rather die than enter as Canis's junior.

As Iruki threw himself back into problem-solving, Shirone returned to his seat and let out a sigh.

'If he really acts like this during the actual exam, that would be truly terrible.'

Nade suddenly looked up from his book as if something had occurred to him and asked.

"Ah, come to think of it, there's a practical exam next week. Have you guys practiced much?"

Shirone and Iruki asked simultaneously.

"What exam?"

"Geez, damn it. You didn't even know what it was? It's the mental pulse test. Spirit Zone endurance evaluation."

"Do we really need to practice? Both Shirone and I can easily get over 80 points. Why, are you worried?"

"No. But practicals have a lot of variables. Unlike other subjects, this one's graded on a curve. If others do better, our scores drop. I thought we should at least go over it once."

"It's fine, it's fine. We don't have time anyway."

Iruki didn't even listen and devoted himself entirely to problem-solving. How much could Class Five level students handle with Spirit Zone anyway? Iruki thought the practical exam would be an automatic pass.

Shirone said while solving math problems.

"I'm going to skip it too. I absolutely don't have the energy to worry about that."

Nade had his own confidence as well. But it was also true that it would be difficult to score higher than the two in front of him.

'Hmm. What should I do?'

If it really seemed difficult, he could ask for help. But taking away his friends' time just because he was anxious would be taking advantage of their rules.

'Whatever. I just need to stay in the top 10 anyway.'

Nade gave up thinking and started studying. If each person couldn't achieve their 33.3 percent share, the study group's efficiency would be destroyed.

They cooperated with all their might for the benefit of the whole, but in the end, results weren't something others could pick for you.

Image Zone practice hall.

Originally this would be the time for advanced class integrated lessons, but currently only Class Five students had gathered.

It was the notorious practical evaluation period that had cornered Shirone multiple times. With the end of the semester approaching, the students' tension was higher than ever.

Ethella entered the Image Zone and, as always, spread out a Spirit Zone with a 20-meter diameter and began her explanation.

"Today's evaluation item is the mental pulse test. You could say it's a test that measures how long you can sustain changes in your Spirit Zone."

Ethella stretched both hands left and right, pointing to distant places. Black poles made of an indeterminate material rose high, with unknown characters carved on their surfaces.

"The evaluation standard is 20 meters in diameter - the distance between the ends of the poles. If your Spirit Zone is smaller than that, you cannot take the exam. Of course, there shouldn't be any participants among you who can't exceed 20 meters."

Ethella contracted her Spirit Zone. When the number on the electronic board measuring the zone's volume dropped below 2 cubic meters, a buzzer sounded from the audio device.

"When the buzzer sounds, that's one cycle. The measurement time is 30 seconds, and scores are given according to the number of Spirit Zone pulses. Since we haven't had many occasions to practice with the recorder on, I'll demonstrate first."

When Ethella gave a signal, the Image Zone's mental pulse mode activated. Simultaneously, Ethella's Spirit Zone began repeatedly expanding and contracting, pulsing like a heart.

"Wow..."

The sight of a 20-meter diameter Spirit Zone dropping below 2 meters in diameter and then instantly expanding again was spectacular. The cycle wasn't particularly fast, but the form of repeated contraction and expansion was as intense as an explosion.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The sound machine, one of the Image Zone's functions, calculated the expansion speed and produced explosion sounds.

The sounds weren't simply implemented to create excitement. Grasping the formless Image Zone with all five senses provided the highest efficiency for magical training.

After 30 seconds, the number 30 appeared on the notification board. She had pulsed once per second.

According to what the seniors said, you needed to score at least 90 points to make the advancement cutoff. Three pulses per second. The children used Ethella's demonstration as a reference to make final checks on the strategies they had prepared so far.

After finishing her demonstration, Ethella clasped her hands behind her back and said.

"In real combat, you often need to rapidly transform various forms of zones at high speed. Mental pulse is the fundamental training for that, so it's important to keep working at it steadily even after the practical exam ends. Now then, let's proceed with the evaluation."

Based on the scores from the Speed Gun exam they had taken before, students began coming out starting from the back rows. As expected, since it was difficult to improve skills in just a month or two, most rankings were similar to last time.

Students recorded their scores one by one, and with the lowest score being 48 points, Nade's turn came around. Since he had placed in the upper-middle tier on the Speed Gun exam, he had to take the test much earlier than Shirone and Iruki.

"Nade, do well."

"Phew, I'm nervous."

Receiving encouragement from Shirone and Iruki, Nade entered the Image Zone, closed his eyes, and concentrated his mind. With the starting signal, he opened his eyes and expanded his Spirit Zone. Like the heart of someone running at full power, the zone pulsed at high speed.

"Wow! What's this, Nade?"

The children's eyes went wide. Only 10 seconds had passed and he was already breaking through 50 points. Five pulses per second came across as tremendous force even to those watching.

"Wasn't he originally middle-tier? At this rate, he'll definitely enter the upper ranks, right?"

"He's been hanging out with Shirone and his skills have improved tremendously, hasn't he? If I'd known this would happen, we should have joined the research society too."

"Right. Those kids have been studying frighteningly hard lately, haven't they? Even Iruki, who used to slack off every day, hasn't skipped class once."

Thirty seconds passed, and Nade's score came out. 173 times. Accelerating in the last 10 seconds had helped improve his score.

"Good work, Nade."

Ethella smiled warmly as she recorded the score. She felt even better since the student she was directly responsible for had made remarkable progress.

'Well, I expected about this much from the beginning.'

Nade stuck out his tongue sheepishly as he returned. After high-fiving his friends, he sat down and said.

"Phew, I was so nervous I thought I'd die."

"You did well. At least one of us has passed. Only we two are left."

Perhaps stimulated by Nade, the subsequent participants also took the exam with all their might. However, no score higher than 173 points emerged in the end.

With Nade maintaining first place, Iruki, who was second to last, entered the Image Zone. Standing without any sign of nervousness, Iruki activated his Servant ability as soon as it started.

The method of pre-designing the mechanism of expansion and contraction and repeating it like a machine wouldn't be very useful in actual combat, but it produced the highest efficiency for exams.

The score he achieved was 210 points.

The children looked at the score with bewildered expressions. It was a number that couldn't come out without mechanically hitting exactly 7 pulses per second without any variation in speed.

"Hah, amazing as always. Is even his mind an equation? That bastard probably didn't even do this properly."

"Can't help it. He's a Servant. This time even Shirone might have trouble winning?"

Then a voice from the back poured cold water on the heated atmosphere.

"Hmph, making such a fuss over such a trivial score. Is Class Five a gathering place for pathetic fools?"

The moment the indignant students turned around, each of them opened their eyes wide as if they had seen a ghost. Canis and Arin, who were supposed to enroll starting next semester, were watching the practical evaluation.

Ethella, who had been recording the students' scores, asked.

"Hm? You two there, what's going on?"

"The principal said it was okay to observe. We came to see how the exam is conducted."

"Ah, I see. Then come this way. You can see well from here."

Canis's brow furrowed. Was that woman really someone who had fought his master on equal terms? During the battle there was no time to notice, but watching the class, she seemed to have a foolishly gentle personality.

'Is she doing it on purpose? Or is she really an idiot?'

Anyway, it was true that he was interested in the exam. Canis stood behind the participants with Arin.

"How is it, Arin? In your opinion?"

"I've done heart pulse training to the point of exhaustion. Master made me improve it no matter what. I could easily surpass 250 points."

Arin was a mentalist magician. Especially since she had to freely handle tentacle forms, which had the highest difficulty among zone shapes, her Spirit Zone endurance was second to none.

'As expected of Arcane's disciples. They're on a different level from us.'

The students who heard Arin's words naturally felt intimidated. They too were children of noble families, but if you aimed to be a magician, everyone dreamed of being a Great Magician's direct disciple. Even if their origins were slums, when it came to magic alone, these two had walked an elite course among elites.

'Hmph. But we have a secret weapon too.'

As Shirone, the last participant, entered the Image Zone, the students cheered for him with one voice.

They knew that Shirone had subdued Canis when he regained his memories. So they hoped he would show them what he was made of this time too.

Shirone took a deep breath in the center of the Image Zone. Since Iruki had scored 210 points, there would be no problem advancing as long as he got somewhere in that range.

But Shirone's eyes had changed from before. Now that he had a firm goal, he had no intention of taking the exam half-heartedly, whether it was against Canis or not.

As the device lit up at Ethella's signal, Shirone pulsed his Spirit Zone at maximum intensity from the start.

Without precise design like Iruki's, dividing one second equally was difficult. But humans had rhythm sense, a very accurate biological clock.

Shirone placed the zone's pulse count on rhythm and accelerated it. A rapid-fire burst that might be heard in a drum line erupted from the sound machine.

Papapapapapapapabang!

The children couldn't close their gaping mouths. They watched Shirone's demonstration without even blinking, but they could only properly confirm the Spirit Zone about once per second.

"How is that possible... How many times per second is that?"

Since multiple layers of Spirit Zone were moving simultaneously, it was impossible to count with the eyes. The students waited for 10 seconds to pass. Shortly after, the tremendous number 120 points appeared on the electronic board.

"Twelve times per second..."

Could you imagine a sphere with a 20-meter diameter contracting 12 times in one second? They were just watching with their eyes, but no one knew what was happening inside that zone. Only the explosions bursting in volleys and the numbers counting at tremendous speed proved that Shirone's mind was pulsing.

Even Canis and Arin watched the demonstration in a daze. Especially Arin had an expression of disbelief. When pulses become that fast, the mind collapses first, regardless of speed.

How quickly could you extend from the smallest circle to the largest circle, and how much could you endure the shock when contracting - these were the core of pulsing.

In that sense, the demonstration Shirone was showing was the highest realm that maximized both speed and durability.

'Diamond-like Indestructibility.'

Ethella grasped Shirone's level at a glance.

'Truly amazing. That child's potential is completely immeasurable.'

Even Ethella could no longer be certain where Shirone currently stood. When she thought he was at one point, he had already moved far away to another.
