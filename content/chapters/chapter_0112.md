'My originally strong mental endurance has risen exponentially. Now I can control even Immortal Function to some degree.'

Shirone's specialty was the defensive form of the Four-Direction Style. Like most defensive types, the teachers had expected Shirone to become a defensively-oriented mage as well.

But Immortal Function had turned that inclination upside down. Now his strength in endurance had become an essential element supporting his offensive power.

As 20 seconds passed, Shirone gritted his teeth and attempted one final acceleration. With a terrifying speed, the sound exploded as his score broke through 340 points.

Beep—!

The measurement time ended and the buzzer sounded. Shirone closed his eyes briefly and took a deep breath. Dozens of children had gathered, but silence filled the hall. Everyone was staring intently at the scoreboard.

410 points.

On average, his heart had beaten 13.6 times per second to endure those 30 seconds. Moreover, the final 5 seconds had been rapid-fire strikes exceeding 15 beats per second.

"That's really incredible. Why are those guys acting like this lately? At this rate, won't they really become upperclassmen next semester?"

"Even so, advancement would be difficult. His theoretical grades are in the middle group. Raising scores in such a short time isn't easy."

Shirone turned to look at Canis. It was a silent declaration asking if he could still become an upperclassman despite this.

"That child is truly remarkable."

Arin admired him with pure heart. Infinite mental power through Immortal Function and the endurance to control it. On top of that, the unique magical inclination to give mass to light.

There was no explanation other than that he was a mage specially loved by the gods.

"Hmph, this is the level required to be called a worthy rival."

Canis's fighting spirit also blazed like never before. At first, he had thought it was a difference in attributes. But the demonstration Shirone had shown shattered such delusions completely. Now he would lose even in a contest of pure strength.

After glaring at Shirone for quite a while, Canis turned his body roughly.

"Let's go, Arin. The tour seems to be over."

The students felt relieved as they watched Canis and Arin's retreating figures. While Shirone didn't represent the level of all Class Five students, they all felt the same satisfaction of having crushed a Great Magician's disciple.

"Shirone, that was really awesome. I failed the exam, but I feel good. So what if she's a Great Magician's disciple? How dare she look down on Alpheas Magic School's Class Five?"

"Same with Shirone, and Iruki and Nade too. Are you guys really planning to advance this time?"

"Well, we're doing our best."

Shirone avoided giving a direct answer. But Nade, who had placed third, was elated about having passed the practical exam.

"Hahaha! Of course! Better prepare to treat me properly as an upperclassman! Come on, come on! Let's practice from now. Try calling me 'upperclassman'!"

The students' protests poured out.

"Your arrogance is piercing the sky! Fall flat on your face!"

"If you become an upperclassman, I'd rather not attend school!"

"What if you fail the theory exam? How embarrassing would that be after talking so big? I'll pray every night that you absolutely can't advance!"

Regardless, Nade straightened his back proudly and burst into laughter. Being friends with all the students, he could endure such jeering.

Shirone and Iruki quietly slipped away from the scene.

'Ugh, how embarrassing.'

The final practical exam was over.

* * *

Summer was leaving.

Cool winds blew morning and evening, and the plants were preparing to change into colorful autumn clothes. But it was still hot during the day, and the children were devoted to burning through the last of the semester.

Only one final week remained. Classes had ended the previous week, leaving only final exams.

The exams were taken sequentially by class each day, starting with Class Ten. And finally, on the sixth day, Class Five students walked to the examination hall, trying to calm their pounding hearts.

Shirone's group also picked at their breakfast and arrived early at the testing site.

The exam lasted exactly 12 hours with only 5-minute breaks. Compared to ordinary schools, it could be called a schedule approaching hard labor, but for magic school students, maintaining concentration was as important as knowledge itself.

The exam questions were classified as types A, B, and C—the problems were the same, but the arrangement of answers differed. This was to prevent cheating and minimize cases of getting answers right by luck.

Shirone had type A, Iruki type B, and Nade type C. Assigned to different examination halls, they came out to the corridor before the exam started to relieve their tension. Since this exam would determine half a year's worth of results, even these notorious troublemakers couldn't help but stiffen up.

Despite the warm weather, Nade was shivering continuously.

"Ugh. I'm dying. Shirone, how are you?"

"I feel like throwing up. Just one mistake and it's over. Especially in mathematics."

"Let's stay calm. Anyway, we have enough time. We can get nervous after we receive the test papers."

At Iruki's words, the two tried to calm their minds. But when the bell signaling the start of the exam rang, anyone's complexion would inevitably turn pale.

"Well, let's go in. See you later with smiling faces."

"Right. Fighting!"

The three promised to meet again in 12 hours and entered their respective examination halls.

Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society.

Shirone's group was frantically busy grading their scores. While test papers couldn't be leaked, Iruki had perfectly reconstructed the exam questions.

A Servant's memory knows no forgetting. It was like putting bundles of documents in mental drawers and being able to take them out and read them whenever needed.

Iruki would call out problems, Nade would write them down, and Shirone would find the correct answers. Only after working until dawn could they reconstruct all the test papers for every subject.

Though their bodies were already exhausted, the three scattered and began entering their answers.

Since the test paper Iruki had reconstructed was type B, Shirone's correct answers had to be matched one-to-one.

"Phew, I'm nervous. I think I messed up several subjects."

Nade groaned. But everyone had weak subjects.

"Me too. Now that I'm actually doing this, it's really cruel. Even if you get perfect scores in other subjects, failing just one means it's over."

Shirone was more anxious than ever. Even with his insight, he couldn't guarantee advancement.

"Anyway, that's what the study group was for. Come on, come on! Let's evaluate later and finish grading first."

Several more hours passed, and gradually the outline of their grades began to emerge.

Nade was the first to stand up, raising his fist.

"Yes! I did it! Average 82 points! I broke 80 points in all subjects!"

Though there were no particularly high scores, he had evenly raised all subjects to achieve an 82-point average. He had been a troublemaker who used to look down on Class Four, but now that advancement was actually happening, he couldn't be happier.

Iruki and Shirone said nothing in particular. The time to truly celebrate would be when all three had confirmed advancement.

Iruki, who had finished grading, leaned back in his chair and wiped his sweat.

"Whew. I made it. 87 points. I got one 80-pointer in languages. If I'd gotten even one more problem wrong, it would have been over."

"Wow! So you passed too? Congratulations! Class Four!"

"This much is nothing. Anyway, I don't feel bad about it."

Nade and Iruki turned to look at Shirone without hesitation. If just one more person passed, their first aspiration of advancing together would be realized.

But Shirone showed no reaction. Iruki noticed that his hands had stopped moving while grading.

"Shirone, what's wrong? Did you fail the exam?"

Looking closely, Shirone's face was pale as a sheet. Something had definitely gone wrong.

Nade asked with an anxious expression.

"What's the matter? What's your score?"

"86 points..."

"Wow, you did incredibly well!"

Nade was genuinely amazed. Though they had set the goal of everyone advancing, hearing it actually made him think it was nothing short of a miracle. Shirone was a commoner's son who had lived a life far from studying. Yet with just half a year of effort, he had achieved an 86-point average.

Compared to Iruki, who had gotten an 87-point average by using his Servant ability to get perfect scores in mathematics, one could see how desperately Shirone had studied.

Iruki, thinking the same thing, tilted his head.

"Isn't that... good? Do you have a subject you failed?"

"Well, I'm not sure about that."

"Not sure? What do you mean? Tell us exactly."

Shirone anxiously bit his nails. No matter how much he thought about it, he couldn't remember.

"Iruki."

"Yeah?"

"What was the answer to the last multiple-choice question in mathematical proofs?"

"Oh, that? The one connecting two mathematical formulas for proof? That answer was really long."

Iruki, who had spoken that far, looked startled and said.

"Don't tell me you..."

"Yeah, I can't remember. Which proof I thought was the correct answer. I tried solving it again, but it's the same. Back then I was definitely torn between two choices."

"What's your score? If you get that wrong, what would it be?"

"78 points..."

Iruki and Nade realized the seriousness of the situation. The last multiple-choice question was worth 2 points. Therefore, one question's result would determine advancement or retention.

"How can you not remember that? What number did you mark as your answer?"

"Number 3. But since I had type A, I can't verify it."

Nade hurriedly pulled out the test paper. An extremely difficult proof formula spanning twenty lines for just one choice was densely written. Honestly speaking, he had gotten this problem wrong too. Probably only Iruki in Class Five could have solved it easily.

Shirone clutched his head in agony.

"I was thinking it was either number 2 or 3. With 10 seconds left I was agonizing over it, when suddenly it came to me. But... I can't remember what it was."

This happens once or twice when time is tight. Nade and Iruki, who had been at the magic school since childhood, knew well how that felt.

But this time, advancement was at stake. If he failed here, he would have to remain in Class Five for another half year.

Nade was dying of impatience.

"Damn! I absolutely can't wait any longer!"

"What are you going to do?"

"Go check directly. Let's ask Teacher Siena. She's our homeroom teacher."

Shirone also felt like nothing would settle in his mind at this rate. Having made their decision, the three left the research society and headed to the examination hall.

Since it had taken a full day to grade, Class Four's exam was currently in progress. Taking advantage of lunch break, Shirone's group entered the building and anxiously waited for the teachers to return. After about 30 minutes, Siena walked down the corridor. The three rushed toward her as if racing.

"Teacher! Teacher!"

"Huh? Why are you here? Class Five's exam ended yesterday."

"The last multiple-choice question in mathematical proofs type A! What's the correct answer?"

Siena tilted her head. Though her major was chemistry, since test papers underwent at least three reviews, all teachers participated in grading. Of course, even if it wasn't her specialty, with her skills, student-level mathematics was trivial.

"Why suddenly ask that?"

"Quickly! This is really an important question."

Reading the urgency in Nade's eyes, Siena recalled the last multiple-choice question. It was quite difficult, so it remained in her memory.

"Oh, that? For type A, it's number 2."

"Number 2..."

Like being struck by a hammer, Shirone's body stiffened. The answer he had written was number 3. In the end, he had gotten it wrong. With a score of 78 points, advancement would fail by just 2 points. At this thought, his breath caught.

"Number 2... Number 2..."

Muttering the same words, Shirone suddenly grabbed the back of his neck. Then, unable to bear it any longer, he fell backward. Just before collapsing in the corridor, Nade hurriedly supported him.

"Shirone! Are you okay? Pull yourself together! Aren't you Diamond-like Indestructible?"

"Number 2? Why... how could it be number 2..."

"Teacher, we'll be going! Thank you for your hard work!"

Even while being dragged away, Shirone kept muttering the same thing. Siena, who had been watching quietly and blinking, chuckled and headed to the faculty office.

"Those kids never get tired, do they? They're full of energy every day."

The faculty office was bustling with teachers grading papers. Siena also sat down and began grading. Then she suddenly opened a drawer and pulled out the type A mathematical proofs test paper.

"The last multiple-choice question, right?"

Siena examined the last problem. After briefly solving it mentally, she smiled brightly and said.

"Ah, it's number 3."

Arian Shirone. Advancement confirmed.
