Kaizen Swordsmanship School.

Located in the capital of the Kingdom of Tormia, Kaizen Swordsmanship School boasted a proud 200-year history and had produced numerous knights who achieved great feats.

There were more than ten certified 1st-grade swordsmen alone, and among them, three had even been granted the title of Sword Master.

Iron conviction. Symbol of courage.

Anyone in the Kingdom of Tormia who dreamed of becoming a knight wanted to enroll in Kaizen Swordsmanship School.

However, this place had no entrance exam. Instead, they underwent a month-long probationary process during which the cadets' aptitude was evaluated before final admission was decided.

The number of cadets flocking in each semester was a whopping 300. Of these, only 30 could gain admission.

Rian, who proudly belonged to these 30, was currently taking classes at Kaizen Swordsmanship School.

Urban combat training ground.

The training ground, which perfectly recreated the scenery of a cityscape, was Kaizen's pride.

An instructor with gaunt cheekbones protruding like a skull sat on the stairs, glaring at the first-year students as he spoke.

"Today's practical subject is movement. Among these, you first-years will be evaluated with focus on center displacement."

The instructor's name was Farka Kuan.

A certified 6th-grade swordsman who, before injuring his leg in war, had been called the Death Magician—a master of the sword.

"Center displacement is an ability every swordsman must possess. This is where the three beats of the sword—speed, power, and accuracy—begin."

Kuan limped on his right leg as he walked down the stairs. Then he pointed to a boy with a robust build and asked.

"You. Where is a swordsman's center of gravity?"

"Sir! The navel!"

"Wrong. You, answer."

Kuan pointed to a cadet with shark-like slitted eyes. Even if they didn't know the answer, they had to stand up immediately. If they hesitated even slightly, they'd receive punishment regardless of any test.

"Sir! The soles of the feet!"

"Wrong. You."

"Th-the sword!"

"Drop and give me pushups. 200 repetitions."

"Sir!"

The cadet broke from formation and began pushups. Exhausting stamina before a test was terrible, but the swordsmanship school instructors couldn't care less about such things.

Kuan drew the longsword at his waist. The tip was spread like a fan, and the blade appeared relatively slender.

"Where is a swordsman's center of gravity? The answer is outside. In Schema terminology, this is called external gravity. Repeat after me, external gravity."

"External gravity!"

Even while shouting, the cadets were furious. To explain a term they'd never heard in an entire semester right before the test!

"The reason I haven't explained it until now is because it's bothersome. Of course, idiots like you wouldn't understand anyway. But since I'm in a bad mood today, I've decided to add external gravity to the evaluation as well. Got it?"

"Sir!"

The cadets' response echoed loudly. Their vigorous shouts contained murderous intent. If they changed the evaluation criteria now, what would become of their efforts rolling around like dogs for half a year?

*Ah, I really want to do something to him. What kind of instructor is that?*

"I'll demonstrate only once. Watch carefully so you can apply it to the evaluation."

Regardless of their individual thoughts, silence fell over the already quiet colosseum.

"Strike while advancing, strike while retreating."

Kuan demonstrated slashing while repeating advance and retreat movements. Though it looked ungainly due to his limping leg, the sound of cutting through air was terrifying.

"This is the movement of ordinary swordsmanship. Physical strength displaces the center, and center displacement draws out the sword's destructive power. Moreover, if you enhance muscle strength with Schema, the sword's destructive power can increase exponentially."

The cadets gulped. It was a story they'd heard until their ears were worn out, but their tension before the test was at its peak.

"...is probably the kind of low-level thinking you're doing. But if you approach real combat with such ideas, you'll die within three seconds."

*How annoying.*

The cadets' eyes became even more intense.

"Remember this. No matter how strong your destructive power, if you're outmatched in movement, the outcome is predetermined. Therefore, swordsmen use their center of gravity for movement according to the situation. For example, like this."

Kuan stamped the ground with his sole. Then, lifting one leg, his body fell toward the floor.

The cadets gaped blankly. Kuan's central axis was tilted more than 70 degrees.

Was this really possible? Unless he had a rope tied around his waist, it was impossible for a human to maintain such a posture.

"Force amplified by Schema maximizes center displacement. Currently, my center is outside my body. This is called external gravity."

Kuan's body sprang upright like a roly-poly toy.

"Using external gravity makes movement possibilities infinite. For instance, this is also possible."

Kuan again struck the ground with his sole while falling backward. His body, tilted until his back nearly touched the ground, rotated drawing a cone.

"External gravity isn't actually existing gravity. It's merely extremely strong inertia. Therefore, if you add rotation to external gravity, the body also rotates."

When Kuan extended his sword outward, the rotation slowed. But as the angle gradually returned, centripetal force caused acceleration.

Swish swish swish swish swish swish!

Kuan, standing vertically, spun at tremendous speed. Then, as if time had stopped, he ended the rotation in a precise posture.

The cadets looked at Kuan with eyes of shock. What would have happened if they had been standing in that spot? Their ankles would have been severed first. Then they would have been hacked to pieces by the accelerating blade, cut into dozens of fragments.

Defense was impossible. It was the same principle as humans being unable to stop a tornado caused by atmospheric pressure differences.

Such explosive external gravity. To make an analogy, it was a technique similar to a mechanical device with blades rotating.

*This is the Death Magician.*

It was a nickname given because he dealt death before opponents even knew how they were hit.

"This is today's practical evaluation. Obstacle course is first, urban combat movement is second."

"Instructor, I have a question."

"Drop and give me pushups. 200 repetitions."

The cadet broke from formation. And while doing pushups, he thought: What exactly did I do wrong?

"Remember this well. To get the answer you want, you must overwhelm the other party. The instructor is not your parent. Don't look at me with eyes desperate for praise. It's disgusting. Got it?"

"Sir! We'll correct ourselves!"

"Try again."

The cadet who finished punishment raised his hand while gritting his teeth.

"Instructor! I have a question!"

"Speak."

"What does urban combat movement evaluate!"

"I'll explain that now."

The cadet felt embarrassed. Actually, his motivation for asking the question was to look good to Kuan. But Kuan considered even respect a manifestation of weakness.

"Urban combat movement. This is bothersome, so I'll keep it short."

Kuan entered the building. The front was open like a dollhouse, so there was no problem hearing the explanation.

"The place where external gravity shines is complex terrain. Especially in urban combat, space is also confined, so victory or defeat can be determined by the level of movement."

Kuan stomped the wooden floor with his foot. But he didn't attempt external gravity.

"The reason for striking the ground is to generate force and shift the center. This is called first impact. Of course, there's no time for such crazy behavior in real combat, but for beginners like you, it would be good to definitely strike the ground."

Though mixed with disparagement and mockery, students who were impressed by Kuan's prowess no longer felt angry.

"However, I don't strike the ground for first impact. If I struck here with my strength, the floor would be smashed. In Schema, the external gravity series employs various first impacts, and among these, I'll use the basic muscle vibration."

Kuan contracted his upper body muscles to generate vibration. In that state, he jumped up and placed his hand on the wall. By bending his elbow to control inertia, he created a spectacle of floating in mid-air for more than three seconds.

"Wooooah."

The cadets let out exclamations of admiration. Naturally, "Drop down!" should have followed, but Kuan continued the explanation, perhaps finding it bothersome.

"Create external gravity with first impact while jumping. Of course, in this case, external gravity would act in the direction of the wall. Applying this, this kind of movement is also possible."

Kuan walked along the wall surface. The cadets, slowly raising their heads, looked upward vertically with expressions of disbelief. Kuan was standing upside down on the ceiling with both feet.

"External gravity ultimately uses the force of inertia to offset gravity. Therefore, gravity is currently not acting on my body."

The sight of Kuan walking on the ceiling was beyond wonder—it was almost eerie. But this wasn't magic.

Even circus acrobats without Schema could run up walls to some degree. Kuan simply maximized inertia with stronger and more precise force.

When external gravity dissipated, Kuan's body fell following gravity. When he finished the demonstration and came out of the building, the cadets' expressions had completely changed.

"Everyone drop. 200 pushups."

"Sir!"

The cadets dropped down with "oh no" expressions. Since regular students could mostly handle Schema, it wasn't an impossible number. However, since the enhancement range first-years could employ wasn't very large, 200 repetitions was quite a stiff punishment.

"Listen while you do them. The first practical is horizontal obstacles, and the height decreases as the stages progress. The final stage cannot be passed without using external gravity. Time limit is 20 seconds. The obstacles are made with real swords, so in serious cases, it could lead to death. Of course, I trust there won't be any idiots who avoid the obstacles. If injured, you'll receive treatment from Instructor Kaina."

Kaina was the swordsmanship school's best surgeon. While mages had healers, swordsmen had surgeons who performed operations. The problem was that the pain of surgery was extreme. Especially for amputation patients, since they connected even the nervous system, patients often fainted during treatment.

*Damn! Hearing that makes it even scarier!*

"Urban combat movement is simple. Create external gravity and lean on the wall. The longer you last, the higher your score. Got it?"

"Sir!"

After examining the cadets' expressions filled with fierce determination, Kuan gathered his evaluation sheets and moved to position.

"Starting with number 1. I won't call names, so come out when it's your turn. Those waiting, rest."

Rian sat down and propped his chin. Since each person took at least 3 minutes, time could be considered ample.

"How about it, think you can do well?"

It was a woman's voice, rarely heard at the swordsmanship school. But Rian turned his gaze as if it were nothing special. She was a beautiful woman with golden hair flowing like waves. Tall with a slender figure, her long arms and legs gave a refreshing impression.

Elzain Tess.

The only daughter of the prestigious Elzain family in the kingdom, she was a woman who had enrolled in swordsmanship school to inherit her father's work as a colonial commander.

Her face could look cute if viewed cutely and fierce if viewed fiercely, but her personality was fierce no matter how you looked at it. With outstanding skills unmatched among first-years, she was a natural warrior who didn't shrink back even among countless men.

"Sit down quickly. If the instructor catches you, it's a death sentence."

"Oh ho, even the great Rian is afraid of the instructor? He's busy grading anyway, isn't he?"

"What do I know? That guy has eyes in the back of his head. Anyway, why did you suddenly move seats?"

"What's friendship for? I came to help you relax in case you were nervous."

"When have you ever seen me nervous?"

"Heh heh. Well, there's no floor left to fall to, so what would there be to be nervous about? Such a comfortable last place."

Though it was something that might offend any swordsmanship school cadet, Rian only pouted slightly. Tess smiled. His personality of not getting angry over most things was definitely what distinguished him from other kids.

Why was such a guy consistently in last place?

Among the first-years, the person who trained hardest was definitely Rian. No, he was completing a training regimen so harsh it could almost be called abuse, day after day.
