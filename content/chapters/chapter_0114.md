Even so, his grades didn't improve.

He'd heard that Rian had mastered Schema a month ago, but his strengthening progress was so slow that it was questionable whether it was even true.

"No matter how much I'm dead last, you never know until you try. When I actually take on the challenge, who knows? Things might work out better than expected."

"Hehe, yes, that sounds just like you."

Thad had never seen Rian nervous. With a test ahead that could result in severed limbs, it was strange that Rian—the weakest among them—remained so calm.

'Come to think of it, he was like that back then too.'

Thad had met Rian during their probationary period.

Swordsmen are naturally drawn to combat. With 300 such children gathered together, the atmosphere was vicious from day one. The instructors didn't particularly interfere with barracks affairs either. As expected, several wolves bared their fangs.

The hierarchy was established in an instant.

Those who had mastered Schema formed Group 1, those with strong physical abilities formed Group 2, and those who were neither formed Group 3. The problem was the cadets who couldn't even make it into Group 3—boys who had no interest in swords but were pushed into the academy by their parents' pressure.

Richard Pagar, the leader of Group 1, relentlessly bullied such boys. Already brutal by nature, entering a military academy that legally taught killing techniques had completely unleashed him.

Thad paid it no mind. In terms of skill, she belonged to Group 1, and the dozen or so female cadets were free from the hierarchy competition.

At that time, Rian's rank was in the middle of Group 2.

While this position shouldn't have subjected him to bullying, Rian didn't get along with anyone. His reason for applying to the sword school was singular: graduation didn't matter. Somehow, he had to build his skills to become a swordsman worthy of Shirone.

"Puahahaha! Hey, run! Faster!"

"Hee-hee-neigh! Hee-hee-neigh!"

One day in the barracks, Group 1 cadets climbed onto the backs of weaker children for a race. Every time they enthusiastically beat the buttocks of the boys playing horses with clubs, horse-like neighing sounds erupted.

Some cadets frowned at the sight, but most were engrossed in cheering as if watching an actual horse race. Though small amounts, real money was bet on the race. Moreover, showing the slightest distaste might result in finding oneself crawling beneath them.

"Faster! I'm winning! I'm winning!"

Pagar, leading the race, was ecstatic. True to his nature of never accepting defeat in anything, he gave his all even in this playful race. As the finish line came into view, his clubbing intensified. The cadet serving as his racehorse had to crawl with tears streaming and knees bleeding.

"Hee-hee-neigh! Hee-neigh!"

"Yes! I'm first...!"

Just as he was about to cross the finish line, Pagar saw a faint afterimage in his vision. Then a strong impact struck his nose.

"Argh!"

Kicked without warning, Pagar tumbled from his racehorse's back. Meanwhile, the trailing competitors successively crossed the finish line.

"Cut it out. Do you think this is your playground?"

Pagar clutched his throbbing nose and glared at the blue-haired boy.

"You bastard...!"

Ozent Rian.

As far as Pagar knew, he had mediocre skills even within Group 2. Realizing he'd been struck down by someone who hadn't even mastered Schema wounded his pride.

"What's with you? Do you want to die?"

Rian gave no reply. His nature of sparing words hadn't changed even after entering sword school. If he had nothing to say, he wouldn't fabricate any words.

"Look at this bastard..."

Pagar rose with murderous intent. The situation was explosive, but the terrified cadets couldn't bring themselves to intervene.

Of course, some felt no need to intervene. Thad was one such person.

This was a sword school. In a group learning war techniques, standing up for the weak wouldn't change anything. Ultimately, situations would be resolved according to the hierarchy of power.

"Oh, it's Rian? He finally caused trouble."

Thad turned around. Behind her stood another female cadet—a girl who was a head taller than the boys, positioned like a wall.

"You even know his name? He doesn't look particularly strong."

"He's weak. But stubborn. Last time, the Group 2 kids gathered money together. For Pagar's birthday. But the only one who didn't contribute was Rian."

"Ah, so that's why he's been targeted?"

"He'd been holding a grudge. But honestly, I was surprised. I thought he had a quiet personality, but he's unexpectedly hot-tempered."

"Hmm..."

Only then did Thad examine Rian closely. He still kept his mouth shut, but he didn't seem to have any intention of backing down either.

'There are kids like that too. The kingdom is certainly vast.'

Her interest ended there. Having grown up watching countless eccentrics due to her father's influence as a territorial commander, she'd seen it all.

No matter how much one proclaimed their beliefs, if their sword wasn't strong, it would break—that was the iron rule of this world.

"Kekeke. Has this bastard gone mute? It's too late for regrets. You didn't expect to keep all your limbs intact after pulling this stunt, did you?"

"Let's go outside. It won't look good in our evaluations if the instructors find out."

Pagar was incredulous. The very person who should be begging for his life was instead suggesting they fight away from the instructors' eyes.

"Fine, I'll give you what you want. Follow me. Everyone else follow too. I'll show you clearly what happens when you challenge me."

Pagar led Rian to an open area behind the building. Groups 1 through 3 positioned themselves behind Pagar, while only the ungrouped children stood on Rian's side.

But they had already lost their fighting spirit. No, they hadn't come with any intention to fight from the beginning. They simply hadn't been accepted into Pagar's group. In their hearts, they resented Rian for escalating things this far.

"Hey, anyone who doesn't want a beating, come over to this side."

Pagar offered an amnesty. The cadets didn't even hesitate. They rushed past Rian to the opposite side in a crowd.

"Puahahaha! Pathetic bunch. Hey, Rian. What will you do now? They've all run away and only you remain."

"Relying on numbers. You were yellow from the start."

"What did you say?"

"If there's no choice but to fight, then fight—that's what a knight does. Someone like you doesn't even qualify to become a knight."

Pagar snorted. When war breaks out, knights tear at each other like rabid dogs anyway. Chivalry was nothing more than wrapping paper used by survivors to elevate themselves.

"Fine, let's see if your fists are as strong as your mouth. I'll face you directly. You better not feel relieved. Saying you'll do it alone means I'm going to kill you."

Rian raised his fists and took a fighting stance. Meanwhile, Pagar approached leisurely as if taking a stroll.

"I'll let you hit me once. Go ahead, try it first."

When Pagar beckoned with his finger, Rian threw a punch. At that moment, Pagar dodged the attack and struck Rian's abdomen.

"Ugh!"

Rian's eyes widened at the pain that felt like his stomach was being torn apart. It felt like a heavy rock had been driven into his abdomen. So this was a fist strengthened by Schema?

"Idiot. Why would I let you hit me?"

Though Pagar mocked Rian, it was unexpected that he couldn't finish it with one blow. He'd been too careless. Thinking this, he now put his full effort into unleashing a series of strikes.

Rian was in a desperate situation. Though it was bare-handed combat, Schema itself was a lethal weapon. It felt like being pummeled by a heavily armored soldier.

When Pagar's fist drove into his abdomen, Rian's feet lifted off the ground.

When he landed again, even Rian with his good endurance couldn't remain standing. Rian's body, bent at the knees, plummeted headfirst toward the ground.

'That's more like it...'

Pagar sneered at Rian. At that moment, Rian shot out like an arrow and dove into his embrace.

'What? He's still holding on?'

Pagar was flustered. Rian hadn't mastered Schema. Moreover, he could tell from the feel of his punches that they'd connected properly. Without Schema defense, he should have lost consciousness by now.

Rian concentrated his attacks on Pagar's stomach. Aiming for the face would be easily dodged. But by covering his opponent's vision with his broad back and attacking from below, even Pagar couldn't rashly counterattack.

The strategy was effective, and Pagar retreated repeatedly. Each time a punch landed, his abdomen throbbed.

'What's with this bastard?'

From Pagar's perspective, even winning would be breaking even. The very fact of engaging in close combat with someone who couldn't even handle Schema was shameful.

"This damn bastard!"

Pagar lost his grip on reason. He grabbed Rian's shoulders, pushed him away, then frantically swung his fists. Dull impact sounds echoed through the clearing. The cadets watched the one-sided beating with pale faces.

When Pagar came to his senses, Rian lay crumpled like a rag. But he still hadn't lost consciousness. When Rian's fingers twitched, fire blazed in Pagar's eyes.

"Argh! So annoying!"

Pagar's kicks bombarded Rian. Finally realizing the severity of the situation, the Group 1 children rushed over.

"Hey, stop it! He'll really die at this rate!"

"Let go! I'm going to kill him! Die, you bastard!"

Rian's reactions gradually dulled, then finally his movement stopped. Pagar looked around. Seeing the terror on the cadets' faces seemed to cool his anger somewhat.

"Listen carefully! This is what happens when you challenge me! Hey, bring some rope!"

Rian was stripped naked except for his undergarments. His muscular body was covered with bruises. Thinking he needed to make an example, Pagar tied up Rian with rope and hung him from a tall tree.

Blood dripped from Rian's face as he hung curled up like a shrimp.

"Puahahaha! He looks exactly like a worm on a fishing hook! That's what you get for acting up when you don't know your place!"

"Kekeke. Ah, that must be really embarrassing. Acting all high and mighty, and now look what happened."

Mocking words poured out from everywhere. They acted as if they'd won a war.

Thad frowned. No matter how much the weak might be fools, to humiliate a person like this...

Moreover, there were girls of the same age present. What was Rian thinking right now? No, how wounded was his heart?

"Uh..."

Rian regained consciousness. He hadn't lost consciousness completely, but he wasn't in good condition either. Countless cadets were giggling. Their attitude was like people watching monkeys at a zoo.

Thad's eyes met Rian's. She tried to maintain an indifferent expression. In his current state, even sympathy would be wounding. But contrary to her expectations, Rian smiled and winked.

"Ah, sorry about this. There are ladies present, after all."

Thad maintained her indifferent expression, but strange chemical reactions were occurring in her heart.

"Puahaha! What are you saying now? Even in this situation, you're still putting on airs. You're just an idiot!"

"Hey hey! Be honest. After getting beaten to death, do you think acting tough makes you look cool? You're completely ridiculous right now."

"Embarrassed? Embarrassed? Looking like that in front of girls. I'd rather bite my tongue and die."

Rian looked down at the cadets. Despite the countless taunts, his eyes remained calm.

"It's okay. Even if it's embarrassing."

"Puahahaha! Well yeah, people like you have to live like that your whole life. Wait, are you maybe a pervert? You're secretly enjoying this right now, aren't you?"

Rian spoke calmly.

"I'll be able to forget this soon enough."

Silence fell. An inexplicable anxious energy dominated the quiet.

"I fought with everything I had, so I'm not ashamed. As time passes, I might not even remember a day like today existed. But... will you really be able to forget?"

No answer came. All their hearts were beating rapidly.

"The sight of you tucking your tails between your legs without even trying to fight will probably follow you for life. And you'll regret it. If only I'd fought then, if only I'd stood up then. But you know, don't you? That time cannot be turned back."

The cadets' faces trembled. It was a different kind of fear from Pagar's violence.
