"Defeat is fine no matter how many times it happens. Shame endured to protect your beliefs can be quickly forgotten. But the memory of running away in fear will follow you for life. When you eat, when you sleep, even on the battlefield—you'll be tormented by it. That's why a swordsman's conviction is worth more than life itself. Once it's broken, it never comes back."

No one mocked Rian anymore.

"No one wants to carry memories of cowardice. Especially not a swordsman. There will come a day when recalling today will feel worse than death. So end it here. If you want to stand proud in the future, then right now, in this moment, in this place..."

Rian coughed up blood as he shouted.

"Fight! You idiots!"

Rian's cry pierced through the cadets' hearts. Their blood began to boil. Though their skills varied, their desire to be called ghosts of the battlefield, the strongest swordsmen, knights of steel—that desire was identical.

The fighting spirit of hundreds rising simultaneously could be felt in the air. The atmosphere grew heated. The eyes looking at Figer no longer held the same fear as before.

Figer and his Group 1 allies felt the crisis and each began emanating killing intent.

"Shut up! No one listens to the words of a loser! Want to defeat me? Then come at me. I'll make you end up just like that bastard hanging there!"

Tess smiled as she touched her lips.

"Hmm."

Ozent Rian.

Sword school admission candidate.

"Not bad."

Tess kicked off the ground and launched her body forward. Leaping over Figer, she untied the rope, and Rian fell with a thud, curling his injured body into a cross-legged position.

"You said your name was Rian? I'm Tess. Let's fight together."

Tess offered a handshake, but Rian just stared at her. He couldn't move at all, still bound by rope.

Tess's appearance caused a stir among the children. Though she belonged to the female group, her skills displayed during training were evaluated as equal to Figer's.

"I'll fight too! I can't stand this anymore!"

"If even a girl is stepping forward, we men can't just stand around!"

One by one, they began taking Rian's side. Eventually, all the cadets except Group 1 gathered together and shouted.

"Let's show them what's what! Let's drive these bastards out of the school!"

"Drive them out! Drive them out!"

Figer's group found themselves surrounded by nearly 300 children. No matter how much they enhanced their strength with Schema, they couldn't handle these numbers.

"These bastards! Do you really want to die!"

"If you can kill us, then try it, asshole!"

A strong boy from Group 2 struck first. The moment Figer, his jaw twisted, grimaced and glared at the boy, dozens rushed at him and slammed him to the ground.

"W-wait! Stop it!"

Figer, facing reality, shouted, but the children's resentment wasn't easily quelled.

Group 1 cadets were receiving the same treatment everywhere. Even boys from outside the group joined in thoroughly beating them down.

"H-help! Instructor! Instructor!"

Tess looked back at Rian, who was calmly observing the battlefield, and laughed.

"Hehe, sorry about this. I feel like I just stuck a fork into food someone else prepared."

"It's fine. I hate playing hero anyway. That's why I called you over on purpose."

"Huh? You really didn't know?"

When Rian looked confused, Tess realized it was true and made an incredulous expression.

"Are you stupid? There's no way the instructors would let us run wild freely. This whole situation is probably being reported right now."

Tess's prediction was accurate. Figer received a fracture and was expelled, and other Group 1 children who sided with him also received expulsion notices despite completing their probationary period.

And Rian... despite his poor training scores, was admitted to Kaizen Sword School as 1st place among the 30 successful candidates.

Recalling her first meeting with Rian, Tess raised the corners of her mouth and grinned broadly.

"That same Rian is now hovering around last place."

"Shut up. Why are you suddenly bringing up old stories? Who asked to be made first place?"

"Hehe, still, it's amazing. I would have fallen into self-loathing, but seeing you train every single day without rest."

"Self-loathing? Don't be ridiculous. I graduated from that long ago."

"Still, aren't you worried? You did get admitted, so you need to graduate and make a name for yourself as a swordsman. At this rate, you won't achieve anything."

"...You're really determined to crush my spirit, aren't you."

"What are you talking about! I'm saying this because I'm genuinely worried. And curious too. What drives you to keep going."

Rian looked up at the sky and thought. What drives me? When he considered it, he was in a more comfortable position than other cadets.

"It would be nice to make a name as a swordsman, but it doesn't matter if I don't. I just need to become strong. For my lord."

"Lord? What are you talking about?"

"Ah, I took a knight's oath."

Tess's eyes widened. It felt like asking the kid next door who they'd marry and being told they already had a fiancé.

"Really? You're not even twenty yet?"

A knight's oath was a sacred vow a swordsman could make only once in their lifetime. Therefore, choosing a lord required careful consideration of their future and potential.

"Will it be okay? What kind of person are they? Do I know them?"

Tess assumed it must be someone famous. A war hero, a palace minister, or at least a regional lord. To entrust one's entire life, shouldn't it be someone at least that significant?

"Shirone."

"Shirone? Hmm, Shirone... I don't know them. What do they do?"

"My friend. He's currently attending a magic school in our hometown."

Tess's jaw dropped in disbelief. A friend? And not even a proper mage, but a student?

"What on earth were you thinking? No matter how close you are, there's no need to take a knight's oath. Wait, don't tell me...?"

Tess suddenly became anxious. There was one case where people took knight's oaths to those who weren't famous or promising.

"This Shirone child... is it a girl?"

"Are you crazy? What are you thinking? No matter how lacking in talent I am, I wouldn't take a knight's oath for that reason."

"Really? Hmm."

Tess sighed in relief.

"Anyway, don't speak carelessly. I believe Shirone will become the greatest. That's why I staked my life on it."

Today, Rian seemed different somehow. Honestly, it was just male camaraderie, but unless someone was truly exceptional, they wouldn't go as far as taking a knight's oath.

'Who could it be? This Shirone...'

At that moment, a good idea flashed through her mind. She had been wondering how to bring up a certain topic, and this Shirone provided the perfect opportunity.

"Can't I meet him sometime? This Shirone?"

"What? Why would you want to meet my friend?"

"You brag about him so much, I'm dying of curiosity. In a way, he's got his job secured before even graduating, right?"

"That doesn't make it reasonable to meet him out of nowhere. Besides, Shirone is in Creas. That's incredibly far from here."

"So what? The semester ends in just a few days. My family's in occupied territory anyway, so I don't have anyone to meet. I could just go sightseeing in Creas. Oh right, there's an island south of there, isn't there? It's a tourist spot I've always wanted to visit. Let's go there with Shirone."

Tess spoke smoothly, as if she had prepared everything in advance. Hearing this, Rian's mind changed. Of course, he had no desire to travel alone with Tess, but if Shirone was involved, that was different.

"Hmm, with Shirone... But wouldn't it be awkward with three people? He's not particularly sociable. Especially with girls."

At Rian's positive attitude, Tess's eyes sparkled. The same person who usually wouldn't listen even halfheartedly had suddenly changed, making her feel somewhat jealous.

"Tell Shirone to bring someone too. There must be girls he knows at the magic school. We'll go as a group of four. A double date trip. How about it?"

A double date trip. It did sound fun. More than anything, Rian had been planning to spend time with Shirone after the semester ended, so there was no reason to refuse.

"Well, let me think about it."

Though he said that, it was practically permission already. Tess nodded with a satisfied expression.

"Great. Then shall we end the final practical evaluation with a flourish for our vacation?"

Most cadets had finished their practical evaluations, and now it was Tess's turn.

"Number 47, Elzaine Tess. Ready for evaluation!"

Standing at the starting line for the obstacle course, Tess shouted, and Kuan bent his finger to signal.

"Go."

Tess broke through the limbo-like lowering obstacles at full sprint. However, she couldn't help but freeze before the blade obstacle lower than sitting height.

Though she had mastered Schema earlier than others, today was her first time with external gravity.

Due to Schema's nature of affecting the physical body, mastering it during adolescence was almost unheard of. Even if possible, it wasn't a recommended method.

Tess calmly executed the First Impact. The shockwave rising from striking the ground transmitted through her Schema.

'Here, I shift my center of gravity outward!'

External gravity wasn't magic. It was simply creating powerful inertia to overcome gravity. With that confidence, Tess leaned her upper body back.

'Got it!'

Tess's body traced a fan-shaped trajectory as she passed under the blade. It wasn't luck. All the training she had done without using external gravity until now had created this result.

"Number 47, Elzaine Tess. Obstacle course complete!"

As Tess spread both arms and reported, applause erupted from the cadets. But with her heart pounding, she couldn't hear anything.

'I did it. This actually works?'

Kuan's instruction hadn't been in vain. He had intended this from the beginning when he trained them.

'Even if he's a psychopath, a teacher is still a teacher.'

Having perfectly executed even urban warfare movement, Tess proudly took first place. With few participants remaining, it seemed unlikely anyone would surpass this score.

"Number 52, Ozent Rian. Ready for evaluation!"

When Rian's turn came, Kuan's brow furrowed. He didn't expect much anyway. But perhaps for that very reason, he was a peculiar cadet who somehow created anticipation.

"Do it."

Rian kicked off the ground and charged forward. He passed obstacles that didn't require Schema at an excellent level. But the problem was the final obstacle.

'First Impact!'

He stepped hard on the ground while leaning his upper body back. Simultaneously, Kuan's eyes flashed.

Rian thought something was strange. For some reason, the blade seemed to be approaching his neck.

'Huh?'

Kuan flew at tremendous speed and kicked Rian in the face. Rolling across the ground, Rian couldn't get up for quite some time. As he struggled to raise his upper body, the angry instructor limped toward him.

"You bastard! Are you crazy? Do you want to die? Where did you sell your Schema to go sticking your neck into a blade?"

Coming to his senses, Rian jumped up and shouted.

"I'm sorry! But I did it! Schema..."

"What nonsense? Don't you know what Schema is? Those who can't do Schema are excluded from practicals!"

"No! I definitely succeeded! I took the strength enhancement test and passed!"

"What? Strength enhancement? Where are you lying about..."

The strength enhancement test verified Schema by lifting twice one's body weight. Looking around, Kuan calculated Rian's weight and found something appropriate.

"Hey, come here and try lifting this."

It was a large stone left over from constructing the training ground.

Rian took a deep breath and walked over. Honestly, he had barely passed the strength enhancement test by giving his all, so he couldn't help but be nervous.

"Huuuuu!"

Embracing the stone, Rian used all his strength to straighten his back. Balancing on trembling legs and raising his arms, the heavy stone rose above his head.

Kuan pressed Rian's body with his fingertips. As the muscle fiber action transmitted through vibration, his expression darkened.

'Damn it.'

It wasn't Schema.

Having trained countless cadets, this was the first time he'd seen someone so completely lacking in talent.

No matter how different their aptitude, students receiving education at top facilities would normally master at least Schema. But Rian couldn't even do that.

Of course, if someone lacked talent, they could just be dismissed. The world was full of aspiring swordsmen.

But Kuan didn't want to abandon Rian. He was the type who made you feel that way.

'How much must he have trained...'

He didn't dislike this kind of person. No, as a swordsman, this willpower deserved respect. But one problem blocked everything. No talent. If there was even a little, he could work with it, but there was absolutely nothing.

"Rian, I hate to say this, but you haven't mastered Schema."

The cadets' expressions turned incredulous. It was the first time in six months they'd heard the word "sorry" from Kuan's mouth.

"That can't be! Look, I'm... I'm holding this stone! Then what the hell is this?"

Kuan sighed and said.

"That's... just your stupidly strong natural muscle strength."

Rian made an incredulous expression. After a moment, the stone he was holding fell with a thud.

Ozent Rian. Confirmed last place.
