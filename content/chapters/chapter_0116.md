The first half of the magic school year had ended.

There had been many incidents and troubles, but as the semester came to a close, the atmosphere was warm and pleasant.

The teachers were also exchanging jokes with their students while waiting for the time to return home.

At sword schools that focus primarily on physical training, rest is taught to be as important a virtue as practice itself. But magic schools that train the mind didn't overlook this fact either.

The mind, though invisible, was undeniably a function equipped within humans. Even the most persistent students needed the leisure to cool their overheated heads.

However, since the tension couldn't be completely released, Alpheas Magic School required students who hadn't given presentations to write papers on free topics.

Of course, this didn't apply to Shirone. Having received the highest score with his presentation on "The Invisible" at the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society event, he could enjoy his vacation with a light heart.

On the first day of vacation, as students departed one by one, Shirone visited the empty Third Training Ground.

The place that had been noisy every day with incantation sounds and magical explosions now flowed with only tranquil silence.

The Third Training Ground was among the larger training facilities. A 1,600-meter track ran around the perimeter, and the area divided into eight sections was equipped with various devices to test magical effects.

Shirone entered the movement magic training area. There are countless movement spells that mages can use - Teleportation, Fly, Darkport, Air Walk, and many others. The best environment for practicing all these spells was simply a barren open space.

There, Shirone reflected on his achievements over the past six months.

'First, movement magic.'

Shirone's main movement magic was Teleportation. From there, he had advanced further to acquire Rainbow Drop, which enabled curved movement, and the Patrol technique for high-speed left-right movement.

Among his achievements, photon output couldn't be overlooked either.

Initially just a magic for transmitting information, it had transformed into the powerful attack magic Photon Cannon after he realized divine particles.

Thanks to this, he could easily master flash magic that maintained light for extended periods.

Shirone wasn't satisfied with that and continued evolving. He had mathematically reversed Photon Cannon to develop Laser.

While Photon Cannon might have higher single impact force, Laser's cumulative damage was nearly infinite. It was a terrifying magic that could destroy any solid object unless it was a material unaffected by laser wavelengths.

'Come to think of it, I've worked quite hard too.'

Shirone smiled contentedly. What made him happiest was that his level in specialized magic had taken a leap forward.

Currently, Shirone's photon theory had surpassed sub-light speed and reached the realm of near-light speed. The reason Shirone had come to the training ground was also to attempt spatial teleportation, which was said to be impossible without being a near-light speed mage.

"I wonder what it feels like?"

It was on a completely different dimension from Teleportation. From spatial teleportation onward, he had heard you could distinctly experience the special properties of light where spacetime folds.

As he deployed his Spirit Zone, the surrounding scenery was clearly felt through synesthesia. Concentrating his consciousness on a single point, Shirone cast photon magic at near-light speed level.

The moment he combined omniscience and omnipotence and tilted the center, his body evaporated into light. A flash shot high into the sky, then instantly plummeted to the ground.

Arriving at his destination, Shirone exhaled roughly with a pale face.

"Huff! I... I did it!"

His heart raced rapidly at the sensation he was experiencing for the first time in his life. The scenery that entered his vision was completely different from Teleportation.

When casting Teleportation, you feel as if the world is crumpling and rushing toward you. But spatial teleportation felt like the world had folded, with sky and earth rotating.

'So this is spatial teleportation. I can't think straight at all. At this rate, I can't use it in combat.'

He had heard that even Ethella, a certified 6th-grade mage, mainly used Teleportation in her battle against Arcane. Ultimately, it was proof that spatial teleportation wasn't effective in combat.

Spatial teleportation truly shined not in battle situations, but in travel situations.

When moving long distances, casting Teleportation risked collision with obstacles. Therefore, no matter how wide the Spirit Zone, most mages used intervals within 10 meters as their standard.

But spatial teleportation could literally leap through space regardless of obstacles.

Of course, to see visible effects, the radius of the Spirit Zone would need to be incomparably wider than it was now.

Currently, Shirone's Spirit Zone had a diameter of roughly 50 meters. It was a respectable size among students, but felt insufficient for handling advanced magic like spatial teleportation.

In the end, his magic level had become too high compared to his Spirit Zone. Usually, magic follows the level of the Spirit Zone, but Shirone, being an unlocker, had leaped over theoretical barriers with his outstanding insight.

'The balance has become asymmetrical. Should I be happy about this?'

Of course, the growth of his Spirit Zone wasn't insignificant either. While the size was similar to when he first enrolled, the durability itself was different.

If asked to deploy a zone at the level from six months ago, even a 100-meter diameter wouldn't be a problem.

But attempting to cast advanced magic in that state would shatter the zone. Therefore, it was reasonable to think of the zone's radius as still being 50 meters.

'Haha, people would laugh if I said I was doing spatial teleportation with a zone this size.'

By rough calculation, for spatial teleportation to be effective in actual combat, the zone's diameter would need to be at least 200 meters.

If a mage received an urgent mission to travel 10 kilometers, reaching it with Teleportation would require a staggering 1,000 casts. But a mage with a 200-meter zone diameter could cover the distance with just 50 spatial teleportations.

Being able to reduce casting time by 950 attempts in actual combat situations where every second counted was tremendous efficiency.

"Learning only powerful magic isn't everything. Without Spirit Zone support, you can't become an excellent mage."

Moreover, even when training the Spirit Zone, simply widening the radius wasn't the answer.

You had to increase size while maintaining enough durability for your main spells to function. Additionally, to improve magical accuracy, you had to consider density as well.

"Good heavens..."

Shirone stood there dumbfounded. The path ahead of him felt like it stretched to the horizon's end.

Zone radius and durability, omniscience and omnipotence, application and proficiency, combat experience and judgment - the skills a mage needed to master were endless.

What thrilled Shirone most was realizing that all these skills had to rise simultaneously while maintaining balance.

Upon realizing this fact, he began to faintly see what path he was pursuing and what magic truly was.

Shirone felt exhilarated.

Sensing substance, however dimly, in the nearly infinite world of magic was proof of growth.

Siena, Ethella, Arcane - they were all the same. They had all reached their positions through tremendous cultivation. Though it would be a treacherous path, he didn't think it was a broken bridge.

'I can do it. I can climb higher.'

Having successfully advanced to Class Four, he could apply for the graduating class anytime from next semester. And when he finally graduated, he would become the mage he'd dreamed of.

"I'll become a mage..."

Shirone's heart raced just from imagination. Once, he had thought he'd have to live his entire life in the mountains. But now it was different. The dream he had so desperately wanted was becoming reality.

"Come to think of it, so much has happened."

When he first entered school, he had been mistreated by his peers for not being able to handle a single spell. As a counter-reaction to that, hadn't he even taken an exceptional Teleportation test?

"Haha! Thinking about it now, I was really pathetic."

Shirone left the movement magic training area and entered the cutting magic practice ground in the fourth section.

It was a place for testing magical cutting power, where viscous cylindrical targets floated above magic circles.

Shirone approached a target and extended his hand.

"Wind Cutter."

A strong wind whirled simultaneously with his incantation. Sharp wind slashed the target, and with a slicing sound, the cylinder was bisected.

Air-element specialists trained with viscosity set to maximum, but for Shirone attempting it for the first time, he was satisfied just with the magic's success.

"Hehe, this much is simple."

Currently, Shirone's omniscience had become incomparably stronger than when he first enrolled.

Having passed all subjects with scores above 80, basic magic like Wind Cutter was no problem.

Of course, knowing omniscience didn't mean everyone could achieve omnipotence. The reason he could manifest magic he attempted for the first time was because Shirone's nature leaned more toward insight than analysis.

Mages could be broadly divided into theorists and intuition-based types. While each had their advantages and disadvantages, when first attempting any task, intuition-based types inevitably learned faster than theorists.

Shirone particularly belonged to the side with extremely distinct tendencies. The reason Arcane had once said Shirone was the type who learned through actual experience stemmed from this.

Having reviewed his six months of achievements, Shirone smiled with satisfaction. Even by his own assessment, he now seemed to have become quite mage-like.

"Hey, Shirone!"

"Huh?"

Looking around the track, he saw Nade and Iruki waving their hands.

Delighted, Shirone was about to run toward them when a fun thought occurred to him and he stopped.

He then converted his Spirit Zone to target form, calculated the distance to his friends, and cast spatial teleportation.

With a creaking sound like metal scraping, Shirone's body instantly dropped in front of the two.

"Whoa! What was that? What did you just do?"

Nade jumped back in surprise. Iruki also widened his eyes, not having expected it.

"Don't tell me that was spatial teleportation? Were you practicing until the last day of the semester?"

Shirone answered sheepishly.

"No. I won't be able to practice in the training ground for a while. I just stopped by to review one last time."

"But you succeeded at spatial teleportation for the first time today, right? That's really amazing. Do it once more."

As Nade made a fuss, Iruki clicked his tongue.

"What's so amazing? It's not like you're seeing it for the first time."

"No, I think this is the first time I've seen someone our age cast it. When teachers did it, I just thought 'oh, I guess that's how it is,' but seeing Shirone do it feels different."

"Well, spatial teleportation is difficult magic even for graduating class seniors."

There was a reason they were called specialists. While Teleportation was basic for mages, spatial teleportation onward was close to specialized territory.

Of course, like Teleportation, spatial teleportation was also classified as overpowered, so certified 6th-grade level mages would necessarily master it.

But no matter how specialized, executing near-light speed at student level was far more difficult than expected.

"But for now, there's really no use for it. The movement distance is too short."

"Why is there no use? At least you surprised Nade."

"What? When did I get surprised? I can do Plasma too. Want me to show you here?"

Nade bristled, but the cards were already on the table. Iruki waved his hand dismissively and said to Shirone.

"Forget it. Anyway, to summarize, this is it, right? You were casting amazing magic in an empty place, falling into self-absorption?"

Shirone's face reddened. While he had only been reviewing six months of achievements, in some sense Iruki's words weren't wrong.

"No, I wasn't doing that..."

"Well, you're qualified to do that much. You're the person who showed the greatest growth this semester after all. Anyway, now that you're satisfied, let's go pay our respects."

"Ah, right. Time has gotten so late already."

Most students had returned home, but a few remained at school like Shirone's group. They wanted to express gratitude to the teachers who had worked hard during the semester.

The three left the training ground and looked for the building where the faculty stayed. They could see all the dormitory doors were open and cleaning staff were cleaning each room.

Shirone found the conference room. As expected, numerous teachers were having tea and chatting before departing for their hometowns.
