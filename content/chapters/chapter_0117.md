"Huh? What are you all still doing here instead of leaving?"

Shirone and his friends, who had been standing awkwardly, entered the conference room and bowed their heads when Siena acknowledged them.

"Ah, we wanted to say goodbye before leaving. Thank you for teaching us this semester."

The elderly teacher burst into hearty laughter.

"Haha! It's amusing to hear such words from the school's biggest troublemakers. Anyway, you all worked hard too, putting up with everything. Play hard during vacation. After all, students should be good at playing as well."

Siena, who had given up her seat to Shirone's group, poured tea while offering kind words.

"Congratulations to all three on your promotion. You'll be busier next semester, won't you? It's good to rest, but don't let your guard down. I'll be watching you closely when school starts."

As expected, Siena never just let things slide.

But for a teacher who would freeze the classroom just for being noisy, these were gentle words. It seemed the teachers had also relaxed now that the semester was over.

"Yes, we'll work hard."

As Shirone held his teacup and savored the tea, Thad, who was standing beside him, asked Ethella.

"Teacher Ethella, if you have time, would you like to have a meal with me...?"

Shirone nearly spat out his tea.

Even for a playboy, hitting on a nun was going too far.

Ethella also seemed flustered, giving an awkward smile while waving her hands dismissively.

"I'm sorry. I have to manage parish affairs during the vacation."

"Ah, I see. If I could receive guidance from a beauty like Teacher Ethella, I'd want to join the Carsis Order immediately."

Ethella was dumbfounded. Unless one was insane, they couldn't say such things to a bishop of the order.

But true to her nature of pursuing goodness, she maintained her courtesy to the end.

"Hehe, that's unfortunate. So what will Teacher Thad be doing during vacation?"

Siena intercepted the answer.

"Hmph, he'll probably go around chasing women somewhere."

Thad's brow furrowed.

Why did this woman always pick fights with him over everything? It seemed she couldn't rest easy unless she was causing trouble right until the last day of the semester.

Since getting angry would mean losing, Thad shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly.

"Haha, falling in love at my age isn't something to be ashamed of. I'm more worried about Teacher Siena. With that prickly personality, it'll be hard for her to find a partner."

"What did you say?"

"What else? I'm saying you lack charm. I can tell just by looking. You've never even been on a date with a man, have you? That's exactly because of your prickly personality."

Siena glared and shouted.

"Don't jump to conclusions! I've dated men before!"

The unexpected statement made all the teachers turn to look at Siena simultaneously.

Even Shirone and his friends, who knew about her heartbreaking relationship with Armin, couldn't help but be surprised.

"Teacher, really? When? What kind of person did you date?"

Thad held his stomach and laughed.

"Haha! Kids, do you believe that? She's just making excuses because she's embarrassed. Isn't that right, Teacher Siena?"

"You're looking down on me. I really have dated someone!"

"Oh really? Then who was it? It wouldn't be rude to ask for a name, would it?"

Siena gritted her teeth and glared at Thad.

She didn't want to lose to this man above all others.

"Ma..."

"Ma?"

Everyone's ears perked up.

"I'm dating magic."

Siena's face flushed bright red.

They say when people get stubborn, they'll say anything beyond reason, and this situation was exactly that.

The conference room atmosphere became solemn as the red-faced teachers turned their heads away.

Thad also wanted to escape the situation but barely managed to endure and respond.

"Ah, yes. I understand."

"Are you mocking me now? I plan to dedicate my entire life to magic. Is that a bad thing!"

"No, I'm sorry. I seem to have misspoken."

Thad quickly gulped down his hot tea and turned away from Siena.

Watching this scene, Shirone's group covered their mouths and tried not to laugh.

This was a side of their teachers' daily lives they'd never been able to see before.

"Everyone's still here instead of going home."

"Oh, Headmaster!"

Alpheas entered the conference room.

Having had his teaching credentials suspended, he'd been staying in the dormitory and came by after most students had left.

"The troublemakers are here too. You all worked hard this semester."

"It's thanks to your excellent leadership, Headmaster. We're grateful too."

"Hehe, am I still the headmaster? A temporary headmaster dispatched from the Magic Association will come starting next semester. Please treat that person well, just like you did me."

Nade's face became gloomy.

No matter how he thought about it, it didn't seem like anyone better than the current situation would come.

Without even mentioning the saying that old officials are good officials, Alpheas could be called the best headmaster.

"I wonder what kind of person it will be? At this rate, won't next semester become even more difficult?"

"Haha! That's possible. But you can have confidence. What you achieved this semester was remarkable. You'll do well next semester too."

As the teachers finished their tea and began packing their belongings one by one, Shirone's group also prepared to leave.

"Headmaster, we'll see you when school starts."

"Yes. Go on trips with your families and have a good rest. Oh, and Shirone, could you spare me a moment?"

Shirone, who had been following his friends out the door, turned around.

Nade pointed at the door with his thumb and said.

"Then we'll wait outside. Hey, Shirone, we'll be in the hallway."

"Okay, got it."

In the empty conference room, Shirone had a private meeting with Alpheas.

His expression was quite serious, so Shirone also tensed up and waited for him to speak.

"The reason I asked to see you is because of Miro."

"Ah, I see."

Shirone recalled Miro's appearance.

Although he'd been busy with hectic days after his promotion was confirmed, her impression still remained strong in his mind.

"I'm curious about something. Do you still want to investigate Miro?"

"Yes. I'll need to discuss it with my parents, but I'm trying to make time if possible. Since it's vacation anyway, if not now, there might not be another opportunity."

"I see. It will be a good experience."

Alpheas readily gave permission.

But there was an unsettled aftertaste on his face.

"Is that why you called me?"

Alpheas finally brought up what was really on his mind.

"No, actually I called you because there's something I want to ask. Can you tell me what Miro's condition was like at that time?"

"Condition... you mean her mental state?"

"Yes. Her mental state, but anyway, I want to hear in detail about how Miro appeared to you."

Shirone recalled the events of that time.

Although their meeting was brief, it had been such a major incident that he remembered even the trivial conversations he'd had with her.

"Hmm, thinking about it, her emotions seemed to... change rapidly. At the time, I overlooked it because she was such a mysterious person."

"To what extent? Was it serious?"

"No, not to that degree. Though I think there were times when it felt a bit chilling."

Alpheas let out a quiet sigh.

Complex emotions that Shirone's short life couldn't describe were conveyed.

"Did Miro seem lonely?"

"I asked her the same thing at the time, but Miro said that gods don't feel loneliness."

"Gods don't feel loneliness. Hmm."

A shadow fell over Alpheas's face.

Perhaps Miro had wanted to convey something to him through Shirone's words.

'No, is she conveying it to them...?'

Shirone observed Alpheas carefully.

What could have happened to make him have such a serious expression?

But since he'd promised not to dig deep, he couldn't ask directly.

"If you're that worried, Headmaster, I won't investigate the ruins either."

Alpheas finally awakened from his reverie.

Come to think of it, he'd been too absorbed in his thoughts while keeping someone sitting there.

"Huh? No. The Kergo Ruins are a tourist site, so go see them if you get the chance. You'll be able to get a rough idea of what kind of world Miro lives in."

"Does that mean there really are secrets hidden there? But it's a tourist site, isn't it?"

"Haha! It wouldn't be fun if I told you everything. But you must never let your guard down. I'm allowing this investigation because I trust your abilities."

Shirone realized there was substance to his words.

Alpheas was someone who gave students freedom. But precisely because of that, he also had a mischievous tendency to condone moderate dangers.

"Yes. I'll investigate thoroughly."

After saying goodbye to Alpheas and leaving the conference room, Shirone met up with his friends waiting in the hallway.

"Shirone, what did you talk about?"

"About Miro, whom I mentioned before."

"Ah, come to think of it, you said you were curious about that person, right? Kergo Ruins, was it?"

"Right. But after hearing what the headmaster said, I became even more curious. I'm going to make time to go see it."

"That's a shame. We'd like to go with you too."

"No. During vacation, you should spend time with your families."

"Tch, we're not kids, so who cares about that? The problem is we'd be half-dead if we didn't go home."

Nade stuck out his tongue as if the mere thought was horrible.

Iruki's situation was similar. Since his father was the head of the Thunder Dragons, he couldn't act recklessly when outside.

"Still, I'm really curious. To think that person named Miro was the president of our research society - strictly speaking, she's my direct senior, right? I wonder if she was watching me too?"

Iruki shattered Nade's innocent wonder.

"Shirone already said it. Unless you enter the Immortal Function, contact itself is impossible. She's probably staying in some middle dimension between this world and that world."

"Aw, I wanted to meet her and pay my respects."

"Well, you might be able to see her before you die. Anyway, it's time for us to part ways now. Take care, everyone."

Three carriages were waiting where Iruki pointed.

Among them, the splendid twin-horse carriage sent by the Mercordain family stood out.

"Ooh, as expected of a first-class noble family. The class is different."

"Shut up. It's all a waste of money. Plus, that thing is slow as molasses."

The three friends exchanged farewells.

Although they would see each other again soon, when the time to part actually came, feelings of regret washed over them.

"Shirone, Iruki. I'm going to miss you. This is the first time I've hated vacation like this."

"Will you be okay? Can you endure it?"

Iruki asked with concern.

Knowing what kind of place Nade's household was, he could imagine how much fear Nade must be feeling right now.

But unexpectedly, Nade smiled brightly.

This was different from last semester. It was probably because he was taking with him an armful of happy memories from meeting Shirone.

"No problem. I'll go back and reorganize first, then really start having fun next semester. Everyone stay healthy and take care."

The three who had shared joys and sorrows for half a year walked to their respective carriages, waving their hands.

"Great! Then see you on the first day of school!"

* * *

One week earlier.

Kaizen Sword School, like other sword schools, had also finished its first-half training.

Rian received the worst report card, but perhaps due to his naturally positive personality, his steps toward home were light.

Though he wanted to return to his hometown immediately, he had to retrieve his belongings from his sister's house, so he was reluctantly heading toward the royal palace area.

'Damn it, I have to meet that witch again. If I'd known this would happen, I should have left my stuff at grandfather's house. She'll try to kill me when she sees my report card.'

Rian opened the mansion's door, hoping that Reina would be away.

Befitting a recognized artist in the royal court, the mansion was large and luxurious. But for Rian, it only made the escape route unnecessarily longer.

As he tiptoed through the hall like a cat burglar, piano music rang out loudly, crushing Rian's expectations.

"Damn it! She was home after all?"

The sound of the keys was so loud that even his voice was drowned out.

Reina sat at the grand piano decorating one side of the hall, completely absorbed in her performance.
