After becoming a disciple of Merchen, the melody pianist, her skills improved by leaps and bounds.

She had become sensitive enough to detect even the subtle air pressure fluctuations around her Schema, and her fingers leaped across the keys so fast they were barely visible.

Reina's performance was something even the proud royal family praised.

But to Rian, who had been losing sleep to that sound since childhood, it was nothing but murderous noise.

"Damn, the witch has gotten stronger. But humans don't die from something like that."

Reina seemed to hear nothing but the sound of her performance.

Her protruding lower lip showed she was deeply concentrated.

Her hair was disheveled and her eyes were sunken from staying up all night.

She was only wearing underwear, leaving her thighs fully exposed.

She had actually been playing piano for 17 hours straight.

It was a funeral march famous across the continent for its high difficulty, and she had recently hit a wall that was giving her trouble.

For artists, barriers are both a curse and a blessing. They appear just before one's skills are about to improve.

In such cases, Reina would stay up for days to overcome the barrier.

Rian glimpsed new hope.

If he could sneak into his room and just pack his things, then whether he jumped out the window or broke through the wall, he just needed to escape.

'Alright, stay calm. I'm going home.'

Rian slowly moved along the blind spots of the grand piano.

If he could just make it to the stairs, the operation would be a complete success.

Of course, Reina was sitting right on top of her little brother's head.

The moment hope lit up Rian's eyes, she once again cut off her performance without fail.

'Ah, damn it.'

Reina spoke without even turning her gaze.

"What have you been doing since earlier? Do they teach people how to be funny at sword school these days?"

"Tch, if you saw me, you should at least pretend not to notice. And what the hell is that getup? A grown woman playing piano in her underwear? Don't mock art."

"Acting up again. That kid really needs another beating."

Despite her threatening words, Reina picked up her skirt first.

Only family members knew that the more stressed she got during practice, the more clothes she would take off.

"Hehe, so you are embarrassed in front of your little brother? Ugh!"

The moment Rian burst into laughter, Reina's sole struck his face.

Though Rian had trained hard, it was still a speed he couldn't even react to.

"Damn it. What the hell are you doing? Ptuh ptuh!"

As Rian brushed off his mouth, Reina extended her hand.

"Hand it over, your report card."

Rian's face hardened.

What was bound to come had finally come.

"Wh-why does sister care so much about my report card? I'm all grown up now. Ow ow ow!"

Reina grabbed Rian's ear and shouted.

"Won't you hand it over? Want to die today?"

"Ah, fine! Here, here!"

Rian pulled out his report card from his inner pocket and threw it on the floor.

Then he ran to his room without looking back.

"Geez! That kid needs more discipline. When will he ever grow up?"

Reina picked up the report card and unfolded it before her eyes.

The training subject scores were listed in order, and at the end were the total number of students and his overall ranking.

Reina's hands trembled as she confirmed the ranking.

Dead last!

Not second to last, but truly dead last.

'This can't be. No matter how pathetic he is, he does try hard.'

Reina flipped over the report card to check the homeroom teacher's comments section.

As she read through the text, her eyes filled with shock.

"We regret to inform you that your child has finished the semester with the lowest grades.

Currently, Rian believes he has opened his Schema, but the faculty has determined this to be merely a placebo effect caused by increased muscle strength.

This is a phenomenon called imaginary Schema, which is extremely rare but can occasionally occur. This is a time when warm family attention is needed."

"Geez, really! I can't live like this!"

Reina crumpled up the report card and stomped upstairs.

She burst through the door to find Rian sitting like a bear, packing his things.

"Hey! You're dead last!"

"Ah, I don't know. That's what happened."

"And imaginary Schema? What the hell does this mean? So it's like... imaginary pregnancy... something like that?"

"I guess so."

Rian answered as if it had happened to someone else and continued with what he was doing.

From the moment he revealed his report card, he had transcended all worldly concerns.

Reina glared at Rian, boiling with anger inside.

Unable to contain herself, she mercilessly pounded on Rian's back.

"Geez, you little brat! Die, die!"

"Ow! It hurts!"

"Is this that hard? You just need to open your Schema!"

"I don't know! What am I supposed to do when it won't work! I did my best too. Anyway, I'm leaving, so move aside. I might miss the carriage."

"Go where? Stay right here! Once I finish up here, I'll go down with grandfather, so you come with us then!"

"No way! I have a promise to keep!"

"A promise? What kind of promise could someone like you have? Do you still want to play around after seeing these grades?"

Rian almost played the Shirone card in his surge of emotion.

But he held back to the end. This was something he must never tell Reina.

It was none other than a couples' trip.

If Reina heard that Shirone was going with a woman, she would definitely interfere by any means necessary to prevent it.

'Ugly thing is just full of jealousy.'

At first, he had hoped his sister and Shirone would get together, but now he felt like breaking them up wouldn't be enough.

A gentle and calm woman would suit Shirone much better than this witch.

"What kind of promise? Speak up!"

"A promise with a woman. We agreed to go have fun."

"A woman? What woman would a guy from sword school meet?"

"There are women there too. Elzain Tesla, you know the Elzain family, right? She's their daughter."

Reina knew well of the Elzain family, which had long distinguished itself in diplomatic fields.

But if she was the daughter of such an elite family, she would be proud and haughty.

She couldn't even imagine such a person going on a trip with her brother who had returned home with the worst grades in school.

"Where are you lying? Tell the truth! You have some other scheme, don't you?"

"I don't know, mind your own business! Well, I'm going!"

Rian, who had been focused on stuffing his backpack regardless of Reina's nagging attacks, jumped up and ran away as soon as he got the chance.

"Hey! Stop right there!"

When Reina stepped outside the door, Rian was already running down the second-floor stairs toward the entrance.

Though it wasn't a distance she couldn't catch up to if she activated her Schema, Reina let him go with an annoyed expression.

It was confidence born from the fact that she could control Rian, who had been her plaything since childhood, from ten thousand ri away.

"Hehe. Yeah, go ahead and take your carriage. Let's see who arrives faster."

Behind the fleeing Rian's back, Reina was waving the report card.

* * *

After seeing off his friends, Shirone walked to the carriage sent by the Ozent family.

Temuran, the deputy butler of the main house, had come to meet him.

True to form as the person who had given Shirone a hard time when organizing the great library, his stern impression remained unchanged even after half a year.

But his attitude was quite different.

He bowed politely and had a kind smile on his lips.

"It's been a while, young master. You've done wonderfully."

"Deputy butler, it's been a while for me too."

At first, being called young master had felt awkward, but after half a year, it no longer bothered his ears.

Of course, it was still embarrassing.

The two people sitting in the carriage chatted until they reached Shirone's house.

Shirone was particularly pleased to learn how the people of the Ozent family were doing.

"Wow, he already got certified?"

Ozent Rai, Rian's older brother, had passed the certification exam.

Of course, like most 10th-grade swordsmen, he wasn't in a position to take it easy and was living hectic days on the front lines.

"Yes. Moreover, Miss Reina has been promoted to conductor of the Royal Palace's 7th Music Corps. She's doing very well. The head of the family is still busy with official duties, and the elder is retiring soon to return to his hometown."

"I see. But I heard Rian has an older brother too? What does he do?"

"Hmm, that's not something I can speak about. Just know that he's a certified 6th-grade swordsman. It's presumptuous advice, but it would be better not to bring up the eldest son even at the main house."

"Ah, I see."

Considering the Ozent family's character, it wasn't a household where family discord would occur.

Still, if it was a story that couldn't be brought up, he thought it might be a political matter.

"Rian is doing well, right? I'll see him soon anyway."

Temuran's answer was the shortest of all so far.

"He hasn't contacted us once in half a year."

"Hahaha! That's so like Rian."

While having pleasant conversation, the carriage had entered the mountains.

Shirone opened the window and enjoyed the scenery of his hometown.

The colorful forest landscape seemed to welcome his return already.

The carriage came all the way into the courtyard of Shirone's house.

It was exactly the same place where Temuran had come to pick up Shirone before.

"Thank you for the ride. I'll visit again soon."

"I only did what I should. Well then, have a good time."

Shirone turned away with an excited heart.

Seeing the humble but warm log house brought new emotions.

'Thank you. I'll be filial during the vacation.'

The closer he got to the house, the more he thought of his parents.

His mother who had suffered so much until now, and his father who hadn't hesitated to kneel to send him to magic school.

Shirone threw open the door and shouted with overwhelming emotion.

"Mom! Dad!"

"Wahaha! Right, right! Beer really is best with pork!"

"Do you think so too, sir? Lamb doesn't go well with beer for me either!"

"That's what I'm saying. Lamb has a fishy taste that ruins the beer flavor. Come, come! Let's have another drink!"

Shirone stared blankly at the living room.

He was surprised by the more festive atmosphere than expected, but the real shock was because of the giant boy sharing drinks with Vincent.

He had grown much taller than before and his hair was shorter. But the strong impression was definitely Rian.

"Shirone! You're here!"

Rian jumped up.

But the person who ran over faster than anyone was Vincent.

The moment he hugged him, the smell of alcohol wafted up. He must have drunk quite a lot.

"Oh! Our son is here! Are you hurt anywhere?"

"Ugh, the smell of alcohol. What's going on all of a sudden? Why is Rian at our house?"

"He stayed for two whole days to see you. He helped with the wood cutting and went hunting together. How was it? Wasn't it fun, Rian?"

"Hahaha! Of course, father! A real man should know how to hunt!"

Shirone was dumbfounded.

The father he knew wasn't someone who would treat a noble so casually, even if he was his son's friend.

What kind of bonding had happened in two days that the two were having a drinking session before lunchtime?

Shirone escaped from Vincent's embrace as he rubbed his beard and shouted at Rian.

"You were out of contact, weren't you? Did you stop by the main house?"

"No, why would I go to the main house? This is my lord's house. Isn't that right, father?"

"Don't be ridiculous! What trouble did you cause this time?"

"Wh-what trouble did I cause?"

Though he pretended innocence, Shirone could tell just by looking at Rian's face.

It wasn't that he wouldn't go home, but that he couldn't.

Shirone sighed and entered the living room.

'Sigh, this isn't right...'

The father-son reunion he had looked forward to had ended up as a drinking session.

But seeing his father looking thinner than before, he thought it was fortunate in a way that he didn't cry.

"Oh my, Shirone's here. Come here, my child."

Olina embraced Shirone with her warm chest.

Thinking that indeed only mother could be trusted in this world, Shirone was finally able to have a greeting to his taste.

"Mom, you suffered a lot while I was away, didn't you? I'm sorry."

"What suffering? The Ozent family helped us a lot."

Olina patted Shirone's back while glaring at Vincent.

She didn't like how he was drunk when their son had come home for the first time in half a year.
