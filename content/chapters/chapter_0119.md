Oblivious Rian fanned the flames of Olina's burning heart.

"Father, instead of just sitting here, let's go cut some wood right now. To commemorate Shirone's visit!"

"Puhahaha! Should we? Alright, let's have the three men burn it up properly!"

"Honey! What wood cutting when you've been drinking? Go inside and sleep it off first."

"Mom, it's okay. I'll go and come back."

Shirone readily accepted. Since things had come to this, it seemed fine to properly catch up.

On the other hand, Olina couldn't put her worries to rest. While Vincent was strong with alcohol, climbing mountains while drunk was extremely dangerous even for experienced mountaineers.

"Will you be alright? What if you get hurt?"

"I'm here, so it'll be fine. I'll be back before lunch."

In the past, he would have followed Olina's words, but the situation was different now. He had even faced terrifying Ulks to protect children, so such worries wouldn't come to pass.

Olina found this side of her son unfamiliar. He definitely looked brighter than before, and his words and behavior overflowed with confidence.

Was this the power of education? He had been a good son, but there were many times she couldn't tell what he was thinking. Now he had become a completely different person. Most importantly, it seemed he had learned to love himself a little more.

Once Olina gave her permission, the three men set off for the logging area, exchanging stories they hadn't been able to share. Rian especially quickened his pace, wanting to show off his progress.

Having stayed at Vincent's house for two days, Rian had heard stories of Shirone's childhood. Among them, the Thunder Strike had been particularly impressive. When he had faced Shirone at the main house, he had struggled against the sword energy, which made him even more interested.

Upon arriving at the logging area, Rian shouted.

"Alright! Then shall we strike some wood like real men? How about it, Shirone? Want to bet with me? The loser grants the winner's wish."

Rian, whose build had grown larger than before, could handle a two-handed axe with just one hand without strain. To exaggerate, if Rian was an old tree, Shirone was like a squirrel standing beside it.

"Sure. Why not."

Shirone readily agreed. He had never lost a bet to Rian. When the loser was challenging him, the winner couldn't run away, could he?

When Rian raised his axe and nodded to Vincent, Vincent also gave a signal by raising his thumb from under his folded arms.

"Then I'll go first."

Rian swung his axe with all his might. With a thud, the tree trunk shook violently.

What devastating destructive power. It showed just how harsh his training had been for the past six months.

"Wow, amazing. Is that Schema?"

"Huh? Ahaha! Of course not! I wouldn't need to use Schema just for chopping wood, would I?"

Rian's answer seemed somewhat awkward, but Shirone decided to let it slide for now.

Rian raised his axe again. Then he turned to look at Shirone and winked.

"The real thing starts now."

Rian's axe struck the area where the bark had been torn away once more. With a crack like thunder, the tree fell in one blow.

"Thunder Strike..."

Shirone realized immediately. The fact that Rian had succeeded with Thunder Strike meant he had also become capable of sword energy.

"Uwahahaha! How about that, Shirone? I'm not the same as before!"

Despite his bold shout, Rian's heart was pounding. Honestly, there had been a slight chance of failure.

He had learned sword energy at sword school, but his success rate against people was considerably lower.

However, thanks to hearing Vincent's explanation of Thunder Strike and practicing all day, he had reached the point where he succeeded nine times out of ten against trees.

"Amazing. The Thunder Strike I do is different in power from the start."

"This much is a natural result, I suppose? Anyway, a bet is a bet. Since I succeeded in two attempts, you have to knock it down in one try!"

Vincent burst into hearty laughter.

"Haha! Shirone, give it your best. If it's a tie, we keep going until someone wins. At this rate, we might have to shave down an entire mountain!"

Vincent thought Shirone would be formidable too. While Rian's strength was impressive, Shirone had shown natural talent in technical aspects since childhood.

"Here, use my axe."

"No, it's fine. I'll just do it like this."

Shirone approached the tree and extended his hand. Vincent and Rian looked puzzled. How could he fell such a thick tree without even an axe?

Shirone gauged the position and entered his Spirit Zone. Then he struck the tree with Wind Cutter, a basic magic spell.

From inside the tree trunk came a sharp cracking sound.

That was the end of it all.

As the two watching men tilted their heads in confusion, Shirone slowly pushed the tree. The log fell over, revealing a clean cut surface.

"Yahoo! I won!"

While Shirone jumped excitedly, Vincent and Rian stood with their jaws dropped wide open.

How could a tree be cut without any visible strike? It would be impossible unless magic was used.

'Ah, that's magic.'

Rian examined the base of the tree Shirone had cut. Even a sword training student couldn't cut so smoothly.

"What kind of magic is this?"

"It's called Wind Cutter. It creates wind to make the air sharp, and it's actually one of the most basic of basics."

Vincent was at a loss for words at his transformed son's appearance.

Of course, since he had sent him to magic school, he had roughly guessed that he would learn a spell or two, but he had honestly thought it would be at most circus-level tricks.

But to cut a log in one go. Depending on how it was used, this was practically a lethal weapon.

"Good heavens. I can't believe it. Can you teach Dad too? If I cut wood with that magic, I'd earn much more than now, wouldn't I?"

At Vincent's innocent words, Shirone smiled awkwardly.

"While it is basic magic, it's not something you can learn that easily."

If one mastered Wind Cutter, cutting over a hundred trees a day would be natural. But no magician in the world made money by cutting wood.

Even if they cut a thousand trees, a magician's daily wage was much higher. It wasn't that the value of a thousand trees was low, but that magicians' salaries were high.

Realizing this fact, Shirone felt good. When he first enrolled, he had great fear of failure, but now he felt reassured knowing that even if he couldn't graduate, he had skills to support his family.

Others might think a magician who had opened Immortal Function was crazy, but family was that precious to Shirone.

"Anyway, since I won, I'll state my wish. Rian has to carry the wood back to the house."

"Tch! Can't be helped. I was going to carry it anyway."

Rian chopped the fallen tree into pieces, then prepared to return with the A-frame carrier on his back.

Though he had lost the bet, a smile hung on Rian's lips as he descended the mountain. Shirone had personally proven that his eyes hadn't been wrong.

'Amazing, Shirone. Of course, what you showed today isn't your everything, is it?'

When they returned home, Olina had prepared various foods. It was truly a feast of delicacies, with edibles from land, sea, and air all seeming to be present.

"Wow, looks delicious. Thank you for the meal!"

While eating, Shirone told them about what had happened at school.

He naturally omitted the life-threatening situations, but there had been so many other events besides those.

"...So the answer ended up being number 3 after all. Hahaha! Thanks to that, I'll be advancing to Class Four from next semester."

"Ah, I see."

Contrary to expectations, Vincent and Olina showed little reaction. When Shirone, thinking he had more to say, finally spread his hands and spoke as if realizing something.

"It's incredibly amazing."

Only then did color return to both their faces. Since they had never attended school, they couldn't understand even half of what Shirone said, but their joy at their son's achievement was no different from any other parents.

"Ah! So that's what it means? Congratulations, Shirone!"

"Well done, our son. Mom was so worried."

Olina lifted the tablecloth to wipe away tears.

Rian watched the scene of this loving family with a pleased smile. He could see where Shirone's calm disposition had originated.

"But Rian, why did you really come here?"

"Oh, right. Come to think of it, I came here because I need to ask permission from both of you."

"You can say anything. If it's something we can help with, we should naturally help."

Though he said that, Vincent was quite worried. What kind of permission would a noble family's son seek from a woodcutter?

"Can I take Shirone out to play? For about a week or so?"

Shirone turned his head in bewilderment.

"What, play? Why are you talking about something I don't know about? Where are we going?"

"Galliant Island. Don't worry. I've already made plans."

"Huh? Galliant?"

Shirone's eyes widened. He was surprised to hear from Rian's mouth the place that had been on his mind lately.

"When you were working at the library, you were stuck inside without being able to move. Let's get some fresh air with this opportunity. It's close to Creas too. It'll be fun. Galliant Island is one of the world's most popular resort destinations."

"Plus there are the Kergo Ruins."

This time Rian was surprised.

"Huh? You knew about them?"

"No, I only knew that ruins existed there, nothing more. Ooh, so it was such a famous place. This is unexpected."

Shirone, who had been searching maps for the past few days, had discovered that the Kergo Ruins were on Galliant Island. He had a vague feeling about ruins, but remembering that he had decided to visit since they weren't far away.

Shirone glanced at his mother. He had been thinking of going once during vacation, but if a son who had returned after six months immediately said he was going out to play, the disappointment would be great.

But as always, Olina followed Shirone's wishes.

"Go ahead. We're completely in favor."

"But Mom, I was going to help Father with his work when I returned from school this time..."

Vincent burst into hearty laughter.

"You rascal! Did you go to war or something? You came back from school, so it's natural to go play during vacation. If a young man only looks for his parents too much, that's no good either."

Shirone pouted with a sheepish expression. Of course, magic school was definitely a school, but the dangers he had experienced there were no exaggeration to say they rivaled a battlefield.

"Then, can I make it ten days?"

"Huh? A whole ten days? It's fine, but it's not really a place worth sightseeing for that long, is it?"

"Ah, actually I have something I want to investigate separately."

Rian made a disgusted expression.

"Studying there too? You're really something else."

Since Shirone had completely read through all the history books in the Ozent household, studying at a resort would be nothing to him.

'Hehehe, but this time won't be easy. Will studying really catch your eye there?'

Thinking of his secret weapon, Rian smiled secretly and looked forward to tomorrow.

* * *

Shirone packed his travel bag and went to bed. Since Rian had decided to stay until today, the two laid out bedding on the floor and lay down side by side.

"By the way, tell me. Why didn't you go home?"

"Huh? Oh, that's..."

Rian trailed off. Just as Reina was keeping track of her younger brother, Rian knew his sister well too. She would probably send his report card home to try to keep him there.

But he couldn't tell Shirone the truth. While he wasn't ashamed of being last since he had done his best, his mouth just wouldn't open.

"Just some minor family issues. Hahaha."

Shirone didn't press further.

"Anyway, it worked out well. I was planning to go once during vacation anyway."

"You said Kergo Ruins, right? What kind of investigation are you planning?"

"I don't know yet. I'll enjoy the vacation as a vacation, so it's fine. First I'll play with you on the island, then stay behind alone to investigate later."

Rian sensed something unusual. Kergo Ruins were a tourist site. If it were just simple investigation, Shirone wouldn't tell him to go back first.
