"But Shirone... if you're really planning to do something on the island, there's one problem."

"Huh? What problem?"

"Actually, I prepared this vacation as a couples' trip."

"Couples' trip? You mean like guy-girl, guy-girl pairs?"

"Yeah. My partner is supposed to come here. I should have mentioned it earlier. I never expected you to say you'd investigate the ruins."

Shirone looked up at the dim ceiling. A couples' trip. That meant he would need to bring a partner too.

"Got it. I'll bring someone along as well."

Rian turned to look at Shirone with surprise. The Shirone he knew would blush just from seeing women's underwear - a complete innocent. He had held back from speaking, thinking finding a partner would be the biggest obstacle, but Shirone had unexpectedly agreed so easily.

"You... are you popular with girls?"

"Huh? It's not like that. But I do have someone I could go with. Actually, I was thinking about it. If you hadn't suggested this, I would have asked first."

Rian's eyes lit up. He didn't know what intention was behind those words, but didn't it mean there was a girl he had his eye on?

"Haha! Our family witch would be hurt if she heard that!"

"Reina? Why would she be?"

"Hehe, never mind. Anyway, I'm dying of curiosity. What kind of girl is she? Is she pretty?"

"Yeah. She is pretty, but... I don't know if she'll come with me. She might reject me outright."

"No way, you absolutely have to bring her. Go tomorrow and get her to agree. In the meantime, I'll go home and prepare."

Shirone delayed his answer. If Rian was bringing a partner, he would have to bring one too.

But he couldn't be certain. Judging by her usual personality, there was a very high probability he'd be scolded and chased away.

Various worries weighed on Shirone's mind. But at the same time, he felt excited.

It would be his first trip, and it was with friends. Moreover, he'd heard that Galliant Island was a famous tourist destination with tropical charm.

Shirone couldn't fall asleep late into the night.

**New Encounters (1)**

Shirone parted ways with Rian in the noble residential district. Since they were departing tomorrow, he had to find a partner today.

Being unfamiliar with this area's geography, he asked for directions to find her house. The place he finally arrived at was a mansion too beautiful to have been built merely for residential convenience.

'This must be the Karmis family's main house.'

Though they talked freely at school, the thought of actually visiting her home made him nervous. The guards at the main gate were looking at him suspiciously, making him even more tense.

"Um... hello?"

"What brings you here?"

As Shirone approached, the guard's grip tightened on his sword. It was an unconscious reaction. After going through countless trials, Shirone's aura had grown to overwhelm ordinary people.

"Is Amy here by any chance?"

The guard's expression hardened. He knew from rumors that Amy was an object of admiration among young men her age. But rarely anyone came all the way to the main house.

"Excuse me, but who are you?"

"Ah, I'm called Shirone. I'm a friend who goes to magic school with her."

The guard looked to his superior as if unable to make the judgment himself. His superior's face became indifferent.

While it was certainly a rare case, for someone who had lived at the Karmis main house for twenty years, it wasn't particularly unusual.

'Sigh, what a bother. Starting again right after vacation begins.'

Anyway, as long as the main house hadn't issued orders to strictly forbid outsiders, he had no choice but to report it.

When the superior gestured with his chin to go notify them, the guard personally rode his horse toward the mansion.

Shirone waited anxiously at the main gate. Meanwhile, the superior glanced at Shirone sideways.

He seemed to have decent looks and a good personality, but he wouldn't be able to enter the mansion anyway.

Countless men had been rejected so far. There had even been cases where people distantly related to royalty returned without even seeing Amy's face.

It would be unimaginable unless it was the Karmis family, whose name was known throughout the continent.

After waiting about ten minutes, the guard came back in a hurry on horseback. The superior could predict the result just by looking at his subordinate's worried face.

In times like these, it was always the gatekeeper guards who faced difficulties. If a noble who couldn't control their anger decided to get physical, they had no choice but to take a beating.

The superior made up some words thinking to ease his subordinate's burden.

"How did it go? I heard there's something that needs urgent attention today."

"Um, she says to bring him in."

"Mm, I see. They're such busy people... Huh? What did you say?"

The superior asked again, doubting his ears. The guard making the report also seemed bewildered as this was his first time encountering such a case.

"Well... Miss Amy said to bring him over."

"Ah, she must be home then. That's fortunate."

Shirone let out a sigh of relief. If Amy had been out, there would have been no way for a commoner like him to enter the mansion.

Shortly after, a pink carriage arrived at the main gate. When a kindly old man got out of the carriage with a walking stick, the guards' faces turned pale.

It was Adel, the head butler of the Karmis family.

Seeing someone had come to greet him, Shirone asked the guard.

"Can I go in now?"

"Ah, yes! Welcome to the Karmis family estate!"

The superior hurriedly offered a military salute. Even so, he couldn't understand the current situation.

Granting entry was one thing, but Adel? No matter who Shirone was, even if he were from a great family, there was no reason for the Karmis family's head butler to come out to greet him.

Adel only moved when there were major family events or when the head of the family had guests.

'Who exactly is he? He said he's the young lady's friend, so he can't be the family head's guest. Is there some event today? No, I never heard anything like that.'

Adel walked toward Shirone with his walking stick. He had a gentle expression for a head butler managing such a grand mansion.

"Welcome to the Karmis mansion. I am the head butler, Adel."

"Hello. I'm called Shirone."

"I see. If you'll forgive the impertinence, there's something I need to confirm before escorting you to the mansion."

"Ah, what is it?"

"I need to verify your identity. Whether you're truly Mr. Shirone."

Shirone looked at Adel with incomprehension.

"The young lady said this: 'If it's Shirone, bring him over.' I interpret this statement as follows: Only if it's truly Shirone can entry be permitted. Therefore, you must show me proof that you are indeed Mr. Shirone."

Shirone felt anger rising. Amy's words about bringing Shirone over were just her grumbling way of speaking, and at most meant to check because someone might be impersonating the name.

How much did he have to stretch that interpretation to demand proof of identity?

"How do I prove that I'm myself? I am Shirone."

"That alone isn't enough for me to be certain. I am the head butler of the Karmis family. I have the duty to clearly establish the identity of visitors, and I also have the authority to do so."

"Just take me to Amy...!"

Shirone stopped speaking. Adel's previously kind face suddenly began to seem frightening, and an unidentifiable energy pressed against his chest and back. It felt like his organs might burst.

"The Karmis family is the highest nobility that refuses comparison with other families. Moreover, I, Adel, as head butler, follow only the family head's orders. Since I've personally come to escort the young lady's guest, you must show corresponding sincerity."

Shirone realized why Adel was being difficult. Ultimately, it meant he was displeased at having to do something that even an ordinary butler could handle. Still, he couldn't show his displeasure because the energy crushing his lungs was growing stronger.

'Ugh... finally it begins. Pressing.'

The guards felt sympathy for Shirone. Adel, notorious for being strict, would often call subordinates over for pressing if they made even minor mistakes.

Pressing - abnormally amplifying emotions and transmitting them to the opponent to disrupt their nervous system.

While it didn't cause physical pain, the gradually amplifying stress affected the body, and if properly applied, it could destroy vital organs - a dangerous technique.

'Ho, he's withstanding even this?'

Shirone was tense but showed no particular major changes. Annoyed by his composed manner of enduring the stress, Adel gradually increased the intensity of the pressing.

Originally he hadn't intended to go this far, but he thought it would be a good lesson to startle this youngster who was acting cocky just because of his family background.

Shirone realized his heart was beating faster. The main cause was anger. Adel's hostility was drawing out Shirone's rage.

'Stay calm. It's just emotion after all. If I can control it, nothing will happen.'

Like a person sinking into the sea with a boulder attached, as time passed the pressure increased and breathing became difficult.

But Shirone didn't struggle and calmly observed his own emotions.

When the pressing's duration exceeded the critical point of death, Adel's lips trembled in disbelief.

Cold sweat was flowing down his forehead.

'What is this child?'

To escape from pressing, one had to amplify emotions with the same intensity.

If it were the Karmis family's Insight, they could reset emotions themselves, but for Shirone, who had no photographic memory, to remain fine for this duration was definitely strange.

'Patience alone cannot explain this. Then what remains is perfect control over one's emotions.'

It was another method of breaking pressing. But it wasn't as easy as it sounded.

As the saying goes that even a saint would lose composure if exposed to stress for a long time, any sage would become disturbed and lose their equilibrium. But Shirone showed no such signs at all.

Based on his experience, Adel hypothesized several situations. Either an idiot, insane, or a monk.

No, even among monks, one would need to reach at least the Diamond Vehicle level.

'Diamond Vehicle? Does that make sense? Isn't he not even twenty yet?'

Though he didn't acknowledge it, Adel had essentially hit the correct answer.

In the infinite realm, Shirone had gone insane a number of times no human could possibly endure.

The absolute center he had awakened through that process.

As long as he held onto that, he could ignore any artificially generated emotions.

Adel released the pressing. Whatever method he had used to endure it until now, from now on it was something he didn't dare need to know.

The boy standing before him was definitely the young lady's friend.

As Adel's face returned to its kind expression, Shirone could finally exhale.

What a terrifying technique. If he hadn't reached the Diamond-like Indestructibility level, his heart might have burst.

Adel placed his hand on his chest and bowed.

"Please forgive this foolish old man's rudeness."

The guards were bewildered. They had thought it strange that there was no change in Shirone's expression, but suddenly the head butler was apologizing with a humble attitude.

"When you return to the mansion, please scold me for my actions. I will gladly accept any punishment. So please let go of your anger."

"Didn't the family members suspect me?"

"Yes. Both misinterpreting the instructions and putting Mr. Shirone in danger were entirely my independent actions. The family head placed no conditions whatsoever on bringing Mr. Shirone over."

"Why? Did I do something that displeased you?"

Adel smiled and shook his head.

"Quite the opposite. Though I've attended Miss Amy since her birth, this is the first time she's ever brought a man into the house. I was curious about what kind of person you might be, and presumptuously committed this rudeness."

Shirone felt deflated. All the previous actions had been an act to test him?

But it wasn't really something to scold about. To visit a noble's mansion, especially the main house, one absolutely must make an appointment beforehand.

Having worked for the Ozent family, Shirone could guess how weighty Adel's responsibilities were.
