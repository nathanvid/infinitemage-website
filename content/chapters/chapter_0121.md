"I understand. So I can meet Amy now?"

"Of course. The young lady is waiting for you. Please get in the carriage."

As the carriage departed, a beautiful garden with roses blooming in abundance spread out beyond the window.

If the Ozent family expressed their traditions through grand, direct approaches, the Carmis family's way seemed to be free-spirited. Unique, individualistic works that ignored uniformity and standards were erected throughout the garden.

"It's really magnificent. It's like entering a dreamland."

"I'm glad it pleases you. The Carmis garden has traditionally reflected the tastes of all family members for generations. We designate areas and decorate them to individual preferences. This could be called our unique family tradition of valuing personal individuality. The artificial fountain you're seeing now was proposed and built when Miss Amy was ten years old. We call it the Rainbow Fountain."

Shirone stuck his face out the window. As the cone-shaped fountain sprayed water, the droplets scattered light, creating a beautiful rainbow.

"Haha! Rainbow Fountain. That's so like Amy."

Adel watched Shirone admiring the garden with kind eyes. He could guess why Amy's face had brightened compared to before when she returned home after finishing this semester.

"The Carmis family possesses an ability called Insight. Thanks to it, they excel far faster than others in whatever they do. Knowing this fact, family members generally don't interfere with each other. Even regarding the Arcane incident, we received a report, but the family head only confirmed the young lady's safety and instructed us to leave it be."

Shirone's mouth fell open in bewilderment. To leave it be even though his daughter's life had been in danger. He could feel how magnanimous the Carmis family's perspective on the world was.

"Of course, it's not that there's no affection between family members. It's just their nature, but Miss Amy, being the youngest, sometimes couldn't understand such family members. When she was even younger than now, she went through a period of wandering."

"Ah, I know about that. But I didn't know there was such a background to it."

Shirone recalled his first meeting with Amy. When he was bullied in an alley around age twelve, he had harbored much resentment. But that was all in the past now, and learning even the circumstances behind those events made him feel closer to her.

"Looking at the young lady these past few days, I think she's changed a lot from when she was young. Now she's come to enjoy her own pursuits like the other young masters in the family, you could say. It's probably thanks to you, Master Shirone. Thank you."

Shirone could read sincerity in Adel's bowing figure. Indeed, if someone had cared for Amy since birth, they couldn't have only the emotions of an employee.

The reason he had evaluated Shirone so strictly also stemmed from this. Of course, jealousy over losing his beloved granddaughter-like figure also played a considerable part.

"I'm sorry for making you lose face. The head butler shouldn't have had to come out to meet me."

"Master Shirone, you are kind. But you needn't worry. Miss Amy gave permission for entry, I was just a butler who happened to be passing by that area, and the family head simply instructed anyone available to go see immediately."

Shirone was curious about the Carmis family members. If even the head butler thought so preciously of Amy, how strictly would her family treat him? The thought was somewhat frightening.

"Ugh. I'm getting nervous. I hope I won't be turned away at the door."

"Hehe! It will exceed your expectations. But since that's their nature, please don't take it too badly."

While they chatted about this and that, the carriage arrived at its destination.

Shirone followed Adel into the mansion. A splendid hall decorated with countless works of art welcomed him. On both sides, winding staircases curved like snail shells up to the fourth floor.

"Master, Miss Amy's friend has arrived..."

"Kyaaak! Amazing! He's really a man!"

A woman who looked exactly like Amy slapped her own cheeks and shouted. It was Isis, the family's matriarch.

True to being a dancer who had made a name for herself in the kingdom in her youth, she still looked young despite being over fifty. But perhaps because of that? Every action carried a distinctly immature feeling.

"What? Shirone was a man?"

"Me too! I want to see too!"

Two men rushed over from the corridor connected to the living room. They were the eldest son Diane and second son Ares.

Diane looked young for someone in his mid-thirties, and Ares, two years younger, had grown such a full beard that his bare face was unimaginable.

Both stared intently at Shirone as if they couldn't believe it. Just looking at their shocked eyes, one could tell how confused they were.

"Uh, excuse me... Hello. I'm Amy's friend, Shirone..."

"Now, let's skip the introductions and come over here quickly. Honey, Amy's boyfriend is here."

Isis grabbed Shirone's wrist forcibly and sat him on the sofa. Someone was waiting there. It was Shakora, the head of the Carmis family, whose name even Shirone knew.

He had been a person wielding tremendous influence in political circles, but was said to have retired after becoming disillusioned with all sorts of corruption.

"Hmm."

When Shakora lowered his newspaper, an intelligent appearance was revealed. He was the tallest among the family members and had perfect physical balance despite his age.

Shirone broke out in cold sweat like a rabbit that had jumped into a lion's den. The gazes examining his body as if appraising a work of art were unbearably burdensome.

When the men's eyes glowed red, Shirone gulped. The sight of three people simultaneously activating their Insight was quite terrifying.

'Ugh, they're remembering. They're storing me in their minds.'

Knowing the ability of perfect memory, Shirone felt like shackles had been placed on him. Perhaps they would be able to recall this moment forever, transcending time and space.

"Um, hello?"

Unable to bear the awkward atmosphere, Shirone mustered his embarrassment and greeted them again. Only then did the Insight fade from the men's eyes, and as if waiting, Isis clung to him.

"Wow, he's handsome. Is this real? Are you really Amy's friend?"

"Yes, that's right."

"Oh? Then you're also in the graduating class?"

"No. I'm in Class Five."

"Hmm?"

Isis furrowed her brow. The brothers also tilted their heads. Flustered, Shirone felt he had to add something more and opened his mouth.

"But from next semester, I'll be in Class Four."

"Aha!"

Suddenly, the three people broke into bright smiles. The same expression, the same reaction. Shirone fell into a panic state. It seemed they hadn't been interested in classes from the beginning.

'Where on earth is this? Who are these people...?'

Shirone suddenly recalled Adel's words.

-It will exceed your expectations. Please don't take it badly.

Adel's advice wasn't a lie. But it was a family that exceeded expectations in a different sense than Shirone had thought. Should he say they had a pleasant yet eccentric disposition?

"When did you meet Amy? You're dating, right? Huh? Do you hold hands and walk around at school too?"

"What? No, well..."

Shirone stalled for as much time as possible. Since Amy's position took priority here, it was better to be sparing with words.

"What's all this commotion? What are you all doing surrounding him when the person involved isn't even here?"

A voice from upstairs saved Shirone, who was on the verge of collapse. Amy was looking down at the hall from the second-floor spiral staircase.

Second son Ares twitched his beard and said,

"Oh? You changed clothes? When we told you Shirone came, you frantically ran to your room."

Amy preemptively blocked misunderstandings.

"So what? Should I have met him in pajamas? Anyway, everyone disperse. Dad, is it okay if I talk with my friend?"

"Go ahead. Isn't this the first boyfriend you've brought home? It's the Carmis way to try everything possible so you won't have regrets later. Hahaha!"

Even at Shakora's mischievous joke, Amy didn't bat an eyelash. If she wavered even slightly, they would persistently dig in, so it was important not to give them any opening.

Even as Shirone climbed the spiral staircase, Isis's questions continued.

"Amy, tell the truth. He's your boyfriend, right? You're dating, right? Right?"

Amy quickened her pace as if she couldn't hear anything. But the mother who had passed her blood to her daughter was just as persistent as Amy.

"Don't be like that and talk to me a bit. What's your relationship? You two are dating, right? Right?"

"Ugh!"

Finally unable to bear it, Amy shouted fiercely and headed for her room.

Isis's mouth hung open dumbly. Even Shakora seemed surprised this time, raising his gaze to look up the staircase.

But the two figures had already disappeared from view.

Shirone and Amy, who had entered the room, sat awkwardly facing each other with a table between them.

Shirone first looked around the room. The study was full of magic books, and in corners not reached by his gaze, several unopened romance novels were stuffed away.

'Haha! Those must be the ones Senior Seriel lent her.'

Though she was known as a tomboy at school, her room was surprisingly feminine. His eyes especially went to a large doll sitting on the bed. It was a bear doll with fiercely torn eyes.

"You have a doll. A bear doll too."

"So what? Can't I have dolls in my room?"

"No, it just seems to resemble you. Haha!"

Amy clicked her tongue and shut her mouth. Honestly speaking, she couldn't think of what to say. This was also her first time showing her room to a man outside her family.

"But is this really okay? We pretend to date at school, but there's no need to lie to your family too."

"Don't worry about it. They wouldn't be interested anyway. They're just doing that because they find it amusing among themselves."

As Amy said, it was a free-spirited and unique family. But he could vaguely sense that beneath what wasn't shown, they were connected by love between family members.

"Enough silly talk. What brings you to our house all of a sudden? Do you have something to discuss?"

"Actually, that's..."

As Shirone was about to speak, the door slid open. Isis's face crept in through the narrow gap.

"Oh my, did I interrupt at a good moment? Have some tea while you talk."

Isis moved her feet stealthily while setting tea on the table. Even while doing so, her eyes remained fixed on Shirone.

As Shirone was about to speak again, the door opened once more and this time Diane entered.

"I brought some snacks..."

Diane's gaze also wouldn't leave Shirone. The sight of his body walking forward while his head turned sideways was comical.

Amy sighed. Since this had never happened before, it would be amusing from their perspective.

Her brothers, who showed no interest in anything but extraordinary events, had never once had their younger sister's boyfriend visit the house.

"Fine. Just all come in. I know you're all waiting outside."

As soon as Amy's words fell, feet pushed the door wide open. Ares could be seen standing with plates in both hands.

"There was some fruit... Haha."

"Just come in since we've come this far. Since it's turned out this way, let me introduce him properly. Shirone, that's okay, right?"

"Ah, of course."

Thus, all family members except Shakora came to sit across from Shirone.

"This is Shirone, a promising student at the magic school. And Shirone, this is our mother. She was a dancer in her youth."

"I see. No wonder you're so beautiful."

"Hohoho! Amy takes after me. But don't fall for me. I don't want to hurt my daughter."

"Ah, yes."

Shirone said he understood. No matter how he thought about it, there was no other response.

"And this is my eldest brother Diane. He's a certified 5th-grade swordsman and serves as captain of the palace guard. He came down to his hometown because he has something to consult with Dad about regarding political matters."

When Amy finished speaking, her family members looked at her as if surprised.

Even if he was her boyfriend, there was no need to mention internal family affairs. In the end, it was proof that despite pretending to be calm, she was also nervous inside.
