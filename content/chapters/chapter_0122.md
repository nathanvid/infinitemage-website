'Hehe, so this boy makes my daughter nervous? The great Amy herself.'

Though the Carmis family's nature was generally open-minded, Amy's personality was particularly bold. The reason she could handle street gangs even as a child wasn't simply because she was nobility.

Her brothers shared the same thought as they stared intently at Shirone. The idea that their sister, who never listened to her older brothers, was being mindful of some outside boy stirred up feelings of jealousy.

"This is my second older brother, Ares. And what he does for work is..."

Amy asked back with genuine curiosity.

"What exactly do you do for work anyway, brother?"

"Hahaha! I'm an explorer. I excavate ruins and create maps while traveling through remote areas. The dragon's nest in the Alphonse Mountains and the crystal caves at the northern frontier of the Corona Kingdom are prime examples of my work."

"Ah, I see. I know about the Alphonse Mountains too."

The Alphonse Mountains, known as a habitat for various dragons, was a place so filled with danger and adventure that it appeared in literary works.

Rian had once mentioned wanting to visit the Alphonse Mountains while reading a novel called "Dragon Knight."

"That's really impressive. I heard it's an extremely dangerous place."

"Romance comes with danger lurking around. I'm satisfied with my work. The pay is decent when map-making succeeds. Though Amy seems to dislike it."

"Please, at least shave that beard. You're not unemployed, yet when you hole up at home, you won't think about going out for months."

"Don't be so harsh. Anyway, this time an expedition team is being formed, so I won't be back for two years. I waited this long just to see my beloved sister's face."

"Hmph..."

Amy turned her head away as if it was ridiculous. Seeing this, Shirone chuckled softly. Even calling him unemployed or whatever, the truth was she worried about her explorer brother.

Once he set off on an adventure, it easily took over a year, so from the family's perspective of not even being able to confirm whether he was alive or dead, they couldn't help but be anxious.

"Still, I think it's cool. I'd definitely like to try that kind of adventure someday."

"Once you fall into it, you won't be able to get out. You'll be able to do things ordinary people can never experience in their lifetime until you're sick of them. Come find me anytime after graduation. I'll specially put you on an expedition team."

"Oh please, enough! Don't put ideas in the kid's head, and if introductions are over, everyone get out."

As Amy issued her order to leave, the family began firing questions like wildfire. This was when things got interesting—they couldn't possibly leave before it even started, could they?

"But what did you like about Amy? You didn't cross any adult lines, did you?"

"Huh? No, well, that's..."

"Amy's personality isn't ordinary—how did you approach her? Did you melt her with words? Or did you manly grab her in a secluded spot and kiss her hard...!"

Amy's eyes blazed red.

"I said get out, didn't I?"

A scurrying sound was heard, and before long, only Amy remained in the room. They had fled so frantically that the door was still rattling.

'I can tell what kind of personality she has at home.'

As the bustling room became desolate, the contrast effect of the silence grew larger.

Having missed the chance to speak, Shirone looked around the room awkwardly.

Amy also hid her face by pretending to drink tea, lost in thought. It was so awkward she was breaking out in cold sweat.

'Why exactly did this guy come here?'

She couldn't possibly have anything to say. Even if there was important business, Shirone visiting her home was truly unexpected.

"What is it? If you came, then talk! You didn't come here out of boredom to hang out."

Shirone turned his gaze from the scenery to look at Amy.

"Ah, actually I came because I have a favor to ask. But now that I'm here, I feel like it was rude to visit without any notice. I'm sorry to your family."

"Forget it. What's wrong with coming to a friend's house? Anyway, what's this favor?"

"If you have time... would you like to go somewhere fun with me? To Galliant Island."

Amy froze with her teacup in hand. She hadn't expected it, couldn't even imagine it. For Shirone to be the first to suggest going somewhere fun. And with a girl. And to an island.

"So, you're saying you and I should go to an island?"

"Actually, I have a friend named Rian. That friend made the suggestion first. But Rian is bringing a friend too, so I also need a friend to come with me. So four of us would be going."

"Oh? Is the friend Rian is bringing... a girl?"

"I think so. Huh? How did you know?"

Amy swallowed her tea without answering. The situation was being quickly sorted out in her head.

'So basically it's a couples trip. This Rian guy is cunning. Huh? Wait, a couples trip?'

Cold sweat ran down Amy's spine.

'And he's taking me there? Why on earth?'

Even when they were doing their fake romance, Shirone had remained unmoved like a stone, yet suddenly he was proposing a couples trip, which was confusing. If it were simply to make up the numbers, he wouldn't have asked her specifically.

The graduating class was the final competition of magic school, so intense studying was necessary even during vacation.

Knowing this fact better than anyone, if Shirone had come all the way to her house to ask this favor, she could only think he had some special ulterior motive.

"What's your reason for wanting to take me? You have friends in the advanced class too, don't you? You know I'm in the graduating class, right? You also know how much special training other graduating class students do during vacation. So why me specifically?"

Amy was afraid of the answer even as she asked. It surely couldn't be what she was thinking.

But maybe it could be. The hand bringing the teacup to her mouth trembled slightly.

"Amy, no matter how much I think about it, it has to be you."

"Pffffff!"

Amy spat out every drop of tea she was drinking. Shirone, hit by the tea spray, had a dazed expression like someone caught in a downpour.

"What are you suddenly saying! You stupid idiot!"

Amy wiped her mouth with her sleeve and shouted. Her face red as a persimmon, she fled from her seat and returned with a towel.

"Wipe yourself with this quickly! It's disgusting, really!"

"...You're the one who spat on my face. Anyway, continuing the story, do you remember the person called Miro I told you about before?"

"Huh? Miro? You mean that person who was the first president of the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society? You said you met her during the Immortal Function."

"Right. It's a hypothesis I've recently formed, but I think the Immortal Function is related to faster-than-light speed. So I became interested in learning about her. The headmaster gave permission saying it would be fine to investigate the Kergo Ruins to that extent, so since Rian suggested it, I thought I'd go take a look."

Amy finally regained her peace of mind. The Kergo Ruins were famous ruins and tourist attractions on Galliant Island, weren't they?

"Ah, so you want to investigate that place together?"

"Of course, I don't think it will be dangerous. But hearing the headmaster's words, I also think it's not just a simple tourist spot. If you came with me, I think I could feel at ease too."

Since Rian had proposed a couples trip, the partner had to be a woman. But even excluding that condition, Amy was the strongest person among the friends Shirone knew.

The uniqueness of Insight was also a tremendous strength, but with her skills that had secured a place in the middle ranks of the graduating class through daily competition with strong opponents, she could navigate through any dangerous situation together.

"Hmph! Of course! I'm on a different level from those supernatural whatever kids."

"No, I didn't mean it that way, but anyway..."

Shirone smiled awkwardly and mumbled. Amy actually knew too. That he wasn't the type to drag friends into things simply because they were strong.

Shirone had saved Amy from falling off a cliff. That special event that happened in a brief moment had further strengthened the trust between the two.

That's why he could ask this favor. Asking for companionship while knowing the danger was because they had a relationship where they had shared life and death.

"I see, so that's how it is..."

Amy walked to the window and became lost in thought. Since it wasn't a trip for just the two of them, there was no burden. No, rather, that's exactly why she wanted to go.

She would gain a lot from this trip, but more than that, doing something with Shirone seemed like it would be fun.

'The brat does have good judgment. Fine, since I owe him a debt anyway, I'll boost his spirits this time.'

Amy slowly turned around. Seeing Shirone waiting for an answer with a tense expression made her chuckle.

Whatever the purpose of the trip, on the surface it was a matter of taking a girl and staying overnight. Even with sweet words as packaging it was questionable, but if the guy was frozen like he was about to commit some crime, no woman would follow him.

'Nothing's changed from when he was twelve to now.'

When would this child ever grow up? Perhaps all his growth energy had been concentrated on magic.

Amy nodded readily.

"Alright, let's go to the island."

* * *

"Greetings! I'm Elzaine Tess, Rian's friend!"

Tess, who had come to visit the Ozent family, politely greeted them energetically. Beside her stood Rian with an anxious expression.

The reason Rian had been camping out at Shirone's house until now was because he had formed a strategy to storm into his family home using Tess as a shield.

There would definitely be no parents who would easily let their son, who had returned after placing last in sword school, just relax.

But if he put a friend forward, the story would be different. Especially if that friend was the model student who placed first in sword school, it would be calculation enough to be effective.

"Hmm, I've heard much about Elzaine's reputation. Is your father in good health?"

"Yes. Even while staying in the occupied territories, he practices swordsmanship without missing a single day."

Actually, Elzaine didn't know how her father was doing. Nor did she want to know.

But Rian's father Bishop nodded as if that was certainly fitting.

"As expected, someone who has established a family through the sword is different. If the opportunity arises, I'll be sure to visit him."

Tess's father, Elzaine Beron, was a master swordsman called by the alias "Flash."

If Ozent swordsmanship was domineering, then Elzaine swordsmanship was eerie and sharp.

Which skill was superior depended on the one wielding the sword, but the pride in maintaining swordsmanship orthodoxy was incomparable.

"Rian, it's unlike you to make friends with such a fine young lady."

"We're not dating. She's just a friend."

Tess glared at Rian with sharp eyes. But what could she do? As they say, the thirsty one digs the well—if she wanted to travel with Rian, she had no choice but to endure.

"So, you want to go on vacation to Galliant Island?"

"Yeah. I thought I was going to die from how hard sword school was. I need time to recover mentally and physically. Oh, Shirone is coming later too. We're planning to leave directly from here. Can I go?"

"Going is fine, but did you really work hard? A guy who wouldn't listen even with private tutoring saying such things—how can I believe it?"

"Haha! I figured you'd say that, so I brought this. I finally opened my Schema too!"

Rian pulled out his trump card. Though Reina had taken his report card, he still had the certificate for passing the strength enhancement test.

Now that it had been revealed as a placebo effect, it was a useless piece of paper, but Bishop, who didn't know the whole story, had no choice but to believe it.

"Hmm, you really did pass. Congratulations."

Bishop didn't show emotion according to his personality. But his voice was trembling slightly.

Any parent would be more concerned about their disappointing child. Having accomplished the Schema that he couldn't make succeed despite all his efforts, he must have been clenching both fists inside.

"Now, keep your promise. The sword grandfather said he'd give me when I mastered Schema—I can take that, right?"

"Of course. Since you've opened your Schema, you'll have to learn Ozent swordsmanship from now on. But where's your report card? You seem so confident, it must be pretty good."
