"Ah... my report card? My sister has it."

"Reina has it? Why? Go get it."

"I don't know. She snatched it away saying she'd show it to grandfather. How am I supposed to know what that witch is thinking? Anyway, hurry up and give me the sword. I've been working so hard for it since I was little because I wanted it so badly."

The sword Rian desperately wanted was a straight sword specialized for the Ozent family's swordsmanship. It was a great sword twice as heavy as an ordinary longsword, with a blade so long that only someone quite tall could handle it.

From the time he began learning swordsmanship, Rian had been eyeing the Ozent family's straight sword. The particular sword he had claimed as his own was one that his grandfather had used personally.

Clump had wanted to pass the sword down to Rian for some time. Among his grandchildren, only Reina and Rian had inherited the blue-haired bloodline, and excluding Reina who was female, he thought Rian was the only one who could wield his sword.

"The sword is in grandfather's room. But why are you suddenly looking for a sword when you said you were just going to have fun? I can understand Tess since she came from far away."

"I have my reasons. Anyway, I'll go get it now."

Rian ran up to his grandfather's room. Though the sword was too much for him to handle when he hadn't even mastered Schema, he was determined to take it on this trip.

Shirone was definitely planning to explore ruins. Like thread following a needle, if Shirone was going to plunge into dangerous places, shouldn't he be there to protect him?

'This is the Ozent family's great straight sword.'

Rian gazed up rapturously at the great sword hanging in his grandfather's room. A form embodying the soul of the Ozent family, said to be difficult to even swing before opening one's Schema.

Of course, Schema was still impossible for him now. But Rian lifted the sword with just one hand and brought it before his eyes.

'It's heavy. But not to the point where I can't swing it.'

When he received the ridiculous assessment of "imaginary Schema," Rian had felt just as bitter. But true to his nature of never being discouraged in any situation, he thought positively about it.

Schema or not, having passed the strength enhancement test meant his physical power was the same. He would need to open his Schema someday, but his position was that he could manage for now.

Since the sword was so heavy, carrying it in an iron scabbard would be inconvenient. Rian strapped a net-style leather scabbard to his back and inserted the straight sword.

This outfit would certainly attract attention, but since carrying a sword wasn't illegal, it didn't matter.

Except for special zones designated by the city, anyone could carry a sword as long as they followed certain rules.

Commoners were sector level C, nobles were sector level B, and royalty were sector level A.

Rian came down the stairs confidently carrying the straight sword on his back. But he wouldn't get the chance to draw attention.

Head butler Louis opened the front door and reported.

"Master, young master Shirone has arrived."

Shirone, who entered the hall with Amy, first paid his respects to Bishop.

Outwardly strict and taciturn, he was family-oriented enough to take time off work and stay home when hearing his son was coming.

From Shirone's perspective, he was a guardian who had helped him attend magic school, and he had heard that Bishop looked after not only his school life but also ensured his parents' livelihood lacked nothing.

"Hello. Have you been well?"

"Yes. I heard you're doing well at school."

"I've been promoted to Class Four this time. It's thanks to your help. Thank you."

Recalling Rian's past, Bishop smiled bitterly. Class Four? What magnitude of talent would it take to enter Class Four just half a year after enrolling in magic school?

Of course, he wasn't foolish enough to compare children. He was simply worried, as one swordsman to another, whether Rian, who had taken a knight's oath, might not measure up to Shirone's caliber.

"It's because you worked hard. Anyway, it was worth supporting you. I heard Rian is going on a trip with a lovely lady this time, not knowing his place. Are you going too?"

"Yes. We decided to go together."

"Is the lady beside you his partner?"

Bishop turned his eyes to the red-haired girl. She looked familiar, but he couldn't quite remember.

"Hello. I'm Carmis Amy."

Bishop's eyes sparkled. Rian and Tess, as well as head butler Louis, all looked at Amy with curiosity.

The first-class noble Carmis family didn't boast the highest authority within the kingdom alone.

But their free-spirited nature and Insight talent were spread across the entire continent, beyond just the kingdom.

Achievements that weren't limited to any single nation could be said to best represent their identity.

Bishop also didn't think noble rank indicated a family's power. There were plenty of nobles in the world who rose to high positions through all kinds of flattery and base means.

Such people ignored legitimacy and even changed their family traditions while desperately pursuing advancement. But families like Elzaine and Carmis were of a different class entirely.

Legitimacy could only be built through conviction. The pride of those who had chosen only one path since the kingdom's founding couldn't be bought with money or power.

"Now, now. Let's talk later and get going. We need to leave now to make the ship's departure time!"

Rian changed the atmosphere. Though he had gotten permission from Bishop, his anxious heart wouldn't calm down.

By now, the express mail Reina had sent was probably flying toward them like an arrow.

The moment the report card was revealed, heaven would grow distant and the gates of hell would unfoldâ€”that much was certain.

"Dad, I'll be back then. It'll take about ten days."

"All right. You've worked hard training all this time, so go have fun. Oh, and use this for travel expenses."

Bishop tossed him a heavy pouch of gold coins. Looking inside, Rian was shocked. It was the first time he had received so much money from his father.

Bishop was actually in a good mood. When Rian had taken the knight's oath, he thought he was ruining his son, but not only had he mastered the Schema that wouldn't come to him, he had also made good friends.

Moreover, Shirone, who would become Rian's master, was steadily growing based on outstanding talent.

Thinking of training as an investment for real combat, wasn't it appropriate to pay six months' worth of wages?

Rian felt guilty, but even that feeling was a luxury right now. Only the thought of surviving and escaping this house filled his mind completely.

"Got it. I'll go have fun with my friends then. Oh, Temuran. Have a carriage ready to take us to the port."

"Understood. Have a pleasant trip."

Temuran saw Rian off with a pitying expression. Just from how he was sweating cold sweat and escaping like he was running away, the situation could be guessed.

'The time I can hold out is 10 minutes. Good luck, young master.'

Temuran focused on the envelope tucked in his pocket. It was express mail from Reina that had just arrived from the capital.

* * *

Perhaps because the butlers had a lot of work today, there wasn't a single idle carriage available. There was a private carriage, but it would take an hour just to saddle and service it.

Rian said no maintenance was needed, but he had to accept the request to at least check the tightness of the wheel nuts. If an accident happened, all blame would fall on the carriage manager.

The four people waited near the stables for the carriage to come.

For a while, there wasn't much conversation. It was a common situation when everyone was meeting for the first time. But countless analyses were going on in their minds.

Tess first observed Shirone. She knew he was an aspiring mage, but since Rian had taken a knight's oath, she had imagined a hot-blooded youth. But meeting him in person, he was surprisingly delicate and calm in personality.

Amy from the Carmis family was also interesting. The Carmis, called the stars of the continent. What kind of personalities did people from that family have?

Eventually, Tess spoke first. She thought there should at least be no awkwardness when they got into the carriage.

"Shall we introduce ourselves? I'm Elzaine Tess."

"I'm Carmis Amy. Nice to meet you."

"Ah, I'm Arian Shirone."

Tess shook hands with Shirone as well. But upon hearing his family name, she tilted her head.

True to the Elzaine family's specialization in diplomacy, she knew the names of most noble families. But she had never even heard the name Arian in passing.

"Ah, Arian. Um, is your main family in Creas?"

Tess asked indirectly so the other person wouldn't be offended. Reading her thoughts, Shirone honestly opened up.

"Ah, I don't have a main family. I'm a commoner."

"Huh? A commoner?"

Tess's eyes widened like saucers. At first, she wondered if he was talking nonsense from nervousness. Otherwise, why would Rian take a knight's oath to a commoner?

Tess looked at Amy. The lack of emotional change meant she already knew.

'What on earth is going on? What is Rian thinking? And why Amy too? How could someone from a family like Carmis come along as a commoner's partner? Isn't this a couples' trip?'

Having never experienced Shirone, Tess couldn't help but be confused. She was also struck as much by Rian's decision as by her surprise at Shirone.

Even if Shirone had great abilities, not discriminating based on social status wasn't as easy as it sounded.

Moreover, it wasn't just friendship but a knight's oath to serve as master for life.

'In a way... it is like Rian.'

When Tess couldn't find words to reply for a long time, Shirone spoke first.

"Sorry. If you're uncomfortable, I'd rather..."

"Oh, no. I'm the one who was rude. Honestly, I was so shocked I was flustered. But... am I being strange? Everyone else is so calm, it makes me feel like the bad person, hohoho!"

Tess hastily smoothed over the atmosphere. Whether commoner or noble, he was Rian's lord. Then she too shouldn't treat him carelessly.

'Tess is a righteous person.'

Shirone could sense what kind of person Tess was. Was this indeed worthy of the woman Rian had chosen?

Making someone smile while lowering oneself was impossible without sincere consideration.

"Thank you for saying that. I've heard a lot about you. That you're Rian's girlfriend."

"Oh my, what are you saying? Did we really look like lovers? Do we suit each other that well? Hohoho!"

Tess was beginning to like Shirone. Meanwhile, Rian's face turned bright red. It was a misunderstanding that absolutely had to be broken. But since he was glad Tess was being nice to Shirone, he just kept his mouth shut.

Amy looked at Rian with surprise. When she first heard the plan to go to an island, she had wondered what kind of scheming person had made such plans, but he was more honest and considerate than expected.

'The Ozent family, who made their name through swordsmanship alone. I heard there's one genius among the black-haired ones, but this person has blue hair.'

Their noble rank was second class, not royal family, but that was due to their uncompromising, honest nature.

The political world called such families "pure."

It was a term referring to neutrality, and during peacetime their influence on politics wasn't very great.

But when great turmoil struck the nation, the political landscape could change depending on where the pure votes went, making them a force that couldn't be taken lightly.

While Amy was thinking such thoughts, Tess was observing Shirone and Amy.

Both had cute appearances and bright intelligence flashing in their eyes. Moreover, though she didn't know their actual personalities, she got the feeling they were both equally stubborn.

"But what's the relationship between you two? Now that I look, you really suit each other well. Are you lovers?"

When Tess pointed at the two alternately and asked, Amy felt slightly irritated. It seemed like she was being seen as just matching up with other small kids.
