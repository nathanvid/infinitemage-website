Tess certainly had an incredible physique that could match the towering Rian. Her limbs were long and slender, and her tall height gave her waist a deep, graceful curve.

In contrast, he was obviously a mage to anyone who looked at him. His height was average, and his build was rather thin compared to his peers.

Of course, physical beauty wasn't everything when it came to attraction, but standing before Tess, who was a full head taller with such commanding presence, he couldn't help but feel somewhat shabby.

"No, we're just friends too. She's specially doing me a favor by coming along."

"Ah, I see."

Tess didn't believe it at face value. The mere fact that a first-rank noble girl had come along as a commoner's partner was enough to suggest extraordinary feelings.

Rian shared the same thought. In fact, when planning this trip, his biggest concern had been what would happen if Shirone couldn't find a partner.

There was the issue of social status, but his introverted personality also made Rian worry that he might get hurt.

But when it came down to it, Shirone had brought along a girl so beautiful that even he, who had little interest in women, was amazed.

Rian believed that women should have adorable charm that triggered protective instincts, like Amy.

In contrast, Tess possessed skills that surpassed his own, so there was no way he could feel romantic emotions toward her.

Even if it was just Schema ability, there weren't many men who were attracted to women stronger than themselves.

'Go for it, Shirone. I'll actively support you.'

While Rian was making his plans, the serviced carriage arrived. The four of them gathered their belongings and walked toward the carriage.

That's when it happened.

"You brat! Rian~!"

An incredibly loud voice boomed from the mansion. From the murderous intent carried in that sound alone, Rian realized everything had been discovered.

"Damn it! Everyone, run!"

"What? What about the carriage?"

"We'll be too late if we take it! Look behind us! We absolutely have to get over the wall!"

The three looked back toward the mansion. A yellow whirlwind that reached toward the sky was approaching them.

Without understanding the situation, Shirone's group began running.

"Rian! What's going on?"

"Damn it! My report card must have arrived! I actually got last place! Dad's going to kill us!"

"Really? He'll actually kill us? Let's just tell him the truth and then leave. What is this when we're trying to go have fun?"

"Go ahead and try if you're confident. I'm running. For reference, my dad is a certified 4th-grade swordsman."

The color drained from the three faces. Tess activated her Schema and shot forward, with Amy following behind her.

Shirone, who had fallen behind, felt his heart pounding. He was clearly running forward, but the wind was blowing from behind.

The fact that they were pushing through the air while running meant Bishop's speed transcended human limits.

"Rian! I think he's going to catch us!"

"Can't help it! I'll sacrifice myself! You guys go to the island first and have fun!"

That was certainly like Rian to say. But they couldn't abandon their friend and go on the trip. Even in the chaos, Shirone thought of one solution.

"Amy! Let's use Teleportation! Rian, don't move!"

Shirone grabbed Rian and cast photon magic. Their bodies flashed with light and immediately became a beam that shot forward.

Rian, experiencing Teleportation for the first time, felt dizzy. His vision narrowed extremely as all the scenery seemed to rush toward him.

It was exactly a mage's perspective.

Amy must have understood Shirone's words too, as she grabbed Tess and cast Teleportation.

Two streaks of light raced through the garden at tremendous speed. It was a situation where they could crash into cover and be smashed to pieces, but Shirone and Amy didn't allow even the slightest mistake.

Thinking they had gotten quite far, Shirone looked back. But he had to grit his teeth while suppressing the urge to cry.

The whirlwind had gotten even closer. It was destroying whatever cover and obstacles were in its way.

It was only natural that the great straight road, symbol of the Ozent family, came to mind.

"Amy! Come this way!"

Shirone shouted as he made an emergency stop in the middle of a dense forest. Amy also canceled a turn to close the distance to Shirone.

The whirlwind destroying the forest was approaching from 100 meters away.

Tess stamped her feet and shouted.

"What do we do now? Just get caught?"

"Grab onto me! We're going to fly!"

Shirone expanded his Spirit Zone to its maximum radius. Even so, they couldn't escape the grounds, but there was one method.

If they couldn't win on speed, they could momentarily disappear from their coordinates.

"Here we go!"

When his friends arrived, Shirone used synesthesia to search for a safe location. He never thought he'd use magic he thought he wouldn't need for a while so quickly in actual combat.

Targeting the outskirts of the forest, he cast spatial teleportation, and the four bodies burst into light before being sucked into the sky.

At the same time, a tremendous wind with a human shadow swept through and cleared away the spot where they had been standing.

Bishop regretfully clenched the hand that had failed to grab Rian. It had been a hair's breadth difference.

"Damn...!"

Bishop spun his body 180 degrees and braked with both legs. Like sliding on ice, his body was pushed back more than ten meters.

A pile of dirt twenty times his body weight rose up behind his heels. It was a sight that showed just how much tremendous physical force his body contained.

Bishop looked back with mixed feelings at the path he had run. The ground was torn up and trees were broken haphazardly.

All of this was because of Rian. How dare he deceive his father.

"Imaginary Schema?"

He took out the report card with trembling hands. The more he thought about it, the more he could only sigh.

But on the other hand, he felt sorry for his inadequate son. Just how much had he trained to gain strength comparable to Schema?

'I suppose I can think of it as an effort award.'

Anyway, Shirone seemed to have already mastered spatial teleportation. Given that it was magic that even professionals found difficult, it was tremendous growth to achieve in just six months.

Shirone and Rian. Rian and Shirone. Bishop thought about the future of the two boys bound by a single fate.

Their talents and dispositions were vastly different, but wouldn't the number of steps they had taken be equal under the name of doing their best?

"This will be good memories too."

Bishop threw the report card over his shoulder and turned toward the mansion.

**Galliant Island(1)**

After leaping over the wall of the Ozent mansion, Shirone's group used all their strength to escape the noble district.

Thanks to casting spatial teleportation, they had escaped Bishop's predicted coordinates, but it wasn't a situation to feel relieved.

A Schema master's movement boasted an animal-like range of activity that couldn't be escaped with ordinary Teleportation.

Only after entering the commercial district did Shirone's group catch their breath. Bishop's face still vividly came to mind.

They had thought he surely wouldn't hurt his son, but the murderous intent in his approach as a whirlwind suggested he was capable of doing much worse.

Shirone sighed and said, "What do we do now? We've come this far, so we can't go back."

"It doesn't matter, does it? We got plenty of travel money. Let's rent a carriage and go to the port."

As long as his father wasn't around, Rian had nothing to fear. He'd get scolded eventually, but this wasn't the time to have gloomy thoughts before a fun trip.

They arrived at a stable on the outskirts of the city. While they sold horses to travelers, they also operated a transportation business where they hired drivers to take people to their destinations.

Since they had to match the ship's schedule and couldn't afford to waste time, Rian rented a four-person carriage that could depart immediately.

Rian and Tess sat side by side, while Shirone and Amy took the facing seats. Since it was seating for commoners, the interior was cramped and they had to sit close together.

The carriage departed in an awkward atmosphere, but the cool breeze coming through the windows quickly relieved the tension.

Tess cooled herself with a hand fan while looking at Shirone.

Though she had never learned magic, she knew how difficult it was to escape through a dense forest using Teleportation. As expected, he was a mage of considerable level.

However, if she just wanted to find someone good at magic, there were plenty among the nobles. The fact that it wasn't shocking enough for Rian to make a knight's oath meant her doubts still remained.

"Right. But what was that second magic? It felt strange for Teleportation."

"Ah, that was spatial teleportation. Since space curves along the time axis, you probably felt a little dizzy."

"What? That was spatial teleportation?"

Tess was shocked. Her friends also attended magic school, but not a single one had mastered spatial teleportation.

It wasn't magic that was possible just by knowing the theory. It was a matter of mental strength, an area that could only be conquered through time and effort.

"That's amazing. Did you get some kind of fortuitous encounter? Ah, I don't mean this in a dismissive way, but I know spatial teleportation as magic that only professionals use. Isn't it difficult without learning magic from childhood?"

Tess thought Shirone had entered the magic world through a fortuitous encounter in his childhood. Otherwise, there was no way for a commoner to learn magic.

Shirone nodded readily. It was half right and half wrong, but since it wasn't particularly important, he didn't feel the need to correct the misunderstanding.

"That's right. Without Rian, I wouldn't have been able to attend magic school. The Ozent family helped me get admitted to magic school."

"I thought so. Ah, but I still think that's amazing. Since you competed with nobles from childhood, you must have had a lot to worry about beyond just studying."

"Haha! It was like that at first. But it's okay now. Amy protected me a lot too."

"Hmph, what did I do? You didn't even tell me anything."

Amy snorted and turned her head away. Though she wasn't showing it, she was frustrated by Shirone's modest answer.

Tess didn't seem to think that Shirone, a mere commoner, had learned advanced magic through his own efforts.

Since they had never known each other, it was a natural reaction, but Amy didn't like how Tess was dismissing Shirone's arduous journey with the word "fortuitous encounter."

It was Rian who scratched Amy's itch.

"That's only from half a year ago though. Shirone has only been learning magic for six months."

"What, six months?"

Tess turned to look at Rian so sharply her neck might have snapped. This time, even her mind went blank.

There was no way to master spatial teleportation in just six months by any means. This was common knowledge spread throughout noble society, separate from a swordsman's way of thinking.

Tess slyly looked across at them. Shirone was smiling, but Amy was still pouting with her chin propped up, not even making eye contact.

Only then did Tess realize her mistake.

Since swordsmen and mages pursued different directions, their personalities were often opposite.

Where swordsmen spoke and listened as they felt, mages inferred countless meanings from the spaces between words. From Amy's perspective, it was quite likely that Tess's attitude seemed to belittle Shirone.

"Oh my, I'm sorry. I didn't know and just babbled all sorts of strange things. I didn't mean to make you feel bad. I would have been angry too if my boyfriend was treated like this."

Amy's face turned red. Mages were certainly the best at handling language. But that's exactly why they had no immunity to such direct apologies, like newborn babies.

"What, what did I? I didn't say anything. And he's not my boyfriend! We're just friends."

Though she answered gruffly, Amy's expression was much more relaxed than before.

"It's natural not to know about each other since we just met. Tess may be straightforward, but she has no ill intent, so please understand. If you have anything you want to say in the future, feel free to say it."

Rian spoke directly according to his nature. Instead, Shirone and Amy couldn't answer and fidgeted awkwardly.

For them, accustomed to weighing and measuring things, the swordsmen's frank conversational style was quite burdensome.
