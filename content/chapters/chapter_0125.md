Tess struggled to hold back her laughter as she watched the two who had suddenly become quiet. After seeing only tough and spirited colleagues at sword school, meeting magic school students made her feel like they were younger siblings despite being the same age.

"But Amy was impressive too. When did you learn Schema?"

"Before entering magic school, I trained for about two years."

"Oh, it's rare to learn Schema at a young age. There are many stories about how it's bad for growth, right?"

"I didn't really exercise. It just... happened somehow."

Just from those words, Tess understood. While many prodigies could emerge from the mental realm of Spirit Zone, Schema was a method that put the body through harsh training, making it difficult to learn at an immature age.

However, with the self-image memory of Insight, it would be possible to precisely control the body without going through difficult training processes.

"Ah, so Insight can be used that way too. That's really amazing."

"It's nothing that great. I don't even have a proper build, just slightly enhanced muscle strength. Compared to you, I'm at a child's level. I saw earlier how really fast you were. Once the acceleration kicked in, the gap would have widened so much that teleportation wouldn't even be possible."

"Come on, I'm a specialist, but you're a mage, right? Moreover, Rian still can't do Schema. Now I see why the Carmis family is famous on the continent."

Shirone looked back at Rian in surprise.

"Rian, you haven't learned Schema? Then what was that chopping firewood at our house? I didn't say anything because I thought it was Schema."

"Hohoho! Rian did that? To borrow Teacher Quan's words, it would be foolishly strong muscle power. Do you know how it was at sword school? In the final exam..."

"Ah, seriously! Why are you so interested in other people's private lives?"

Rian hastily cut off the conversation. He absolutely didn't want Shirone to know about it, regardless of anyone else.

But thanks to that, the atmosphere improved and the others also shared their school experiences. Even though their fields were different, they were all students, so the conversation continued endlessly.

That's how they were getting to know each other.

Shirone's group, having arrived at Creas Port, looked for passage to Galliant Island.

A large galleas moored at Dock 6 seemed to have finished preparations for departure and was unfurling its sails.

Since all the kingdom's schools had vacation around the same time, there were more tourists than usual. Carried along by the crowd onto the ship, Shirone secured a spot on the third deck.

Although passenger cabins were prepared on the lower floors, since this was their first time on a ship, it would be fun to travel while enjoying the scenery.

Waves lapped and wind carrying the salty scent blew in. Only after the port sank below the horizon did the group truly feel they were floating on the sea.

"How many hours will it take?"

"I heard it's about 5 hours by ship from Creas Port."

"I see. If we had been a little later, we might have had to leave tomorrow. There are more people going to the island than I thought."

As Shirone said, numerous people were coming and going on the deck. Half were merchants, but there were also tourists dressed as nobles. Moreover, quite a few people from places other than Creas could be seen.

"As Rian said, it must be a famous island. What kind of place is it?"

"I researched and brought information."

Amy pulled out her notebook as if she had been waiting. Tess, now friendly with everyone, spoke casually.

"Oh? As expected, very thorough personality."

"Right. I didn't even think to look it up."

When Shirone scratched his head sheepishly, Amy glared at him disapprovingly.

"You said you were going to explore ruins but didn't do any preliminary research?"

"Haha! Well, that's..."

There are two types of travelers in the world. Those who leave recklessly and those who research thoroughly before leaving.

The former could be said to pursue unknown romance, while the latter considers efficiency, and Amy belonged to the latter.

But Shirone couldn't belong to either. Since this was his first trip since birth, everything was fascinating and unfamiliar.

"First, let me tell you about Galliant Island where we're going. The site area is 1,500 square kilometers. It's a crescent-shaped island, and the north side has natural cliffs, so ships have to go around to the southern port. The western side has a mix of residential areas and resorts, and the Kergo Ruins are on the eastern side of the island. The Kergo Ruins site is a temple of the Kergo people who built a civilization 2,000 years ago."

"Kergo people?"

"Yes. Though they're now extinct, a small number of natives remain in the autonomous district at the center of the island. They're characterized by being dark-skinned and short in stature, with sunken eyes and small pupils. Oh, and they carve tattoos on their faces praising Ankera."

"What's Ankera?"

"It's the name of an ancient god the Kergo people believed in. And um... the natives chew a hard tree root called Loof, which seems to cause hallucinations. So they call Loof the divine awakening agent. They would commune with spirits while in a trance state. The cause of their downfall is known to be religious conflict, but some theories suggest that internal strife arose from overusing Loof."

"I see. That's interesting. An hallucinogen destroying a civilization."

"It would be because they abused it in the name of god. Right, I heard from my brother that most of the ruins site managers are Kergo people, so we'll be able to see them. But we won't be able to enter the native autonomous zone since outsiders aren't allowed. Oh, but my brother..."

"Hm? What did your brother say?"

Shirone asked curiously. The brother Amy mentioned would probably be Ares the explorer. Having traveled all over the world, there was a high probability he knew about the Kergo Ruins in detail.

"My brother said this: The downfall of civilization isn't determined by scholars. If you want to know about them, you'll have to offer something more important than the entrance fee."

Shirone nodded with a meaningful expression.

"Hmm, then does that mean there's something even more amazing in the autonomous zone than the Kergo Ruins?"

"I'm not sure. My brother is always like that. He thinks if he poses riddles, it makes him seem more mysterious."

"Haha! But I find this kind of thing more interesting. Something more important than the entrance fee. What could that be?"

Shirone's heart was pounding. From what Alpheas said and from Ares's words, he could tell that the Kergo Ruins weren't just a simple tourist site.

When Shirone couldn't contain his excitement like a child, Rian was also pleased in a different way. If his lord was full of motivation, the guardian knight's mission became even more important. Whatever secrets were hidden in the ruins site, he was determined to protect Shirone.

"Shirone, but when are you planning to go? You're not going right after we arrive, right?"

"Right. It's vacation first, so we should have fun."

"Then we need to secure lodging first. Let's move to the resort area once we get off at the port. There's a place where you can swim at the western beach. There's lots to see and many famous seafood restaurants."

Tess clenched her fists and trembled with excitement, wanting to see the southern country as soon as possible.

"Oooh, it'll be so fun!"

There were still over 4 hours left until arrival. But the thrill of travel quickly consumed time, and finally the island they wanted began to come into view.

"Wow! I can see it! It's Galliant Island!"

Passengers standing at the bow shouted, pointing at the distant island. As if responding to that sound, Shirone's group ran to the front of the deck.

The northern cliffs of Galliant Island greeted them. Vertical rock walls jutted up abruptly as if thick forests had been split with a sword.

Passengers shouted with excitement.

"We finally arrived! It's really magnificent, isn't it?"

"Wow! The water color is so beautiful! I want to swim quickly!"

But the merchants were still lying down on their cargo. They knew they still had to go around the island for another 30 minutes since the port was on the south side.

Galliant Port.

The port was crowded with people. Merchants getting off the ship and island merchants rushing to the ship were tangled together, causing a great commotion.

The tourists relatively had no choice but to disembark late, and Shirone's group also waited for the crowd to clear before stepping on land.

What they felt immediately upon disembarking was the warmth of the southern country. Creas had already entered early autumn weather, but Galliant Island was still summer.

After the merchants left, the port was filled with people engaged in other occupations. They were touts trying to attract tourists to their shops.

"Come, come! Come to the Dolphin Inn! You can enjoy a pleasant vacation at the cheapest lodging rates on the island! My wife's cooking is also outstanding!"

"Anyone who wants to try authentic southern seafood! Come to our restaurant! We also have carriages standing by for convenient transportation!"

"We'll carry your luggage! Many strong porters standing by!"

Shirone's group was overwhelmed by the voices of the touts.

No one had approached them directly yet, but they were definitely receiving attention. They first scored high points for not being adults. Moreover, their clothes and weapons were all high-quality, so it was natural for the touts to eye them.

Of course, not all of them were honest merchants. In an alley across from the dock, several groups making money through illegal means were searching for prey.

"Hehehe. Now, who shall we fleece today?"

A boy named Gis looked at the crowd with gleaming eyes. Behind him, two friends were surveying the same area.

What differentiated them from the outside touts was that they weren't shop owners. In the end, they could be called back-alley delinquents who made money with only their silver tongues.

Mainland delinquents and island delinquents differ from their very nature. In their lives floating in space on the vast ocean, they couldn't get even a bread crumb if they followed the rules set by the world.

Especially Gis had a strong rebellious streak since childhood and grew up receiving all kinds of abuse. It wasn't just once or twice that he got beaten by nobles for standing on his pride.

But such experiences were now just tools useful for making money.

"Wow, there are really a lot of people because it's vacation season. Gis, we can make a real score today, right?"

"Even so, half of them are broke. They just look flashy on the outside. We have to choose properly to succeed."

Gis carefully selected customers. But his friends, who had to earn a day's tribute money, were extremely impatient.

"Gis, choose quickly. Other people are going to snatch them all up."

"Got it. Wait and see."

Gis scanned the port with hawk eyes. But before he could survey everything, his gaze stopped at Dock 3.

Four people of similar age were having a conversation, and among them, the red-haired girl caught Gis's eye.

Her features contained in her small face were so distinct that even from this distance, he could feel she was pretty.

"Hey hey, that's it! Let's go with that group. Do you see them? Two guys, two girls."

"Really? There's also a big guy there, right? And he's even carrying a sword. Let's just choose someone else."

"These guys, really. Who am I? I'm Lord Gis, ruler of the port. Guys like that are cowards. Otherwise, why would they be crazy enough to come to a tourist spot carrying a sword?"

"Ugh, it's a bit dangerous. Don't tell me, Gis, you... aren't having another episode of that mental illness where you fall in love with a girl you've never seen before? What if they're mercenaries?"

"Hey! Can't you tell just by looking? They're students. Students can't lay a finger on us anyway. I'll go with a strong approach strategy, so support me well. Never bow and scrape just because they're nobles. We have to suppress guys like that from the start."

Gis led his two friends out of the alley. Even while heading to the dock, he was anxious that other touts might steal them, but as the girl's face gradually came into clear view, even such thoughts flew away.

'What's with this girl? She's really pretty...'

Feeling romantic emotions toward girls from other places was natural romance for island boys. But this was the first time he felt even noble feelings beyond love.

Gis hastily composed himself and approached. If he left things as they were, other touts would steal them away.
