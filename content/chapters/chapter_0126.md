"Hey there, welcome to Galliant! Here for vacation?"

Gis raised his hand with a friendly tone. The manual in this business was to never use honorifics with marks, no matter how noble they were.

In a sense, it was making money by risking your life, but even if trouble arose, all you had to do was hide for about a month and it would be over.

Those who came from across the sea to have fun rarely returned home and came back seeking revenge.

"Yes, I came to have fun with my friends."

Shirone smiled and responded warmly. Amy, on the other hand, openly scowled. Having ruled the back alleys in her youth and encountered the dark world, she knew exactly why these people were approaching them.

"You look like students. What school? Must be a prestigious one, right?"

"Alpheas Magic School."

"Aha! I know that place. It's close by, so quite a lot of students come here to have fun."

Amy groaned inwardly. Not only should they not have revealed they were students, but telling them their school was practically asking to be fleeced.

"But these folks here are pretty well-built for mages."

"What? We're from Kaizen Sword School! We're tall because we're swordsmen, you idiot!"

Just as Gis expected, Tess flared up. While she took pride in her physique, she had no desire to be lumped together with Rian and called "well-built."

"Haha! Sorry. I'm not good with words. I meant it as a compliment but I guess it came out wrong."

Gis thought this was the end of it. The reason life's bottom-feeders could act confident even in front of nobles was that they weren't bound by the rules society had set.

Nobles, on the other hand, had quite a lot of constraints on their position. Alpheas Magic School and Kaizen Sword School were famous for their strict discipline. If they caused trouble at a tourist spot, they couldn't avoid disciplinary action.

"Anyway, glad you came. I'm Gis, a local guide. If you hire me, I can handle everything from sightseeing to lodging and meals."

"We haven't finished discussing among ourselves yet. Let us think about it."

Shirone repeated what he had said to all the touts who had approached them so far.

But Gis's gang was different from the others. Having already caught their weakness, they persistently stuck to them trying to force the hire.

"Ah, what's with this attitude? You go to good schools so you must have plenty of money, right? We're really poor people, you know. You came here to spend money anyway, didn't you?"

Only then did Shirone realize they weren't just simple touts. Rian and Tess's eyes also turned cold, perhaps feeling the same way.

Gis's friends flinched and stepped back when they met the swordsmen's gazes. But Gis didn't even blink.

'Hehe, they can't do anything to us anyway.'

Having worked as a tout since he started maturing, he was well-informed about inland matters.

Alpheas Magic School strictly prohibited the use of magic outside school grounds. Since the magic school was like that, there was no need to even mention the sword school that emphasized chivalry.

Of course, he had been beaten up by hot-tempered students before, but wasn't that something you had to endure to make a living? Moreover, based on such experiences, Gis's tightrope-walking skills had already reached an expert level.

"Don't be like that and just trust me. I'll show you the most fun way to enjoy Galliant Island. Come on, let's go. What kind of man lacks decisiveness? Throw some money around in front of these lovely ladies. Huh? You'll come, right? Then I'll carry your bags?"

"Wait! Let us discuss this one last time."

"Phew, alright. But if you refuse after coming this far, that would really be bad."

Gis was already holding heavy bags in both hands.

Shirone looked around at his friends with a troubled expression. This was their first time in such a situation, and Gis's attitude was walking such a fine line that it was hard to be harsh with him, making it impossible to deal with him coldly.

"What should we do? Should we let him handle it?"

"It's because he knows our school name. Those guys know we can't act carelessly, so they're being so bold."

Hearing Amy's words, Tess was irritated. It was a despicable tactic, but it was certainly effective. Normally her fists would have been flying by now, but the fact that she was still holding back her anger was proof of that.

Rian, however, showed no particular interest. The only standard he had fixed in his mind was Shirone's safety.

"I don't really care. If Shirone wants to, I'll just follow along. If they insist even after he says no, I'll just beat them up."

For Rian, this trip wasn't just a simple vacation. It was his first time in foreign territory after taking the knight's oath with Shirone. Since they would encounter countless such situations someday, it was good to experience various scenarios in advance for the future.

"Ah~ my arms hurt. Can't you decide quickly? Even this is costing money, you know."

"That bastard really!"

Shirone stopped Tess as she tried to approach Gis. Since the school's honor was at stake, he wanted to avoid unnecessary violence.

"Alright. I'll hire you. How much is it?"

"Haha! Good thinking. Since it's you guys, I'll give you a special discount. Just give me 5 gold."

"What? 5 gold?"

Shirone's eyes went wide. 5 gold just to hire a guide? It was an outrageous rip-off. He didn't know the island's prices, but no matter how expensive, it shouldn't exceed 1 gold.

"Isn't that too expensive?"

"Hey, what are you talking about? For just 5 gold, I'll do everything without you lifting a finger. I'll rent you a carriage, arrange lodging and meals, show you around tourist spots. This is cheap for all that."

Amy was annoyed. She had stayed quiet not wanting to cause a commotion from the start, but now she could see they intended to strip them down to their underwear after catching one weakness.

Anyway, these guys wouldn't provide proper guide services. Moreover, even if they did, 5 gold was ten times the going rate.

'Sigh, I should have cut this short from the beginning.'

Amy regretted it, recalling old times. How could she have forgotten? This type had the habit of climbing higher if you didn't stomp them down hard.

"But even so, 5 gold is a bit..."

"This is a tourist spot. Of course it's more expensive than usual."

"Well, even so..."

"Forget it. Just pay them and let's go somewhere else."

Amy rummaged through her purse. Dragging such people around would only backfire. Once you gave in, they would definitely demand increasingly larger sums using the weakness as leverage.

"Here, 5 gold. Take it and get lost."

Amy scattered gold coins at Gis's feet. The brilliant golden coins bounced around on the ground.

"Wow! Gold coins! Real gold coins!"

Gis's friends scrambled to pick up the gold coins that had fallen to the ground. Gis, however, stood frozen like a statue.

If someone else had thrown money, he might have picked it up and run off just like his friends. But under her gaze that looked at him like a bug, he simply couldn't crawl around on the ground.

"...What are you doing right now? What are we, beggars?"

"Weren't you asking for it? We don't need a guide or anything, so just disappear from our sight."

"This is really! Are you done talking?"

"Excuse me, wait a moment. Let's not get excited first..."

Shirone tried to mediate with a troubled expression. While he was angry about being overcharged, he hadn't expected Amy to come out like this either.

"Shirone, forget it. Tell him to come at us. What can the likes of him do? These guys are just con artists. They'll use showing us around as an excuse to extort more money. They're irredeemable human trash."

Gis's friends winced. That was exactly the kind of business they ran.

Shirone frowned and turned away.

"Amy, stop it."

"Stop what? They think we're backing down because we're scared of them, right? I should show them a lesson here..."

"Even so, stop it."

Only then did Amy close her mouth. Since Shirone wasn't a noble either, he might have felt uncomfortable seeing the scene just now.

But if she didn't do this, those guys would stick to them like leeches and suck their blood until they dried up and died.

Gis gritted his teeth and held back his anger. His life had been sustained by pride alone. No matter how much nobles insulted him, his spirit had never been broken even once.

"G-Gis. Let's just go. We got the money."

"Hand it over."

"Huh? Hand what over?"

"Hand over the gold coins. Do you want to live receiving this kind of treatment? Don't you have any pride as a man of the island?"

Gis took the gold coins from his friends one by one. Indeed, just holding their solid weight was thrilling.

But he clenched his fist as if suppressing his desire. Then he looked back at Amy with cold eyes.

"Hmph, arrogant nobles. You throw around 5 gold so casually, I'm really envious. What does that feel like? I can't even imagine it."

Gis defiantly lifted his chin and scattered the gold coins in front of Amy's feet. The coins rolled around the area, emitting brilliant light.

"Aha? So this is how it feels? Fantastic. Guys, let's go."

Gis took his friends and disappeared into the alley.

Amy was astounded by their shamelessness. But the targets of conflict had already disappeared.

"Geez, letting those guys just... Shirone, why did you stop me? Guys like that need to be shown their place."

"I know. But if you really don't like it, you can just get angry or refuse. I don't think you needed to go that far."

"What do you mean? Are you saying I look down on people because I have money?"

"I don't think that. But that's what the situation turned into."

"Do you know what kind of guys those are and still say that? You've been through this when you were young too, haven't you?"

Shirone bit his lip. Maybe Amy was right. But no matter how trashy the other party was, he didn't want to see her act in ways that insulted another person's dignity.

"Forget it. Let's just go. Let's find a carriage first."

When Shirone remained silent, Amy turned around and walked away first. Watching her, Tess scratched her head awkwardly.

"Oh no. This turned into an awkward situation."

* * *

Entering the alley of Dock 3, Gis bickered with his friends. When ships came in, they needed to grab their share, but now all the customers had left, so all they could do was argue.

"Gis! How could you return that money! 5 gold is enough that we wouldn't have to pay tribute for several days."

"Don't you guys have any pride? When money is thrown in front of your face, should you take it like beggars?"

"So what if we do? Money is money anyway."

"I can't do that. Damn brat! Even if she looks down on me, there are limits!"

Gis trembled with clenched fists. But his friends couldn't understand him. What exactly was he so upset about?

Of course, the woman's action of throwing money around was a huge humiliation for them too, but the arrogant attitude of nobles wasn't something new.

"Gis, be honest. You've fallen for that girl, haven't you?"

"What? Why would I like that kind of brat?"

"You always act prideful in front of girls you like. But that girl is a noble. It's impossible anyway, and seeing how easily she threw out 5 gold, she must be really high in the noble hierarchy."

"So what? Just because she's a noble, does that make her everything? I'm Gis. I'm destined to become the ruler of the harbor!"

At that moment, footsteps echoed from a secluded part of the alley. At the distinctive sound of metal studs embedded in shoe soles hitting the ground, Gis's hair stood on end.

It was the same for his other friends. In the harbor, there was only one person who made such footsteps.

"Hey there, Gis."

It was a middle-aged man of medium height. With a rough face and viper-like sharp eyes. It was Falcoa, the action captain of the Freeman organization that Gis's gang belonged to.

Gis trembled. Falcoa was cruel. True to his nature of enjoying violence, he didn't mind taking hits either. When things went wrong, he would rush at 10 or even 100 people and beat up anyone he could catch. The nickname "Galliant's madman" wasn't given for nothing.

"Ah, Big Brother Falcoa. Hello."

Falcoa chewed rhythmically while putting his arm around Gis's shoulder. A disgusting smell pierced Gis's nose. Being a drug addict, he never took the loop out of his mouth.

"Hand it over. You got money, right?"

"Ah, well... no, we don't have any."

"Don't have any?"

A cold light flickered in Falcoa's eyes. Thinking this would lead to trouble, Gis's friends prostrated themselves on the ground.

"P-please spare us! Those kids said they wouldn't take our carriage! We stuck with them to the end but they threatened us..."

"Really? Then what was that thrown earlier? Was that not money but shit?"

Gis's heart sank with a thud. He had pretended not to know, but apparently he had been watching from beginning to end.

Was this how a frog felt when bitten by a viper's fangs? Fear made it hard to breathe.

"Hah, what should I do with you cute little things?"
