Shirone's group rented a carriage outside the port and headed to the western resort area. The beach with its expansive white sand was beautiful even from a distance. Countless shops lined the area, and accommodations were built along the mountainside like mountain village houses.

The place Rian had rented was a villa located halfway up the mountain. As befitting a building exclusively for nobility, it had sufficient space for the four of them to stay, and the view overlooking the ocean was satisfying.

Shirone admired the sea from the terrace. The blue ocean was rolling toward the white sand beach, creating foam.

Watching people leisurely enjoying the beach, he could momentarily forget the unpleasant quarrel that had occurred at the port.

Shirone's group organized their belongings and lit a fire in the fireplace. Then they gathered in the living room to briefly rest from their journey.

Having departed in the morning and eaten nothing but snacks until afternoon, they were hungry.

Tess, who had been pondering what food they should eat to create good rumors about their dining, clapped her palms together as if struck by a good idea.

"Ah-ha, why don't we just cook for ourselves?"

Rian looked back at her with a startled expression.

"What? You know how to cook too?"

"Hehe, of course. Did you think a swordsman couldn't cook?"

"I was wondering what you meant. If it's military-style combat rations, I'll pass."

"What do you take me for! I can cook properly!"

Only then did Rian show a surprised expression. He had never imagined that the tomboy-like girl would be confident about cooking.

But this was exactly the situation Tess had wanted. If she could imprint a different side of herself on Rian, this trip would be a great success.

"I'll make the most delicious food, so you just need to buy the ingredients. How about it?"

"Hmm, should we? Actually, it would be a bit awkward to go out and eat on the first day, right? What do you think, Shirone?"

"I'm fine with it too. Food cooked outdoors is always delicious."

Amy cautiously spoke up.

"Then... should I cook too?"

Everyone's attention focused on Amy. Of course, since she was different from Tess, it didn't seem unlikely that she could cook.

However, they hadn't expected that someone with her sharp personality would volunteer to personally prepare food for the men.

Tess grasped Amy's intentions with feminine intuition.

'More precisely, it's about Shirone, right? Hehe, despite how she looks, she has a really cute personality.'

Tess was strongly in favor. If this opportunity could help the two reconcile, it couldn't be better.

"Great. Let's have a cooking competition! Rian versus Shirone! You two will procure the ingredients while we prepare for cooking. How about it?"

Everyone's opinions matched, and Shirone and Rian headed to the market with the ingredient lists the girls had written.

Once the men disappeared, the atmosphere became much softer.

Standing side by side washing dishes, Tess looked back at Amy with mischievous eyes and asked.

"It's your first time, isn't it?"

"Huh? What are you talking about?"

"It's obvious just by looking. It's your first time fighting with Shirone, right? Even while arguing, your confusion was plain to see."

Amy hastily turned her gaze back to the dishes.

"We didn't fight, it's not our first fight, and it's definitely not a lovers' quarrel."

At the mage-like triple denial, Tess laughed heartily.

They say mages are cunning because their outside and inside are different, but in cases like this, it seemed more appropriate to call them cute.

"But you did carefully prepare the ingredient list, didn't you? Oh ho, now that I look at it, are you nervously watching for reactions?"

Amy stopped washing dishes and fell into thought. Since it was just between women, there was nothing she couldn't say. Eventually surrendering to Tess's interrogation, she opened up about her feelings.

"Shirone... sometimes feels faint."

"Oh ho, faint? That's quite poetic."

Amy chuckled, finding it strange even to herself.

"But it's true. Should I say he becomes transparent? As if he might disappear from before my eyes at any moment. It's probably because Shirone has a different perspective from other people."

"Different perspective? Don't tell me he has eyes in strange places?"

"That's possible too. Most people see the world from their own perspective. But some people expand their vision to include others' perspectives as well. Usually such people are called persons of character."

"Hmm, by that logic, I'm definitely not a person of character. I can never figure out what other people are thinking."

"Same here. But Shirone is different. He's kind and considerate, but I think the biggest factor is his different perspective from others."

Tess smiled knowingly.

"Ah-ha! So the point is that he defended those punks and didn't take Amy's side. Right? Am I right?"

Amy scratched her cheek awkwardly.

"Well, that's... But if he were just a goody-two-shoes, I would have just thought that and let it go. But Shirone is different. In some sense, he has a different perspective even from persons of character."

"Different perspective? What other kind of perspective could there be?"

Amy raised her index finger toward the ceiling.

"An omniscient viewpoint, perhaps?"

"Omniscient...?"

"Yes. When Shirone starts viewing the world from an omniscient perspective, he becomes faint. He becomes different from us and different from any human. That's probably because he has an extremely elevated viewpoint where even his own existence appears as nothing but a dot."

Amy still remembered it vividly. The moment when Shirone opened his Immortal Function without hesitation to save all the students.

How could he do such a thing? It was on a different dimension from suicide. Sacrificing one's life for others was thousands of times harder than choosing death because of one's own pain.

"When Shirone becomes transparent... the boundary between himself and others crumbles. Even he becomes nothing more than one human being equal to everyone else. From that viewpoint looking down at the world, what do you think governs Shirone? I think it's balance. If one side of the scale tips even slightly, Shirone could step onto the opposite side without hesitation. Even if that scale means death."

"Oh, that's impossible. Where would such a person exist? That would literally be a saint!"

"But it's true. Because I'm someone who benefited from that balance. No, all the students at the magic school had their lives saved by Shirone."

Tess couldn't close her gaping mouth. One student saved the lives of all the students? Just how much more would she need to be surprised before she could say she knew Shirone?

A lonely emotion flashed across Amy's face.

"I just had this thought. When Shirone stopped me, maybe I too was nothing more than a small dot viewed from that high place. Shirone is different from me. No, he's different from anyone. That's why he's outstanding as a mage, but sometimes it's also disappointing."

Tess gently shook Amy's shoulder.

"Amy, don't think like that. Shirone truly cares about you. That's why he asked you even knowing it was a couple's trip. You're different from the common people wandering the streets. You'll always be Carmis Amy."

Amy smiled at Tess's heartfelt encouragement. But that didn't change her thoughts.

To Shirone, who could coldly cast aside even his own life, how much value could the existence of others really hold?

"Amy, why don't you just tell Shirone? Ask him why he didn't take your side. Tell him you're so disappointed and frustrated that you can't sleep. If you talk like that, it'll work out, right?"

Amy chuckled and shook her head.

"Shirone knows too. The reason he didn't refute my words is because he understood. Don't worry too much. It'll be resolved soon. It's just awkward because it's our first time, like you said."

Tess, with her straightforward personality, felt frustrated. Once feelings were hurt, shouldn't they call the person involved and settle it once and for all?

Yet Amy concluded by saying there was nothing to discuss because they both understood everything.

"Phew, I really can't understand how mages think."

* * *

Shirone and Rian arrived at the general store alley. Since the ingredient lists written on their respective papers were different, if they tried to visit all the shops extending like a maze, they might miss dinner time.

Shirone thought it would be better to move separately.

"Let's split up here. After buying things, we can return to the villa."

"Should we? But can you carry everything alone? It'll be heavy."

Shirone looked at Rian with an incredulous expression. No matter how weak he was, couldn't he carry garlic, onions, and pepper? Though he had made a knight's oath, worrying about shopping bags was unnecessary.

"Forget it! I'll handle my own shopping, so don't get lost yourself. You know it's a cooking competition, right? The loser does the dishes."

"Fine! I'll make sure you and Amy wash dishes together harmoniously. You'd better hope to lose if you want to reconcile with Amy."

"Reconcile what? We weren't even fighting."

"Huh? Didn't you fight at the port? That's why you're both being awkward with each other now."

"Amy isn't that petty. There was just a slight difference of opinion. It's something that can happen anytime when exchanging viewpoints."

"Haha! You fool, that's called fighting."

Shirone swallowed his words. Just like before, it was the same now. When Rian called him a fool, he strangely felt self-loathing.

"Anyway, forget it. I'll start by buying vegetables, so see you at the villa."

"Then I should start with meat. I'm going first!"

Shirone stared blankly at Rian charging toward the butcher shop. Just watching him run, he couldn't imagine how much meat he would buy.

Shirone checked the note Amy had written. He didn't know what dish it was, but there weren't any particularly hard-to-find ingredients.

However, since there were more types of ingredients than Rian's list, he needed to diligently make his rounds to make it on time.

Shirone spent about 30 minutes walking around buying most of the ingredients. At the same time, he did some sightseeing, and perhaps because it was a resort area, the shops were exotic and had many interesting things.

Stalls with games for merchandise were popular, and various performances and street parades could be seen quite often.

For a single commercial district to focus this much on entertainment, a tremendous number of tourists had to constantly flow in.

Indeed, the streets overflowed with people, and free laughter that couldn't be felt on the continent decorated the southern sky.

'Wow, there are many interesting shops. I should play here tomorrow.'

Having finished shopping, Shirone turned his steps toward the villa.

At that moment, a door burst open from a shop in front of him, and a woman tumbled to the ground as if pushed.

"Kyaa!"

"Kyaa?"

Shirone's head tilted at the strange scream. But he quickly came to his senses and approached.

It was a woman in her mid-twenties. She had short hair with straight-cut bangs following her eyebrows, but thanks to her pretty face, she didn't look ridiculous.

"Why, why are you doing this? What did I do wrong?"

The woman who got up covered her chest area with both arms. She wore a dress with a low neckline like a bar woman.

Her eyebrows were thin and her eyes sharp, but facing the large man, her expression looked as gentle as a herbivore.

"Kukuku, why are you being like this? I'm just asking you to play with me."

"I'm not that kind of woman!"

"Not what? If you're walking around a tourist area dressed like that, it goes without saying. Stop that and play with me."

The man intimidating the woman was Gamos, famous as a wealthy person on Galliant Island.

He was enormously large, but far from muscular, made up of fat, with particularly severe abdominal obesity.

However, the power of money seemed fearsome, as he was accompanied by bodyguards with impressive builds on both sides.

"Come along while I'm asking nicely. Honestly, you're not in a position to be picky, are you?"

"Save me! Save me!"

Even as Gamos grabbed the woman's wrist and dragged her away, no one intervened.

Tourists didn't want to get involved in dangerous situations in foreign places. Also, locals feared Gamos's influence.
