"Hey! Stop it!"

Shirone stepped forward and shouted.

Gamos turned to look at Shirone with a bewildered expression. He wondered what kind of fool was butting in, only to see a boy who wasn't even twenty yet, holding shopping baskets in both hands.

"What the hell are you? Where does some little brat get off interfering?"

"Let that woman go. Everyone's watching, and the guards will be here soon."

"Bahahaha! Guards? Do you have any idea who I am?"

"What difference does it make who you are? If you keep this up, I'll go get the guards myself."

"Hmm..."

As Gamos loosened his grip, the woman quickly escaped and hid behind Shirone. He was just a boy, but among all the countless people in the crowd, he was the only one she could rely on.

"Please save me. That man is going to..."

Gamos frowned and approached.

"What a bothersome little pest. Hey kid, I'm a merchant here on Galliant Island. That woman stole my goods. High-quality ceramics, no less, and she broke them while trying to steal them."

"What? Ceramics?"

Shirone blinked. If the man's words were true, then the woman standing behind him had committed theft.

So he was trying to receive compensation with her body because she had stolen goods. While one could judge who was right or wrong, it was an awkward situation to take anyone's side.

"That's right. Of course I demanded her body as collateral. But since she damaged the goods, shouldn't she compensate me somehow? Even if you call the guards, she's the one who'll get arrested."

When Shirone turned around, the woman whose eyes met his quickly looked away.

"Is what he's saying true?"

"Yes, I'm sorry. But I really needed that ceramic. I really did."

"Hahaha! There's no situation in this world where ceramics are absolutely necessary. What you need is money. I was just going to let her earn some money. Now you understand, don't you, kid? It's best not to get involved with women like that. Of course, if you're looking for a one-night companion, she'd be perfect. Isn't that right, everyone?"

The onlookers burst into laughter following Gamos. It wasn't really a laughing matter, but the tension that had been building from various factors was released all at once.

"Looks like you came to have fun with friends, so go eat some good food. If you carelessly interfere in adult matters, this is what happens."

The woman shook Shirone's arm and pleaded.

"Please don't go. If you leave, I don't know what that man will do."

"How about turning yourself in instead? If you tell the guards, it'll be resolved."

"Absolutely not. That man has this island in his grip. Please believe me."

"How much do the ceramics cost?"

"I don't know the exact price, but probably around 50 silver."

Shirone fell into thought. Paying 50 silver for the woman wouldn't be difficult. But would compensating her just because he had money really be the right thing to do? Just as he had no right to judge someone's crime, he thought he had no right to pardon someone's crime either.

Shirone made his decision and approached Gamos.

"I'll compensate for the ceramic cost instead. So please let the woman go."

Gamos narrowed his eyes as if surprised. Of course, 50 silver wasn't a large sum for nobility. But what were his true intentions in protecting the woman while opposing him, someone with tremendous influence on Galliant?

"Oh ho, now I see you're planning to claim her for yourself? Well, where else would a greenhorn like you get such a beauty for 50 silver?"

Shirone's brow furrowed. He felt unpleasant being treated as a lecher by Gamos, who saw only what he wanted to see.

"I have no such thoughts. Do you think everyone is like you?"

"Then why are you interfering? That woman committed theft. Just hand her over to the guards and be done with it."

"Whatever this woman did isn't for me to judge. The reason I'm using 50 silver despite that is because I think she shouldn't pay a price greater than her crime. If you have any intention of doing something more to this woman, please take this money and end it."

The woman's eyes lit up as if she had realized something after hearing Shirone's words. Gamos, on the other hand, snorted derisively. What complicated thoughts could there be over just 50 silver?

"Here, 50 silver. Now please forgive the woman."

Gamos stared intently at the silver coins on Shirone's palm.

Honestly, he couldn't feel good about this. The woman was too precious to let go, and he didn't like Shirone's attitude either.

To him, it looked like some naive kid had lost his head over a beauty.

"Compensation isn't necessary. I have more money than I know what to do with anyway. But there's one condition."

"A condition? What is it?"

"I understand you're a fine man sacrificing yourself for a woman. Then you should be able to apologize to me on that woman's behalf, right? Bow your head to me in front of everyone."

The onlookers' attention focused on Shirone. Enduring humiliation for another person wasn't common, but Shirone stepped forward readily.

"Alright. If that will make you forgive her, I'll apologize."

"Don't just say it, bow your head. Offer a very polite apology."

Shirone bowed deeply at the waist.

"I apologize on behalf of this woman for stealing the ceramics. Please forgive her."

"Hmm."

The man looked down at Shirone arrogantly. Then he burst into a sneer, took a step forward, and swung an uppercut.

Shirone saw the fist rising before his eyes and instinctively stepped back. The large man's knuckles whooshed through the air past his nose.

"Wh-what are you doing?"

Gamos clicked his tongue as if he had expected this and pointed at Shirone.

"Look. You dodged, didn't you? You didn't sincerely apologize to me. If you had taken that punch, you might have been able to save that woman. But you dodged. Because you were afraid of getting hit. Now you understand? The world isn't that easy. Try to refute me if you can. You're just pretending to be good."

People agreed with Gamos's words. If he really intended to save the woman, he could have closed his eyes tight and taken the beating. But Shirone had dodged. In the end, it meant he was being hypocritical.

Voices of contempt flew from here and there.

"I figured as much. He put on all kinds of airs, but now he shows his true colors. I thought some great saint had appeared or something."

"Kids these days are way too cocky. He probably thinks he looks really cool doing that."

Shirone couldn't understand people's reactions.

"What's wrong with me dodging?"

"And you still don't know shame! Even the people watching here are all disappointed in you. You acted like some great apostle of justice, but it was all fake!"

Shirone's face turned bewildered.

"What on earth are you talking about? Even if it's fake, doing good deeds is much better than doing bad things like you, isn't it?"

"What? That's..."

Gamos was struck speechless. The people who had been pouring out mocking words couldn't hide their confusion either.

The woman who had stepped back to observe the situation came to a near-certain conclusion.

'My guess was right. This boy... is a mage.'

Mages don't ask "Who is right?" What they ask is "What is right?"

This boy doesn't rationalize himself. The way of acknowledging facts and inferring the correct answer was a thought system commonly seen in mages.

The woman sneered at the people who had been struck speechless.

'Hmph, you never thought to help anyone, but you're eager to tear down others' good deeds. That's why you amount to nothing.'

In any case, it was time to move now. It would be best to escape while people's attention was focused on Shirone and Gamos.

Moving slowly along the wall, the woman quickly turned a corner at a certain point and disappeared.

Meanwhile, Gamos's face was flushed. The boy who had made him feel unpleasant at every turn from his appearance until now was mocking even his worldview.

And in front of so many people.

"Kid, it seems you've messed with the wrong person."

Gamos's voice dropped heavily. It was his original voice, having shed the merchant's mask. The sharp-witted bodyguards drew the real swords at their waists.

Killing intent is merely a concept, but it has the power to affect reality. Just having sharp, honed longswords in the space makes humans imagine death.

"What are you looking at? Go beat him up thoroughly!"

At Gamos's command, the bodyguards rushed in from both sides. They wouldn't kill carelessly, but they were ready to cut if necessary.

At that moment, dust flew into a bodyguard's eyes with a puff. Then another stone flew and struck another bodyguard's forehead hard.

Shirone looked toward where the stones had come from. At the entrance to an alley, the woman from before stood holding an armful of stones.

She pelted them with stones in succession. When the bodyguards hesitated and stepped back, she grabbed Shirone's wrist and ran down the alley.

"Let's run! Follow me this way!"

"Huh? Wait..."

Shirone had known early on that the woman had left her spot.

He had pretended not to know because he thought it was fortunate.

From talking directly with Gamos, he was someone who would make the woman pay a much harsher price than her crime deserved.

"But why did you come back?"

"Hurry! If you get tangled up with those guys, it'll be troublesome!"

The two ran down the maze-like alleys. Thanks to the woman knowing the complex paths, they quickly disappeared from the bodyguards' sight.

Gamos's voice carried over from the market.

"Chase them all down and catch them! I'll kill them all!"

* * *

The warehouse was hot with the heat of violence. Falcoa's kicks mercilessly drove into the side of Gis, who was curled up on the floor.

Each hit felt like his heart stopped. He was so terrified he couldn't remember where he'd been hit. Only stimulus and non-stimulus were all he could feel.

"Vermin bastard. Feels good getting beaten, doesn't it? Huh? It must feel good. So get beaten more."

Gis's friends were on their knees in the corner of the warehouse.

Their eyes were swollen from crying, but the tears showed no sign of stopping.

"Please forgive us! We'll go out and earn money! He's really going to die at this rate!"

"Oh really? Then do you want to get beaten from now on?"

The friends' bodies stiffened. Falcoa's face, glaring with mismatched eyes, looked like a demon.

If he wanted to, he could easily kill Gis. But Falcoa deliberately didn't hit his face. That fact was even more frightening.

Falcoa grabbed Gis's hair and lifted him up forcefully. Even in his weakened state, Gis stood up abruptly.

Though he hadn't been hit in the head, his pupils were unfocused. It felt like his brain was paralyzed from mental shock alone.

"D-does it hurt? Does it hurt? Tell me. Does it hurt? Does it hurt?"

Falcoa repeatedly slapped Gis's cheeks. Even though they weren't particularly forceful attacks, Gis convulsed each time he was hit.

His friends burst into tears again at the sight.

'Ugh, that crazy bastard. He's really going to kill someone at this rate.'

Falcoa slammed Gis to the ground. There wasn't any particular reason.

If he had to give one, it would be because he could feel the effects of the loop he'd taken wearing off.

"You returned 5 gold because your pride was hurt? How admirable. Really admirable, Gis."

"I'm sorry! I won't do it again!"

Gis felt wronged. He wanted to fight. But he was too scared. In the face of Falcoa's madness, pride was useless. If he could just get out of here, it seemed like he could do anything.
