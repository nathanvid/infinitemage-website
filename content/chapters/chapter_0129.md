"I lost 5 gold. Taking back what you've already given is the worst thing in the world. That woman needs to pay damages."

Falcoa lifted Gis's face up. With his chin raised until his back was about to break, Gis couldn't even breathe. If he bent it back just a little more, his spine might snap.

"Does it hurt? It should hurt. I'm incredibly strong, you know."

"Please... spare me."

"Should I make it so it doesn't hurt? Chew on this. Then it won't hurt at all."

Despite his difficult situation, Gis turned his gaze. Falcoa was holding a tree root in his hand.

Having been born and raised on the island, he knew what it was. It was loop, the natives' stimulant. As a drug used for possession rituals, its addictiveness was incomparable to other narcotics. Wasn't there even a theory that the Kergo people perished from overuse of loop?

"Please, I beg you. Anything but that..."

Gis pleaded desperately. Once addicted to loop, his life would be over.

He would drift through a gutter life, and his only family, his younger sister, would inevitably be driven onto the streets.

Falcoa, as if he had expected this, put the loop he had offered to Gis into his own mouth.

What was this about addiction? If he couldn't live without loop, he could just use it for the rest of his life.

"What a coward. This is God's stimulant. Anyway, what are you going to do now? Will you bring her?"

"What? Bring who?"

"That red-haired girl. She looked fresh. I could probably sell her for a good price, hehe. Of course, I'd have to put her out as used goods."

Gis was horrified. Human trafficking a noble, of all people. But given Falcoa's mental state, addicted to loop, he was more than capable of such things.

'He's insane. He's not in his right mind.'

Falcoa was an action leader of the Freeman organization. He was also the highest-ranking person that Gis, a mere underling, could make contact with.

Though he had never seen Freeman, the leader, directly, among the principles he had laid down was a clause prohibiting human trafficking.

"B-but if we do such a thing, we'll be expelled from the organization. The code of conduct... Ugh!"

A studded boot spun Gis's jaw. His mind went blank and he couldn't think of anything.

Falcoa grabbed Gis's head and lifted it up. The moment he heard the cold voice, Gis's focus returned.

"Or what will you do? Will you bring your sister instead?"

"Th-that's..."

Gis's body trembled violently. Anger and fear mixed together, creating an emotion whose taste he couldn't fathom.

His sister was precious beyond anything he could trade for. He didn't want to show her this dirty world, at least not to her.

"Oh, didn't I mention? Actually, I like your sister. How about introducing me to her on this occasion?"

A rotten smell came from Falcoa's mouth as he chewed the loop.

Shirone and the woman succeeded in shaking off Gamos's bodyguards after running through alleys for 30 minutes.

True to their training, they were fast, but using blind spots for psychological warfare and leading them in circles had been effective.

The two leaned against a wall for a while, catching their breath. They had run so much that they could taste blood in their mouths and their legs were shaking.

The woman looked at the panting Shirone and let out a laugh.

"Hehe, you have surprisingly good stamina? You look so delicate that I thought you'd give up running."

"If I gave up, I'd get caught. I'm dying from exhaustion. But, um... are you okay?"

"I'm Marsha. I'm used to running away, so this much is nothing. Let's go inside somewhere and rest. I'm thirsty, so I need to drink some beer. I'll buy you a drink as thanks."

Shirone was puzzled. Despite being chased, Marsha showed no signs of tension.

Moreover, suggesting they drink beer meant she had money, so why had she stolen in the first place?

"Ah, I think I should get going."

"You can't wander around right now anyway. Let's wait at a shop I know. Gamos is violent but stupid, so he forgets quickly. If we hold out for just an hour, he'll get distracted by partying and won't even pursue us. And more than anything, I'm scared. Could you stay by my side for just a little while?"

Marsha stuck out her tongue and winked. Though he wasn't charmed by her cute appearance, Shirone ultimately decided to follow her words. Most importantly, if Gamos caught him now, things would become irreversibly serious.

"Alright. But I have companions waiting, so I probably can't stay long."

"Okay. Let's just wait until Gamos's men give up. This way."

Marsha led Shirone through winding alleys to a secluded tavern. He wondered who would come to such a place to drink, but it was surprisingly bustling with people.

"Hmm, this place hasn't changed even after all these years."

"Wasn't this a place you used to frequent? You said earlier that you knew this tavern..."

"Ah, I used to come here often before. This is my first time back to Galliant Island in three years. I have a friend living here."

"I see. You knew the way so well that I thought you were a local."

"Hehe, once I see a path, I never forget it. Running away is part of my life."

When Marsha sat at the bar with Shirone, rough-looking men all turned to look at once. The combination of a beautiful woman and a young boy seemed out of place.

"People are staring at us."

"Don't mind them. This is a tavern that only the island's troublemakers come to. When incidents happen, information comes here first, so we can also find out when Gamos gives up."

"Then isn't it more dangerous? His men could storm in here."

"Gamos is someone who rules the island, not a troublemaker. So this place is... like a kind of resistance. A community of shared destiny, you could say?"

Shirone didn't believe it completely. With so many people coming and going, it would be virtually impossible to control information perfectly.

'This can't be done with just a system. If it's possible, it would be through agreements or regulations. But why? There's nothing they could gain.'

When Shirone stared intently, Marsha smiled awkwardly.

"Geez, I really can't fool you. Yes, you're right. This tavern is in cahoots with the Galliant autonomous government. What happens here is overlooked, even by officials."

"I thought so. But why would the government do such a thing?"

"Money. Money laundering, slush fund creation, lobby fund circulation, and so on. This is what they call Island Gate. You could say it's a system created by the closed nature of the island? There was an agreement. In exchange for circulating funds in the shadows, they guarantee the safety of criminals. Mutual benefit. Well, isn't that how the world works? Hihi!"

Marsha flicked the twig in her mouth. Her gull-like smile somehow looked sad.

"It's funny when you think about it. People talk big about punishing criminals, but in the end, it's criminals who fill their bellies. They break down money that's too big to swallow into small pieces to make it easier to digest. Like microorganisms of society? Without microorganisms, living things die."

Shirone couldn't answer. Social systems that went against human nature were too complex and varied for an 18-year-old boy to judge.

"I've only talked about serious things. You said your name was Shirone? What brought you to the island?"

"I came to have fun with friends. We wanted to go swimming and see the ruins."

"The Kergo Ruins? I've been there before. Ah, I was young then, but I'm already twenty-seven. I might die an old maid at this rate. How old are you?"

"Eighteen."

"Oh my, older than I thought? You really look young for your age."

"You look young for your age too, sister. Ah, is it okay to call you sister?"

"Of course. Everything starts with sister. Later, if we become lovers, you can call me anything, hohoho!"

Shirone raised the corners of his mouth as if absurd. For an 18-year-old boy, a 27-year-old woman was an adult beyond his reach.

But aside from that, Marsha was a much more intelligent and rational woman than he had expected.

The conversation was enjoyable, and with his guard down, Shirone confided about what he had experienced at the port.

Marsha nodded as if she had some idea and said, "Ah, you got caught by a street tout. They're really nasty. But 5 gold was a bit much."

"Yes. In the end, it led to a conflict of opinions with my friend, so I'm not in a good mood. He's probably waiting for me now. I'll get scolded when I go back."

Marsha checked the time and asked the bartender, "How's the Gamos situation?"

When the bartender just wiped glasses as if he hadn't heard, Marsha placed a silver coin.

Then, as if nothing had happened, the bartender's mouth opened.

"According to news that came in 10 minutes ago, they've spread out centered on the main road. About 40 people are probably blocking all the passages."

"Ugh, still? That guy is really persistent."

"Usually Gamos alerts are turned off quickly. He must have really blown his top today."

Marsha turned to Shirone and grinned sheepishly. Shirone had nothing to say either. He was the very person who had blown Gamos's top off.

Marsha returned to the original topic.

"Anyway, it's best to deal with street touts appropriately and avoid them. They belong to organizations in their own way. Once you get entangled, it becomes hard to handle the aftermath."

"I see. Actually, I didn't think that far."

"Hehe, do you need to know? You're just here to have fun, right? But there's always danger lurking in tourists' enjoyment. Islands are small and closed. To share limited resources, you have to compete more fiercely than on the mainland."

Shirone engraved it in his mind. Since he was planning to stay on the island for ten days, he would encounter numerous touts.

If it weren't for Marsha's advice, he might have faced them as he did today without knowing anything, and it could have escalated into a major incident.

Shirone suddenly realized and looked at Marsha.

From what he had observed during their conversation, she was truly a good person. She was kind, witty, and had the prudence not to judge others' words hastily.

Why would such a person pickpocket? Seeing how she readily threw a tip to the bartender, she didn't seem short of money either.

"Um, I'm not sure if I should ask this, but I'm too curious."

Marsha leaned back in her chair and looked up at the ceiling.

"Whew, I was nervous about when you'd ask. But Shirone. A woman's three sizes aren't meant to be heard, but imagined in your head."

"No! That's not it! Why did you steal the pottery?"

"Huh?"

"You don't seem like someone who would pickpocket. And you were lying about not having money. It wasn't even a particularly useful item, so why did you steal the pottery..."

"Hmm."

Marsha rested her chin on her hand and fell into thought.

"I don't know. Should I say I just felt like stealing it?"

"What? Is that possible?"

"It is possible. It's called kleptomania. Of course, it wasn't like that from the beginning. I was an orphan. My parents abandoned me when I was four. A mercenary man picked me up and raised me, and he became my adoptive father."

At the unexpected words, Shirone's heart trembled. Marsha was also someone who had been abandoned by her birth parents, just like him.

"But it was far from a comfortable life. Mercenary groups are full of strange people. When I was eleven, a guy famous for being violent in the mercenary group tried to lay his hands on me. Fortunately, my adoptive father found out first and beat him up."

"Of course. When his daughter almost went through such a thing. Anyone would do that."

"Hehe, would they really?"

"What?"

Marsha looked down at the bar with sad eyes. Somehow, her eyes seemed to have become moist.

"I received one piece of bread and one cup of water every day. My adoptive father gave me nothing else. No clothes, no sweets, no toys. In the end, he was breeding me. That's when I started stealing other people's things. One day I was caught stealing an apple, and he meekly paid compensation. But as soon as we got home, he changed and started hitting me. Without saying a word, until I passed out."

"That's too much. If he had the ability to pay compensation, couldn't he have just bought it for you in the first place? And why didn't you ask him to buy it for you, sister?"

"Because that's what my adoptive father wanted. Submission to him. The only resistance I could manage was stealing things every day. Of course, on the days I got caught, I was beaten to death. It was a terrible daily life. Then one day, I ended up giving up on everything. So I said this to my adoptive father."

Marsha cupped her chin as if recalling that time.

"You can kill me if you want."
