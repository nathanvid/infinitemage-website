Shirone's chest felt heavy. How much abuse must she have endured for such words to come from a child's mouth?

"From that day on, those words became a kind of spell. Every time my foster father would beat me, I'd say this: You can kill me if you want. Then he'd stop hitting me with an angry expression and leave. Heh, I just lived like that. When I was twelve, when I was thirteen, all the way until I left home at seventeen."

"That's about the same age as me now."

"Right, old enough to open your eyes to the world. Then one day I finally realized the meaning behind all the things my foster father had done to me. Or maybe I already knew. That's probably why I never asked for anything."

Shirone could now guess what had happened. Marsha's foster father had entertained terrible thoughts that should never be entertained.

"How foolish. If he wanted to do it, he should have just gone ahead and done it cleanly. Then we wouldn't have been messily entangled for seventeen years. In the end, he was just a pathetic coward who couldn't do this or that. From that point on, I started carrying a knife hidden in my clothes. One day I looked into my foster father's eyes as he was beating me. Ugh, he looked so pitiful I couldn't bear to watch. So I just said it."

Marsha spoke calmly with restrained emotion.

"You can embrace me if you want."

"...Did your foster father do that?"

"Heh, strangely enough, there's no plot twist in stories like this. That man pounced on me as if he'd been waiting for it, and I stabbed him in the throat with my knife. Honestly, I didn't feel anything at all. Then I left home and wandered around the world here and there until I drifted to this place."

Shirone felt a heaviness in his chest. Hearing such a story directly from the person involved, rather than just through books or rumors, filled him with an inexplicable sense of indignation.

"Um, I don't know what to say..."

"It's okay! I'm managing to make a living now. My foster father died, but the kleptomania doesn't go away easily. I've had trouble because of this more than once or twice. Ugh."

When Marsha laughed brightly, Shirone's mood improved as well. He thought she was amazing for being able to consider others despite having gone through such experiences.

"I think embracing unforgettable pain is also one way to deal with it. You're doing your best to overcome the pain, aren't you? Your kleptomania will disappear soon too."

"Thank you for understanding. If you had any ideas about doing something to me tonight, it would have worked perfectly."

"No! I really...!"

"I know. Don't blush for no reason. Having a little brother like you around wouldn't be boring."

"I feel the same way. Actually, I was thinking that Marsha really feels like a real older sister."

"Hehe! Yeah, thanks."

Shirone was sincere. When he had seen Rian and Reina together before, he had thought it would be nice to have siblings.

If he had an older sister, would it feel like this? Her way of speaking and every action made Shirone's heart feel at ease.

Meanwhile, the bartender who had gone into the room came out.

Though he didn't know the detailed structure, it seemed like all kinds of information were being collected in the room he had emerged from.

"Gamos alert lifted. He found a woman he likes and is returning to the mansion to throw a party."

"Whew, at least it's not too late."

Marsha glanced at Shirone with a sly look.

"Hmph, were you that eager to get away from me? Just a moment ago you were saying in a childish voice, 'Marsha, please become my real sister.'"

"...I didn't say it like that."

Shirone felt the same regret. For him, who wasn't used to women, this was the first time he had conversed losing track of time.

But for the sake of the villa residents who were waiting with empty stomachs, he had to leave now.

"I think I should go back. Can I see you again?"

"Of course. It's not like I can run away in the middle of the ocean, right? Come visit when you're bored. I'm planning to stay here."

"Haha! Okay, then I'll be going."

As Shirone hurriedly left the bar, Marsha ordered strong liquor with a relieved expression.

As expected, two men who had been looking for an opportunity approached as if they had been waiting.

"Looking good there. I guess I'm so intoxicated by you that the drinks cost more than usual."

"Getting a room? This place is dangerous for a woman alone - you never know what might happen. How about it, shall we go in together?"

Marsha didn't even turn her head.

"Get lost. Before I kill you."

"What? Did you just finish talking? Want to get properly dealt with today?"

The man grabbed the bottle on the table upside down. People looked toward the bar at the tense atmosphere.

When attention focused on them, Marsha let out an inaudible sigh. Then she suddenly changed her attitude and let out a seductive laugh.

"Hohoho! Fine, let's go to a room. But can just two of you handle it? If you have friends, why don't you bring more?"

"Wh-what?"

"Bring them. Ten people? No, twenty is fine too. I'll play with you all night long, so bring them. I hate it most when things get interrupted halfway through."

The men became unpleasant without even knowing why. But Marsha knew. When reproductive competition intensifies, males reveal their inherent weakness.

"What the hell. She must be crazy. Let's go."

"Ugh, what bad luck."

Marsha looked at the departing men as if they were pathetic, then turned around.

The drink she had ordered was already there. When she downed it in one gulp, fire shot up from her throat and her mind became hot.

"Phew, this is how liquor should be. Bartender, one more."

Instead of setting out a new glass, the bartender came over directly and poured into Marsha's glass.

"...Are you that Marsha?"

"Hehe, is there another Marsha?"

"I heard the Magic Association is searching for you, but you've done well avoiding them until now. Did you finally come in?"

"No. I'll leave soon. I just came briefly to settle things."

"I'd appreciate it if you could proceed quietly. If someone of your caliber causes a disturbance, the island becomes chaotic. We don't want the agreement to be broken. If you promise to cooperate, we'll let you stay here for a while."

"Forget it. I never planned to stay here from the beginning."

The bartender polished a beer mug until it squeaked. After maintaining silence for a long while, he casually threw out a comment.

"The boy will be disappointed."

"Hehe. It's okay. At that age, they're supposed to experience heartbreak and such things."

"I thought you liked him?"

"He was interesting. Hah, honestly speaking, it was a little dangerous."

Marsha hugged her shoulders and looked up at the ceiling.

"How can such a disgusting person exist?"

**Priority (1)**

The villa was as quiet as if no one was there.

Amy was sitting on the sofa next to the fireplace, and Rian and Tess couldn't even speak, watching her mood.

Shirone wasn't coming. It had already been two hours since he went shopping, so unless he was pulling fish out of the sea, he should have returned by now.

"Sh-Shirone is late?"

Tess, who spoke up to break the frozen atmosphere, was startled. She felt like her voice sounded louder than usual.

Even so, Amy remained motionless, staring only into the darkness.

'Ugh, it's completely like walking on thin ice.'

Tess shivered. Amy's mood seemed so bad that she could actually feel the chill.

Of course, as a fellow woman, it was completely understandable. Even aside from the meaning of a couple's trip, wasn't this an exciting first vacation for the two of them?

'Shirone, you were too thoughtless. I'm disappointed in you too this time. Tsk!'

Like calls to like, and Tess took Amy's side.

As a woman, she knew how much Amy had compromised for Shirone.

Even though there had been a conflict of opinions at the port, she had readily offered to cook. Men might think 'what's the big deal about that?', but from a woman's perspective, it was the most honest expression of the feeling 'I want to make up with you quickly.'

But Shirone was an hour later than Rian. If he had gotten lost, that could happen, so it wasn't time to worry yet, but Amy wanted him to handle even such minor details responsibly.

"Ugh, I'm hungry. Why isn't he coming? Should I go out and look for him?"

Rian complained thoughtlessly while clutching his stomach. Well, for someone who didn't eat set meals per day, an hour's delay was quite patient for him.

"Forget it. You might miss each other."

"Really? Then can I eat the potatoes I bought?"

Tess glared with fierce eyes and shouted.

"Why are you so insensitive? Think about Amy."

"What's so serious about it? Shirone had more things to buy than me. He could be late."

Tess was frustrated. Though Shirone wasn't her partner, having already sympathized with Amy, she even found Rian hateful.

"Even if Shirone had more to buy, since he's smarter than you, he should come back faster. So this is a very serious problem! You can go to a corner and gobble potatoes or chew on scallions for all I care."

"Why are you so angry? What did I do?"

Rian scratched his head like a bear. Since he was insensitive even to insults directed at him, he couldn't really be called selfish.

Amy spoke for the first time. Perhaps feeling sorry for ruining the atmosphere, she forced a smile.

"Sorry, because of me. Just cook and eat first, you guys. I'll eat with Shirone when he comes."

"We can't do that. It was a cooking competition."

"But Rian is hungry. Anyway, it's Shirone's fault for being late. Let's say we lost."

Tess comforted Amy with a tearful expression.

"It's okay, Amy. Actually, I'm not hungry at all. We just need to do something about that glutton."

Rian was actually chewing raw potatoes in the corner. He was a man who couldn't do Schema but had strength comparable to it.

To maintain such tremendous physical strength, his calorie consumption would be several times higher than normal people, which was somewhat pitiful when you think about it.

As silence continued without reaching a conclusion, Amy put her feet up on the chair and rested her cheek on her knee.

'Why isn't he coming? Is something really wrong?'

He wasn't the type to break promises. Nor was he foolish enough to delay time by making mistakes.

There must have been unavoidable circumstances.

But no matter how much she tried to steady her heart, she couldn't help feeling hurt.

'You brought me here. Everyone else I'm meeting today except you.'

She felt lonely. Though they had become close, Rian and Tess were partners who had a special connection. There was no room for Amy to squeeze between them.

Thump thump. Thump thump.

Someone knocked on the door. Tess's face brightened and Rian clenched his fists at the thought of finally being able to eat.

"Shirone? Wait a minute...!"

Before Tess could finish speaking, Amy walked to the door. With her eyes narrowed, she yanked the door open in irritation and shouted.

"Hey! Where the hell have you been doing what that you're only now... Huh?"

Amy stood with the door thrown open, only blinking her eyes.

It wasn't Shirone. But it wasn't a stranger either. What was certain was that this was someone who shouldn't be here.

Gis, who had quarreled with them at the port, was standing there.

"What? Why are you here?"

Gis's face reddened. Of all people, it had to be this woman who opened the door.

Remembering the day's events made his teeth grind, but seeing her unfamiliar appearance in comfortable clothes made his heart flutter again.

Gathering his wits, Gis brazenly surveyed the interior of the villa. His abdomen, hit by Falcoa, throbbed, but his expression remained composed.

"Wow, this place is really nice. Nobles are definitely different, aren't they?"

"I asked what business you have here? How did you know we were here?"

"I found out by asking around. When the ruler of the port, Gis, puts his mind to it, that much is nothing. Now you know how well I know this island, right?"

"So? Did you come here just to show off that one trick?"
