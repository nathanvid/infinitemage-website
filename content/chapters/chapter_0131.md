"Haha! No. Now that I think about it, I think I was wrong about what happened during the day. Honestly, I did overcharge you. I don't usually take that much, but I guess I got too greedy. Let me restore my honor. I'll show you a really interesting place."

Tess put her hands on her hips and said, "Forget it. I'm already in a bad mood as it is. Amy, just chase him away."

"Right then. Well, goodbye."

As Amy tried to close the door, Gis showed a desperate expression and pushed his hand through the gap.

Though there was no scripted plan, being seasoned in this business, words quickly tumbled out of his mouth.

"W-wait a minute! If your friends don't want to come, you can come alone."

"Why should I? This seems suspicious."

"Fine! I got it! I'll be honest. I actually... got in huge trouble."

"With who?"

"Even street touts have an association. My actions must have reached the higher-ups' ears. So they told me to guide the customers I was rude to around the island. They said if word gets out, tourists won't use touts anymore. Could you just stop by for a little while? Otherwise, I'll completely lose my livelihood. I might really have to beg like a beggar."

"Hmm."

Amy didn't drop her suspicious gaze. Gis, already terrified, anxiously waited for her judgment.

"Fine, I might as well get some fresh air. Wait here while I change clothes."

Gis's head shot up. Of course, that's what he had come for, but he never thought he'd get consent so easily.

Meanwhile, Tess, who had been listening, was dumbfounded. She never expected Amy to fall for such a tout's words.

Thinking Amy's heart was hurt because of Shirone's situation, she hurriedly followed Amy.

"Amy! What are you doing going with him? How can you trust that guy?"

"It's fine. If it seems dangerous, I'll just come back."

"Don't do that, think about it a little more. What about Shirone?"

"Forget it. Tell him to figure it out himself. Rian must be hungry too, how long are we going to make him wait? This actually worked out well. I'll eat outside and come back, so you can spend time alone with Rian."

Amy, who had changed clothes and fixed her hair, went down to the entrance. Tess tried to persuade her until the end, but she was stubborn.

"Do you really have to go? Then you have to come back quickly, okay? Just get some fresh air and come back. If you're late, we'll come looking for you."

"I said I got it. Rian, I'm going out for a bit. When Shirone comes back, let him starve."

Rian was cautious. His ravenously hungry appearance had disappeared, and he was seriously monitoring the situation.

Was it really right to let her go? But if she was being dragged away that would be one thing, but when the person in question wanted to go, it would be ridiculous to step forward and stop her.

"Gis, was it? Let's go."

"Huh? Oh, right!"

Gis was in a daze. From the moment she came down the second-floor stairs wearing a girlish black dress, he couldn't come to his senses.

With Amy also going out, the villa became desolate. Tess, whose head was complicated, sighed and shook her head.

"Ugh, how did it come to this? The atmosphere was good until just a while ago."

"Wouldn't it have been better if I went with her?"

"You fool, don't you understand a woman's heart? How miserable would Amy feel if another person's partner escorted her? But where on earth did Shirone go?"

Rian, who had walked to the window, watched Amy board the carriage.

The stars above the seaside were twinkling as if they would pour down.

* * *

Gis sat across from Amy. Having gotten her into the carriage, the operation could be considered more than 80% successful.

"A-alright! Then we'll depart! Hey, let's go!"

As the coachman nodded and shook the reins, the two-headed horse jolted the cabin and shot forward.

Gis kept his mouth moving without rest. Whether he was truly a local or not, he was rattling off everything in detail, even trivial things you wouldn't want to know. Who cares if the vegetable shop owner is having an affair with a widow?

Amy hadn't said a word until then and was only looking at the night view outside the window. Lost in thought, Gis's words didn't even register in her ears.

At some point, Gis also realized this fact and stopped talking.

Actually, looking at Amy's face like this made him happiest. Her calmly settled expression was completely different from how she looked when angry during the day.

Did Falcoa really intend to sell off this beautiful girl? At first it didn't feel real, but now that he had gotten her into the carriage, fear crept over him.

"It's taking a long time. How far are we going?"

Amy spoke for the first time. Coincidentally hitting the core issue, Gis was startled and made up an answer.

"Ah, well... it's a bit far. It's the best place in Galliant. Really, you'll know when you see it."

"Really? Your boss who recruited me told you to bring me there?"

Gis's heart sank with a thud.

Just how long had she known? From the beginning? Then why on earth had she gotten in the carriage, and why hadn't she said anything until now?

Gis's face remained frozen and wouldn't relax. His mind went blank and no lies came to mind.

"Well, that's..."

"You don't need to deceive me. I can tell just by looking at your eyes. You're terrified and pleading, only an idiot wouldn't notice. Anyway, do your best. I'm only playing along this once."

"Playing... along?"

"That's right. I don't know why you became a sacrificial lamb, but quit after this job is over. I'm saving you because you're so pitiful."

Gis's face flushed hot.

"What! I'm pitiful?"

"Well, aren't you pitiful? Should I be envious instead?"

"This is really...!"

Before Gis could get angry, Amy asked.

"You threw gold coins at me, didn't you?"

"Th-that was..."

Gis avoided her gaze. Just recalling the day's events made his body flinch. Because of that action, he had been beaten to death by Falcoa. It was a trauma he would never forget for life.

"Kids like you don't last long in this business. People with too many things to protect just get used and then discarded."

"Tch, how would you know that? You're a noble who had good parents and lived in luxury."

"At least I know more than you. I once hung around this side too. Of course, I was in a much higher position than you."

Gis bit his lips. In the end, that's how it was. No matter how much he held up his pride and raised his voice, it was impossible to face her at an equal level.

"Are you pitying me?"

"Yes."

"I don't want pity. Absolutely not."

"That's why you should leave this business. This might be your last chance."

Gis felt defeated and hung his head. Her words were right. If she hadn't shown him pity, he and his sister would be experiencing hell by now.

"Tch."

As Gis clicked his tongue, Amy looked out the window. It was as if a cool sea breeze blew in and gently lowered her eyelids.

"I don't dislike kids like you."

"What?"

"About throwing coins at me. A man should have that much backbone. If you were just a back-alley thug, I never would have gotten in this carriage."

Gis's face turned red as a beet.

"Damn it. Giving me sickness and then medicine? This is why I don't like nobles. Earlier too. Mocking some people and stopping others. So completely selfish."

Amy, resting her chin on her hand, smiled wryly.

"Ah, Shirone? That kid's a commoner too. That's probably why he stopped you."

"What? A commoner? He wasn't a noble but a commoner?"

Gis's eyes widened. At first he thought it was a joke. Otherwise, why would such a beautiful girl be traveling with a man of lower status than himself?

"That's right, a commoner. What does that matter? Or does it matter?"

"But weren't they partners? They looked like a couple on vacation."

"Right, we're partners. My partner who brought me to this remote island across the sea and then disappeared somewhere..."

Amy smiled sadly with her cat-like lips. Watching her eyes grow distant and wistful, Gis's mind became tangled in confusion.

Maybe he had been thinking wrong from the beginning? He should have just picked up the gold coins that fell on the ground. Then, even if his pride was hurt, the current situation wouldn't have happened.

'Damn it! Hell! She's risking danger out of pity for me? Does she even know what the danger is?'

This girl was taking it too lightly.

Falcoa was the action captain of the Freeman organization. What was the Freeman organization? The ruler of Galliant who commanded terrifying elite soldiers.

When Gis was young, the island's commercial rights were divided and controlled by various organizations. Occasionally there were power struggles, but the balance of power had never been broken.

But after the Freeman organization landed on the island five years ago, the situation changed rapidly.

They expanded their influence at tremendous speed, and the existing organizations were disbanded without even being able to resist. Finally a coalition was formed to face the Freeman organization, but it was shattered in a pathetically simple manner.

The time it took for the war to end was only three months.

The Freeman organization was a combat group of monsters that had disbanded all organizations in just three months.

'It's not just Falcoa. All the gangsters above me are terrifying bastards. I'm taking this girl to such a place right now.'

Gis clenched his fists. He wanted to stop her, but his mouth wouldn't open.

Since she was a magic school student, maybe she could escape. But his younger sister couldn't. If Falcoa put his mind to it, he could make a street tout's sister disappear without anyone knowing.

'I have to protect her. At least my sister... definitely!'

* * *

After parting with Marsha, Shirone arrived at the beach. He had run without stopping so his legs were shaking, but the real ordeal was just beginning. Since the villa was halfway up the mountain, he had to climb uphill.

"Phew, why is my luck so bad today? I keep having to run."

Since the sun had set, Rian and Tess would be cooking.

If Amy was still waiting, he had to deliver the sad news as quickly as possible. The sad news that he had left the shopping basket behind.

'Either way, I'm dead.'

Shirone gritted his teeth and ran up the uphill road. When he arrived at the villa, he was out of breath up to his chin.

Walking to the entrance as if about to collapse, Shirone knocked on the door while bent over at the waist.

"Rian, Amy, Tess. I'm back. Please open the door. Ugh!"

When the door suddenly opened, Shirone fell forward. It was a much more immediate response than expected.

"Shirone! Where have you been all this time? Do you know how long Amy waited?"

"Ah, sorry. There was a good reason for it. Let me go inside first and talk. My legs are shaking."

There was no smell of food in the villa. Shirone, who had hoped the three of them would have eaten first, felt even more sorry.

"You waited a long time because of me, right? But where's Amy?"

Tess didn't know how to explain. Should she say Amy got tired of waiting and went out to have fun? Or that she was disappointed in a man named Shirone and followed Gis?

"What's wrong? Your expression doesn't look good. Did something happen?"

"Well... ah, this is awkward."

The reason Tess couldn't speak was because she didn't want to cause unnecessary misunderstandings in their relationship.

But Rian grasped the core of the situation.

"She went out with that guy Gis we met at the port."

"Huh? Gis? You mean that person who overcharged us? Why did Amy follow him?"

"I don't know. While waiting for you, the guy suddenly showed up. He said he wanted to make up for what happened during the day. So they took a carriage and went somewhere."

"Amy went along willingly? Without any reason?"

Tess interjected.

"Right! This is all because you came late. Amy was so lonely by herself. Tell me, what exactly happened?"

Shirone postponed his answer. Now wasn't the time to be arguing about such things.

"Let's go. Do you know where?"

"How would we know? Why are you so worried? If you were going to be like this, you should have treated her well from the beginning."

"She didn't go out because of me."

"What are you talking about? Amy was so angry!"

"Amy is hot-tempered but doesn't act emotionally. Even if she was angry because of someone, she wouldn't do something to worry that person. She would rather wait for me to come back and beat me to death."

Tess's face went blank. Since it was Shirone speaking, who knew Amy well, it was probably right.

And now that she thought about it, that seemed right too. She got angry easily but had a tender heart, and though she seemed prickly, she was very considerate, wasn't she?

"B-but surely nothing could happen, right? He's just a tout after all. Amy is outstanding even at magic school, right?"
