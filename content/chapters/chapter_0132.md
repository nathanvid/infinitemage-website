Of course, there was no doubt about Amy's abilities. But Shirone thought differently. Just thirty minutes ago, he had heard from Marsha about how dangerous the island was.

Harbor touts had their own networks of power. Especially street touts were said to be low-level subordinates of powerful organizations.

"She told me to be careful of people like Gis. Even if that's not the case, the island is a closed-off and dangerous place. Things that would be unimaginable on the mainland can be easily handled here. Many nobles go missing on the island. I can't just assume Amy is safe."

Rian strapped his straight sword to his leather scabbard.

"No need for lengthy explanations. Let's go, Shirone. Lead the way anywhere. I'll handle anyone who gets in our way."

"Thanks. Actually, it's my fault for being late."

"You must have had your reasons. First, we need to confirm Amy's safety."

Tess watched the two boys. This was exactly the kind of conversation between those bound by knightly oaths. It was still just imitation, but for her who dreamed of becoming a knight, it was an enviable sight.

"Wait a minute. I'm coming too. You're not the only ones worried about Amy."

The three left the villa and went down to the beach. But when it came to actually searching, they couldn't figure out where to start.

Facing the vast white sand beach, Tess's confidence wavered.

"Where should we look for Amy? At this hour, the only place that guy Gis could take her would be the commercial district. Should we split up and search there instead?"

"That doesn't seem like a good approach. After all, the three of us can't cover the entire commercial district. Most importantly, we don't know the geography here well."

"Then what do we do? There's no way to find her. We might as well look for a needle in that white sand."

Shirone rested his chin on his hand, lost in thought.

"Instead of that, let's go to the harbor. They said there's definitely an organization. If that's the case, we might be able to find out Amy's location by asking the organization members."

"The harbor? That's to the south, isn't it? Wouldn't it be faster to search here in the time it takes to get there? Amy probably isn't at the harbor anyway since it's not a tourist spot."

"No, going to the harbor is right. If we simply divide Amy's situation into two possibilities: First, Amy is safe. Second, Amy is not safe. If she's safe, there's no loss even if we go to the harbor. But if she's not safe, we must go to the harbor. The only way Amy wouldn't be safe is if there's a conflict with Gis's organization. Therefore, regardless of which situation we assume, we need to go to the harbor first and make contact with the organization members."

"That... that's right. It would be."

Tess nodded as if hypnotized. It was the first time she felt someone's words moved faster than her own thoughts.

Rian didn't think. From the moment Shirone suggested going to the harbor, he was already arranging for a carriage.

When Rian, who had paid the coachman, gestured for them to get on, Shirone and Tess ran over. They threw themselves into the racing carriage and entered the passenger compartment.

The coachman burst into cheerful laughter and increased speed.

"Youth is wonderful indeed. Must be some urgent business at this hour?"

"Yes. Please hurry!"

"Alright! Then let's give my horses some exercise for the first time in a while! Giddy up!"

The roads were quiet at night. Using gold coins as motivation, the coachman drove the horses so hard that the carriage rattled.

The carriage reached the harbor in twenty minutes, and the coachman boasted it was a record in five years.

The three ran to the harbor.

Most of the ships were docked, and light leaked through window gaps, indicating people were aboard. Probably sailors playing card games.

Ships floating in nearby waters were also suspicious, but it was too late to search every nook and cranny on foot.

Shirone focused his search on the taverns at the harbor. Most looked like organization members, but in reality, many were just sailors.

"What should we do? Can we find her like this?"

"We can find her. There's at least one person here."

Shirone persistently questioned the taverns. Finally, he found a clue in a small bar.

Their eyes were so swollen he didn't recognize them at first, but they were definitely the touts who had been with Gis during the day, drinking.

"There, those two people! They're the ones who were with Gis, right?"

"That's right. Leave it to me from now on."

Rian cracked his knuckles as he walked out. He knew that in situations like this, appearance mattered more than skill.

"Hey, you remember me?"

"What? Looking for trouble? I'm in a really shitty mood right now... Huh!"

The boy who had been snapping back with slurred speech recognized Rian and stood up.

Rian's build was intimidating, but the real reason for their shock was something else. They knew what Gis, who had been caught by Falcoa, had gone to do.

"Uh, well... you see..."

"I know, I know everything. So let's talk somewhere quiet. I have a personality that gets violent in crowded places but becomes gentle in quiet places. What'll it be?"

The tout glanced at his friend sitting at the table. The moment their eyes briefly met, without anyone taking the lead, they both started running toward the door.

"Damn it! Run!"

They ran frantically. But no matter how much they ran, the door didn't get any closer.

'What's this? Why is this happening? Is this a dream?'

Only after the tension of escape faded did they realize their legs were floating in the air.

"I'll give you one last chance. Will you come along nicely, or should I plant you upside down right here?"

Rian, lifting one boy in each hand, extended his arms as if showing off his strength.

The boys were terrified. Supporting the weight of two men with arms extended was beyond strength - it was monstrous power.

"We'll go. We'll go, so please don't use force."

From then on, things were easy. Rian took the touts to the breakwater where he could hear the general situation.

"So this guy Falcoa ordered you to bring Amy?"

"Yes. Gis got beaten to death. We almost died too. You shouldn't mess with Falcoa. That bastard is completely insane."

"Doesn't matter. Every crazy person who's faced my fists has come to their senses. Where did you take Amy? You know the location, right?"

"We really don't know the location! Please believe us!"

"Really? Then I'll ask your friend. So you're choosing to give up the chance for two people to live and pick having only one survive."

The two boys looked at each other fearfully. Honestly, they didn't have the mental strength to endure torture. But Rian was only subduing them with words alone. It was thanks to learning interrogation techniques at the sword school.

"We really don't know. But there is a place we suspect."

Shirone and Tess approached closer. Rian also stopped his clumsy investigator act and grabbed the tout's collar.

"Where is it? Speak quickly!"

"The, the Palace."

"Palace? What nonsense is that?"

"It's the name of a tavern. The biggest tavern on Galliant! Any carriage you catch will take you there! Listen, you absolutely can't say we told you! Or we'll die!"

Rian turned around without time to answer. Shirone and Tess were already ready to run.

As they left the harbor, they saw a carriage waiting. Coincidentally, it was the same carriage that had brought them here.

"Sir! Coachman sir!"

The coachman, who had been sitting on the luggage rack smoking his pipe, turned his head. The customers who had enjoyed a magnificent ride with him and his beloved horses were running toward him in a hurry.

"Well, finished sightseeing already? Fast at running and fast at sightseeing too. Ha ha ha!"

"Sir, let's go now! It's urgent!"

"Of course it's urgent. Youth is urgent! Come on, get in quickly!"

The coachman jumped down from the luggage rack with boiling passion.

Starting the horses first, the coachman turned around and shouted. His voice naturally grew louder due to the wind.

"So, where to this time!"

Shirone, Rian, and Tess shouted simultaneously.

"The Palace!"

* * *

Tavern Palace.

The magnificent tavern that wouldn't be out of place with a "Palace" sign was arguably the most brilliant place on the island.

The four-story building showed exactly what waste of money looked like. All kinds of gold and silver treasures that reflected light were decorated, and magic crystal lamps that ordinary people couldn't even see glowed brightly.

Shirone's group was overwhelmed by the wealth the building radiated. It felt like they had arrived at a place they shouldn't enter.

As Shirone walked toward the tavern, a guard blocking the entrance stepped forward as expected.

"Hey, you can't wear weapons in here...!"

Rian didn't even listen and pushed the guard's throat. Though similar in build to Rian, his strength was no match.

By the time the struggling, breathless guard regained consciousness, Shirone's group had already entered the establishment.

The inside of the tavern was filled with people's voices.

Women so scantily clad it seemed inappropriate danced around, and profanity, curses, and all kinds of lewd talk crossed through the air.

Tess frowned. Galliant appeared to be a peaceful resort on the surface, but when the sun set, it transformed into a place where such murky desires swirled.

"Is Amy really in a place like this? There are so many people, and what are those women anyway? Aren't they embarrassed?"

"I know. It's definitely not a place Amy would like. But since she followed willingly, she might have accepted it and come in. And be careful. No matter what happens here, security won't respond."

Having heard about the island's situation from Marsha, Shirone was certain. Though used differently, this was also one of the places where some kind of deal had been made with the government.

Unable to find Amy on the first floor, they went up to the second floor. A deadly gambling scene was unfolding.

The third floor had rooms lined up with iron doors installed in a cross-shaped corridor, and the fourth floor was VIP rooms where the highest nobility stayed.

After searching each floor thoroughly, Rian let out a disappointed sigh.

"It'll be hard to find her like this. She's not in the hall or the gambling den. To search the third floor, we'd have to enter every room, and the fourth floor is swarming with bodyguards."

It was time to make a choice. Whether to politely ask permission and search thoroughly like hunting lice, or to properly cause an incident.

Of course, the three's decision was the latter. Having learned that Amy had been dragged away by malicious conspiracy, they had no intention of leaving quietly.

"There they are! Those bastards!"

The guard who had been roughly handled at the entrance pointed at Shirone's group. Then a man from behind rolled up his sleeves and approached.

Rian had to look up to meet the man's eyes. He was so huge his head nearly touched the ceiling.

"A troubleshooter, I suppose?"

Establishments with shady backgrounds naturally screened their customers. Usually they were filtered out at the guard level, but there were quite a few who forced their way in and caused trouble. The troubleshooter's job was to handle such people with violence.

"What's this? Just snot-nosed brats? No wait, looking closer, this girl isn't just any kid."

The troubleshooter looked down at Tess, flaring his nostrils. Having an unusually high vantage point, he could survey Tess's voluptuous appeal more clearly than anyone.

"Heh heh heh, someone like you would be a perfect customer for this establishment. Let's see, shall uncle give you an evaluation?"

The troubleshooter's hand reached toward Tess. Just opening his palm made it feel like a net was spread before her eyes.

Tess firmly grabbed the troubleshooter's middle finger. Then she bent it upward with all her strength.

"Aaaahhh!"

The huge frame twisted comically. His arm was completely extended and his middle finger was bent enough to touch the back of his hand.

"It hurts! It hurts!"

"Hmph! You should have been careful. Even though I'm a woman, my arm strength is stronger than your middle finger. This is what happens when you rely only on your size and act cocky."

"Aaargh! This bitch!"

Unable to bear the pain, the troubleshooter threw a punch with his other hand. Tess released the finger she was holding and twisted her body like lightning, swinging her elbow.

A crisp single strike hit the troubleshooter's chin and passed by. The timing was perfect, making it seem as if the opponent had deliberately approached to get hit.

The troubleshooter's brain vibrated and his consciousness cut out. As Tess stepped aside, the giant's body fell like an old tree with a crash.
