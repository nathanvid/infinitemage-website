"T-this can't be..."

Gido was dumbfounded. He never expected that Galliant Island's most notorious enforcer would fall to a single blow from a woman.

Rian shook his head as he watched Tess dusting off her hands. With things like this, where was there even room for a man to step in?

Elzaine swordsmanship was famous for its precise attacks. Trained to strike vital points in any situation, she was a technical fighter who could instantly eliminate the gap created by differences in strength or build.

'Reaching the tip of the chin with minimal movement requires murderous concentration. You should consider yourself lucky. If Tess had drawn her sword, you'd already be dead.'

Shirone stared blankly at the motionless enforcer. Was this the movement of a swordsman who stood as an equal to mages?

If Rian's strength was avant-garde, then Tess's strike was like watching a perfect work of art.

"Wow, that was really cool, Tess."

"Hehe! Not bad, right? Shirone really does have an eye for these things. Unlike someone standing next to me."

Rian half-listened as he approached Gido.

Gido was trembling with fear in both legs. When Rian grabbed his throat and lifted him up, he made a last desperate struggle.

"Kuk! Do you know where you are?"

"I came here because I know where this is. Does it look like we're playing hide and seek? Where's Amy right now?"

"Damn! Who's Amy? How the hell would I know?"

"Should I stop your heart instead of killing you?"

"Shit! I really don't know! If you're so curious, go find her yourself!"

"This bastard really!"

Fire blazed in Rian's eyes. He was already dying from anxiety, and this guy was rubbing salt in the wound. Wasn't this exactly why he was doing this—because he didn't have time to search?

Just as he was about to increase the pressure to intimidate him further, Shirone approached.

"Rian, that's enough. What's the point of asking about something he doesn't know?"

"Then what do we do? Are we really going to go room by room?"

"No, we should ask about something he does know."

"Something he knows? Like what?"

When Gido met eyes with Shirone, he flinched in surprise.

A different kind of anger from Rian's. A chill rose up, making his bones feel like they were freezing.

"Ask him where Falcoa is."

* * *

The Royal Palace tavern. Basement level 1.

Those in the know called this place the Temple. Of course, no gods dwelled here. But sometimes people did see gods—due to the hallucinogenic effects caused by Loop.

Ultimately, the VIP rooms on the 4th floor were just places for tourists who came based on rumors, and all the real action was underground.

The Temple was a space for those mad with pleasure, where all kinds of drugs were distributed and Loop, a stimulant, could be enjoyed without limit.

The Temple was divided into 17 sections and had a total area 1.5 times wider than the first floor.

It was always packed, but only Room 4 was never opened to customers—because it was Falcoa's room, the action captain of the Freeman organization and owner of the Royal Palace.

"So I asked him: Do you want to be buried after you die, or die after you're buried? Do you know what that bastard said?"

"Uhehe, what did he say, boss? What did he say?"

Falcoa pretended to be dying and shouted.

"Pleeease spare me!"

"Waaaaah! This is killing me! Pleeease spare me!"

"Puhahaha! My stomach hurts from laughing so much! Pleeease spare me!"

Falcoa's subordinates pounded the table and burst into wild laughter. But Gis couldn't understand it at all.

'Crazy bastards. What the hell is so funny about this? They're not in their right minds.'

"Oh honey, why aren't you drinking?"

Gis just shook his head without even making eye contact with his partner. If he drank alcohol in this place, he felt like he'd never see tomorrow's rising sun.

Gis subtly turned his head to look at Falcoa's partner. Amy, whom he had brought, was sitting there.

Of course, she also didn't understand Falcoa's sense of humor and was just staring straight ahead with an expressionless face.

'She's really amazing. I'm scared to death, but her expression hasn't changed at all.'

Any ordinary woman, especially a young girl, should normally be trembling with fear when surrounded by such brutal gang members. But there wasn't a trace of tension to be found on Amy's face.

'Ah, so noisy. So boring. I want to go back.'

Amy moistened her lips with the alcohol placed in front of her. Though she had learned about drinking as a noble, she wasn't someone who enjoyed alcohol and didn't drink originally. Even adding up all the sips she'd taken out of boredom, it would barely cover the bottom of the bottle.

But alcohol was still alcohol, and as her mood lifted slightly, she fell into somewhat sentimental thoughts.

'What am I doing here right now?'

Of course, she had come along because she felt sorry for Gis. But thinking about it carefully, it didn't seem like that was the only reason.

'He should be back by now, shouldn't he?'

Why was Shirone late? Perhaps he had gotten caught up in another pointless commotion.

From Shirone's omniscient perspective looking down, how many pitiful people were there in the world?

'Hehe, did I want to imitate him, even a little?'

Come to think of it, her reason for coming here wasn't any different.

She had simply heard the scream of a scoundrel she'd met at the harbor—a scoundrel who didn't seem to have fallen completely to the bottom—begging to be saved.

The atmosphere at the drinking table gradually ripened. The more it did, the more irritated Amy became.

If they had used force, she could have used her own strength and left immediately, but contrary to expectations, Falcoa maintained his manners.

'What exactly is he thinking? Should I make the first move?'

While Amy was lost in such thoughts, Falcoa was also conscious of Amy, wearing a wicked smile.

'I can hear the sound of her mind working from here.'

Amy was probably a high-ranking noble. She had that noble hauteur that couldn't be compensated for by appearance alone.

But Falcoa was completely at ease. He had the finest weapon for subduing nobles.

No, with this one thing, he could make even a king kneel at his feet.

It was Loop.

Even now in the Temple, countless high-ranking nobles had become slaves to Loop.

If he gradually led them into Loop at the right time, no matter how proud a noble was, they wouldn't be able to resist.

"Come on, come on. Let's toast, toast!"

At that moment, the sound of something crashing came from beyond the partition. Then the shouts of employees erupted.

"What are you guys! Kuk!"

"Hey! Stop them! That's the boss's room!"

The door burst open and three people entered.

When Gis confirmed the faces of the intruders, he stood up as if he'd seen ghosts. They were Amy's friends he'd seen at the harbor.

Falcoa's expression immediately crumpled. While he might forgive troublesome customers if they paid several times more, having his territory, the Temple, invaded was a matter of pride.

"What? What's going on?"

When Falcoa spoke in a voice devoid of laughter, the direct subordinates sitting around him jumped up. Then the women, knowing these guys' temperaments, started to discreetly evacuate.

"Shirone? How did you know to come here?"

Amy asked with wide eyes.

But Shirone delayed his answer. An irritating energy was crawling up his spine like mad.

The guy sitting arrogantly in the seat of honor with his legs crossed in a figure-four must be Falcoa. He didn't particularly look like a monster, but you could tell at first glance that he wasn't normal.

'He's strong, that person...'

Displaying killing intent was easy. If you really stared with the intention to kill, even an ordinary person could intimidate their opponent. But subtly emanating killing intent, present yet absent, wasn't easy.

It was an aura that only a professional killer could emit.

'Amy...'

Why was Amy sitting next to such a person?

In front of her, who enjoyed tea and coffee, there was not a teacup but a wine glass. The floor was dirty and the smell was stale. Nothing she had seen in her room existed in this place.

Therefore... being here was not her will.

"Let's go back, Amy."

Amy felt a surge of emotion. After taking such a long pause, the words he finally uttered were just "Let's go back, Amy." When she was waiting, he was nowhere to be seen, yet what was with this confident attitude?

Amy was angry at herself for being happy to see Shirone just moments before. From what perspective was Shirone currently looking at her? From human eye level, or from high up in the sky?

This wasn't what she wanted. That's why she didn't want to receive Shirone's help either. If she put her mind to it, she could leave right now.

"You, you guys! Do you know where you're barging into!"

All the tavern employees came rushing over. But they couldn't dare enter the room of the demon-like Falcoa.

Shirone was amazed. A boss that even his subordinates feared. Just how deep and intense was this person's evil?

Falcoa spoke in an annoyed tone, lowering his voice.

"What are you guys? Do you know what happens when you enter my room without permission?"

"I came to take Amy. Release her."

"Heh, anyone listening would think we kidnapped her. Even nobles should be careful about certain things. Especially in a place like this."

Shirone's guess was correct. This place was an extraterritorial zone under the protection of the island government.

"What are you doing? Send the brats back."

"Where should we send them, boss?"

Falcoa let out a breath and said.

"To hell."

The direct subordinates in Room 4 loosened up and approached. Their energy was on a different level from the employees they'd passed by so far.

Tess took a stance to draw her sword and said.

"Shirone, be careful. These guys are all Schema users."

A gleam appeared in Shirone's eyes. Since it was Tess speaking, with her good eye for detail, it was probably true.

Of course, most students at sword schools could open Schema. But the fact that not a single one of the thugs living on this island—not even the mainland—lacked the ability to use Schema was definitely strange.

'Who exactly is he? How can a mere tavern owner command such skilled fighters?'

Shirone stared intently at the subordinates blocking his path. At that moment, an enormous emotion struck Shirone's heart.

"Kuk!"

"Shirone, be careful! It's Pressing!"

Among the "eye techniques" in Schema physical arts, there were many abilities, but Pressing was the most popular technique among them.

It was good for practical use because of its intuitive reaction, and it was easy to master once you knew how to emit emotions outward.

Shirone didn't panic. The moment the opponent's hostility pressed down on his lungs, he realized it was the same technique he'd experienced from Adel, the head butler of the Carmis family.

But the quality of emotion was on a different dimension. If Adel's Pressing was simply meant to overwhelm the opponent, these people's Pressing was rushing in solely to end lives.

Rian gripped the handle of his straight sword and took a step forward.

"How dare you!"

"Rian! Wait!"

When Shirone shouted, Falcoa's subordinates raised their eyebrows in puzzlement. This was Pressing with the killing intent of no fewer than 10 people applied simultaneously. Far from being able to speak, his heart should have already stopped.

But Shirone was still standing. With a faint smile on his lips, no less.

The only person who understood this situation was Amy.

'Diamond Body. In some ways, it's an ability that rivals my Insight.'

Pressing couldn't shake Shirone. No, perhaps it might be possible, but their level was nowhere near enough.

Shirone slowly moved forward. As if the atmosphere itself was being pushed back, the subordinates retreated with the same stride.

Of course, it wasn't easy for Shirone to let emotions flow either.

This was pressure being injected by 10 veterans who had experienced countless battles.

You couldn't put a price on emotions, but by estimation, it was like being tied hand and foot on the ground, waiting for a carriage rushing from afar.

More precisely, it was the terror of the moment when that carriage had arrived right before his eyes, and the giant wheel filled his entire field of vision.

In reality, since death awaited, the time to feel fear would only last 0.1 seconds, but currently Shirone had been feeling the same emotion for over 20 seconds.
