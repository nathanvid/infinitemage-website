In short, it wasn't an emotional intensity that could exist in reality. If Diamond Body wavered even 1 percent, the nervous system shock might stop her heart.

But Amy wasn't worried. The reason it could be called Diamond Body was precisely because not even that 1 percent would waver.

Shirone finally pushed his subordinates all the way to the table. Falcoa, watching this spectacle, twisted his face in anger.

"What are you all doing! Slit his throat right now!"

The subordinates all drew their long swords from their waists and charged forward in unison.

"Damn it! How embarrassing to have to use swords on a kid!"

At that moment, light burst forth from Shirone's body in a brilliant flash. The flash that erupted in the enclosed space blinded the subordinates' vision.

"Grk! What is this!"

As befitting those who had mastered eye techniques, their dark adaptation was fast enough to exceed human limits. But they didn't move. Neither the subordinates nor Falcoa moved—they just stared blankly at Shirone.

"What? What are you going to do by emitting light?"

Shirone turned his palm upward and floated a sphere of light. Golden photons compressed at tremendous speed, becoming pale and discolored.

"Shirone, you don't mean to...?"

Before the overwhelming power of photons vibrating at an unmeasurable frequency, Amy finally realized what it was.

Magic that accelerates mass to near-light speed to generate shock waves. It was the Photon Cannon.

"Shirone! That thing...!"

It wouldn't be easy to avoid a Photon Cannon in an enclosed space. Eventually someone would take a direct hit, and if that happened, there would inevitably be casualties.

Before Amy could finish speaking, Shirone raised the white sphere. Then he drove it into the ground with all his might.

The moment the flash struck downward, a tremendous roar spread through the room like thunder right before their eyes, shaking everything inside.

"Grk! What, what is this!"

Everyone in the room covered their ears. As the shock wave spread through the ground, the underground structures trembled violently. Clouds of dust poured down from the ceiling.

The subordinates were as flustered as if they had survived a natural disaster. The echo of the roar that couldn't escape the underground still lingered in their ears.

Only after a long while did the organization members look back at where Shirone's magic had struck. Surprisingly, the floor wasn't deeply excavated. But the flattened area exceeded 4 meters in diameter.

"What the... isn't this underground?"

The subordinates couldn't believe what they were seeing.

This was the Temple, which could be said to be the most solid structure on Galliant. To create underground spaces, construction methods focused on durability were essential. In fact, thick steel plates were laid on the Temple's floor.

If those steel plates had been pressed down so extensively, it made sense that the entire underground had shaken. In other words, it wasn't an impact force that humans could withstand.

Like veterans, the subordinates didn't show crying expressions. But they kept their distance as much as possible and remained wary of Shirone.

Seeing this, Falcoa's expression crumpled again.

Not only had he overcome ten Pressing users, but the current magic was a type that even he, who had roamed countless battlefields, was seeing for the first time.

"You... who exactly are you? Which line are you from?"

The vast network of mages connecting the continent is called a line. But Shirone didn't know the terminology used in mage society. He simply revealed his origins with dignity.

"I'm Shirone, a student at Alpheas Magic School."

Gis looked back at Shirone in shock. While origins could be a golden lifeline for nobles, in some situations they could also become shackles.

Having been harshly treated at the harbor, Shirone couldn't have been unaware of this fact. So why had he revealed his origins?

"A student? How absurd. You're saying a mere student caused all this trouble? Hey, you know what? If I report this to the school, you're finished that very day. You'll probably be expelled."

"Report me all you want."

Falcoa's eyebrows twitched at the unexpected reaction.

"I don't care about disciplinary action or expulsion. Such things won't control my life. Of course, the school is an important place to me. But there are plenty of things in this world that are more important than that. And Amy..."

Shirone glared at Falcoa as he continued.

"Takes priority over everything I've ranked."

Amy blinked her eyes. The increasingly rapid speed of her eyelids seemed to represent her heartbeat.

"I don't mind receiving disciplinary action. Sue me if you want. But Amy won't stay in this place for even one second. If you drag my friend to this filthy place even once more, I'll really smash everything to pieces."

With a swoosh, Rian's straight sword was drawn with a watery sound. The intimidating presence of the great sword, as tall as an ordinary person, was tremendous just by being pointed forward.

"As expected of Shirone. My eyes weren't wrong."

Rian realized why his sword hadn't been readily drawn until now. Like a small crack bringing down an iceberg, the trivial obstacle of disciplinary action must have disturbed his conviction.

"You're right, Shirone. Being afraid of disciplinary action and putting a friend in danger? That would be a joke. Ozent Rian has never lived like that for even a moment."

Following Rian, Tess's thin sword was drawn.

"Ho ho ho! Elzaine Tess is the same! We can't leave Amy, the mascot of Shirone's faction, in this thug den!"

Rian looked at Tess with an expression of disbelief.

"Since when is it Shirone's faction?"

"Oh come on, just let it slide at times like this. You really have no tact."

After snapping at Rian, Tess looked at Amy. She was still deep in thought, but her cheeks were more flushed than before.

A tender smile crossed Tess's lips.

'How nice for you, Amy.'

Being a woman herself, Tess could guess her feelings.

To Shirone, Amy wasn't just a dot viewed from an omniscient perspective. She was an irreplaceable friend. No, perhaps something even more than that.

Having pushed back the subordinates' approach with his momentum, Shirone walked to Amy. Then he extended his hand and repeated his initial words.

"Let's go back, Amy."

Amy, having finished her thoughts, raised her head and spoke.

"...Yes."

As Amy stood up, Falcoa's face turned red with anger. These brats had swarmed in making a commotion and now were leaving as they pleased.

'Has the great Falcoa fallen this far?'

It had been five years since the entire organization had hidden on the island to avoid continental pursuers. Many things had happened, but to him, everything was just boring.

Thanks to that, his brain was pickled in drugs and his mind, which once knew only blood, had grown rusty. But just five years ago, Falcoa had traversed the continent and cut down countless people.

Back then, he was a being that existed to cut down someone. Even the boss couldn't ignore Falcoa's skills, which was why he hadn't been expelled until now.

"Hey, you don't think you can leave here safely, do you?"

Amy stopped walking and looked back at Falcoa.

"If you cause trouble here, it'll be inconvenient for you too. The underground guests are drug addicts and probably your best source of funding. Sue us all you want. But our side won't stay quiet either. This establishment will probably have to close down."

"You relied on just that to act up? Sorry, but there's no one on this island who can touch me."

"But the mainland would be a different story."

Falcoa frowned as he looked at Amy. Her eyes were burning red.

'Insight. So she was a Carmis.'

Falcoa knew of the famous Carmis family on the continent. The ability to save the state of a specific moment and restore it at any time.

No drug could addict them, and no substance could penetrate. The Carmis family wasn't called invincible in the mental realm for nothing.

'So she was fish I couldn't catch from the beginning? That girl came along knowing everything.'

Falcoa ground his teeth with an expressionless face.

If it was the Carmis family, they were First-class nobility, so if she took action, it wouldn't be impossible for the fortress he had built over five years to crumble.

The funds earned from distributing Loop were enormous. No matter how out of his mind Falcoa was, he was sensitive about money. Without money, he couldn't buy Loop.

"Keke! Impudent girl. I'll definitely repay this humiliation!"

"Try it if you can. But you'd better be careful the next time we meet. Since it's come to this, I'm thinking of playing properly without worrying about school."

After giving Falcoa a definitive retort, Amy returned to Shirone's group.

"Sorry for worrying you. Let's go now."

Not wanting to stay in this place even a moment longer, they quickened their pace and came up to the surface. Employees were watching at every passage, but no one could block their path.

As they left the tavern, they could feel the air change distinctly. Tess spread both arms and breathed in the night air.

"Whew, what a good feeling. Thanks to Amy, we got a proper tour. We went around the most famous royal palace on Galliant Island from the basement to the top."

"Haha! That's exactly right. Plus we went to the beach, stopped by the harbor, and toured the commercial district, so we've been everywhere except the ruins, haven't we?"

Hearing Rian's words, Amy was startled.

"What? You guys went all the way to the harbor?"

"Yeah. Shirone said it would be faster to catch an organization member and ask. We ran around frantically. If it hadn't been for that passionate coachman, we almost wouldn't have made it in time."

Amy glanced at Shirone. When their eyes met, she quickly averted her gaze. She didn't yet have the courage to look at his face properly.

She recalled Shirone's words from underground. There was no need to misinterpret—it was just about the importance of friends, but that was enough.

How had she not known? When she was falling from the cliff, Shirone was the only one who called her name and grabbed her hand.

Amy could be satisfied with realizing the meaning of that.

"Amy, sorry for being late. I'll tell you about it when we get back. There were special circumstances on the way here."

"Hmph, I'm not even curious! Why should I have to listen to that kind of story?"

"Are you still not over being angry?"

The anger was already gone. But Amy thought it would be better to keep acting angry like this.

"Let's get this straight. You're not having strange fantasies about today's events, are you? Like a prince on a white horse saving a princess, that sort of thing."

"Huh? I'm not."

"I'm grateful that you came to help, but I wasn't captured—I followed along for personal reasons. Even if you hadn't helped, those guys would be no match for me."

"Haha! I know. I'm Class 4 and you're a graduating class—who would worry about whom?"

When Shirone readily agreed, Amy felt deflated instead.

"Hmph, well... as long as you understand. That's just how it is."

Tess held her stomach and laughed heartily. Now it felt like Amy had returned to being the original Amy.

Rian turned toward the commercial district and shouted.

"I'm hungry! Should we buy some late-night snacks on the way back?"

"Late-night snacks? Great! So great! Yahoo!"

* * *

Gis could only return home after midnight due to cleaning up the tavern.

After being beaten, getting tense, and even doing labor, his body felt heavy as if his weight had doubled.

Still, he could endure it thanks to the relief that the feared incident hadn't occurred.

Amy had safely escaped from Falcoa's clutches. Of course, he himself hadn't suffered any particular harm either.

Since he had done his job properly, even Falcoa wouldn't have justification to beat him up.

'If it hadn't been for that girl, I might have died.'

Amy's face came to mind as clearly as if she were real.

Among all the women Gis had ever met, there was none as strong and beautiful as her. Why had such an amazing person tried to help him?

'Shirone? That kid said he was a commoner too.'

Gis remembered every word Shirone had said in the tavern without omission.
