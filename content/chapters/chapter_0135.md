At that time, he had been too frightened to intervene, but his heart had felt exactly the same as Shirone's.

However, when Shirone had extended his hand to Amy, and when Amy had responded to that call, Gis had awakened from his dream.

He could never become like Shirone.

"Tch, he's also a commoner but acts so cool."

If Shirone had been the type to show off just because he learned a little magic, Gis wouldn't have felt jealous. When dealing with arrogant nobles, he sometimes even thought it was fortunate to be born a commoner.

But Shirone was also a commoner. And he had the courage to give up something precious for a friend.

Gis recalled the sad smile Amy had worn in the carriage. Did Shirone know the meaning of that smile? No, he would never know. It was a glimpse of her heart that she had revealed only because they meant nothing to each other.

Thinking about it made his stomach churn again.

"Damn it! Why does he have to be a commoner? I can't even find an excuse to hate him! What kind of guy is that!"

After venting his frustration in front of his house, Gis opened the door and went inside. Seeing a candle lit deep in the main room, it seemed his younger sister had been waiting up for him.

"Brother, why are you so late? I was worried something had happened."

"Yuna, why aren't you sleeping? How are you going to work tomorrow?"

"How could I sleep when you weren't home yet? What happened?"

"No. It's nothing. I was just busy, so time passed like this."

Gis knelt in front of Yuna. Not just because she was his sister, but she was someone who wouldn't be inferior anywhere. Moreover, despite having no formal education, she was wise and kind-hearted.

Yuna was Gis's pride. That's why he couldn't let her live the same shabby life as himself. He didn't wish for success or anything like that, but she was a girl who could easily meet a good man and build a happy life.

"Why does your face look so haggard? Tell me honestly. You can fool everyone else, but you can't fool me. Otherwise, I won't make you breakfast tomorrow morning?"

"Hahaha! Oh, how scary. I just had something happen that hurt my pride. But it's okay now."

"Geez, is your pride always getting hurt? It's so rotten you can't even eat it. Anyway, go wash up first. The sweat smell from you is no joke."

Gis's eyes naturally warmed. Seeing her put his mind at ease. What did it matter if he wasn't as great as others? With Yuna around, he envied nothing in the world.

Gis hugged Yuna. The familiar scent of family that shared the same smell swept away the fatigue of a day spent trembling in fear.

"Ugh, the smell! What are you doing all of a sudden? I told you to wash up first!"

"Wait just a little, Yuna. Your brother will definitely become the ruler of the harbor."

"Tch! Still talking about that? What's a ruler of the harbor anyway? Even if you become one, who would recognize it?"

"Haha! That's true."

Yuna giggled and nestled into Gis's embrace. Actually, she didn't mind the sweat smell. Not a single drop of sweat hadn't been shed for her sake.

"I hope that day really comes. Brother can definitely do it."

"Yeah..."

Gis looked at the moonlight streaming through the window. It was perfect weather for enjoying the night.

**Ancient Ruins (1)**

Shirone's group was busy from dawn. While the girls washed, the boys cleaned the house, and when the boys went to the bathhouse, the girls sat in front of mirrors drying their hair and getting ready.

When Shirone and Rian came out after finishing their baths, they looked into the girls' room and thought time had stopped. Amy and Tess were still doing something in front of the mirror.

Having no choice, the boys ate breakfast first. As they were finishing a simple meal with food bought in town the night before, dawn broke.

Only then did the girls start choosing clothes, and each time they went in and out of the door, their outfits had completely changed.

Rian thought Tess and Amy were testing him.

He could accept that they changed clothes because they didn't like what they were wearing - fine, they were girls, so that could happen.

But clearly changing clothes because they didn't like something, then coming out wearing the same thing again shortly after - what was that about? Were they really trying to challenge him? Wasn't this an obvious test of the observer's memory?

"Ah, just wear anything. Are we going to catch a dragon? Why are you so concerned about fabric scraps with no defense value?"

Tess looked at Rian with eyes full of shock.

"Ugh, really low-class! It's because you guys don't care about your appearance that we have to dress up more. We're doing it all for your sake, so shut up."

Amy came out wearing a sky-blue dress.

"Shirone, this doesn't look strange, does it?"

"No, it's pretty! Amy looks good in anything she wears."

"Really? Hmm."

Amy didn't particularly listen and returned to her room. Tess could only envy such Amy.

"Please learn from Shirone. Ugh, so annoying."

When Tess closed the door and went inside, Rian pouted. What exactly had he done wrong for her to act like that? Speaking his honest thoughts was a virtue and pride of swordsmen.

"Shirone, how do words like that come to you so quickly? Teach me too."

"Huh? It's simple. I can't say anything looks strange no matter what they wear."

"Uhahahaha!"

Rian fell backward clutching his stomach.

11 AM.

The girls who had changed clothes checked their backpacks. They carefully packed emergency food, knives, compasses, and rope in case of unexpected situations.

Tess, satisfied looking in the mirror, clenched her fist and shouted.

"Done! Ruins exploration preparation complete!"

"Then should we sleep now? Let's definitely leave tomorrow morning."

Tess's face reddened at Rian's pointed joke.

"How late was I really? And Amy was preparing together too."

"Why are you suddenly bringing up Amy? Is Amy some kind of hostage?"

"Look who's talking - do you think your shabby casual clothes and crude greatsword look good together? From a distance, you look like a complete caveman! You should know your place."

Amy fulfilled her duty as a hostage.

"Rian, I'm sorry. Actually, I was the one who was late. Tess prepared faster than me."

"Haha! It's fine. Amy shows that she took time preparing."

Tess's eyes became fierce like an axe.

"What? So you're saying I'm not pretty at all?"

"Hmm, let's see..."

Rian looked Tess up and down.

Well, he had always thought she was pretty. Even without dressing up, she was beautiful.

But today she seemed to have really put in effort. Unlike usual, she had even put on perfume, so even Rian, who lacked aesthetic sense, could tell how much she had tried.

"Yeah, well. Pretty enough to compliment, I suppose."

"Huh?"

Tess's mind, which had been piling up mountains of retorts, was instantly disarmed.

She had never dreamed that the word "pretty" would come from Rian's mouth. Her face turned red, and she turned even redder at the fact that her face had turned red.

"I-I didn't dress up wanting to hear that! You idiot! Caveman!"

"Right. I got it, so please let's get out of here. If the sun sets, we won't be able to see anything."

Rian herded his friends outside. Thus, Shirone's group was able to depart on their trip five hours after waking up.

Shirone's original plan was to investigate the ruins alone with Amy. But as his friends became closer than expected, it became impossible to move separately.

They grabbed any carriage lined up on the beach and headed east.

Since they had to go from the western end of the island to the eastern end, it was quite an arduous journey. However, the four people chatting in the carriage lost track of time.

"Hey? Guys, look over there!"

Shirone shouted, pointing outside the window. Two kilometers from the road, a mountain forming a dense forest could be seen.

The mountain range continued like a camel's hump, and from what he had heard, the Kergo Ruins were located at the end of that mountain range.

"That's Mount Toa. I heard from my brother that Galliant was originally a volcanic island. Lava that seeped from the ocean floor hardened to form the island. After a volcanic eruption 500 years ago, it's now in a dormant period, but there's still plenty of possibility it could become active again."

"I see. I heard that the Kergo Ruins are also buried in volcanic ash, so only half of them are visible."

"Right. The Galliant autonomous government proposed restoring the ruins, but it was scrapped due to opposition from the indigenous people. We'll probably be able to see how buried they are when we get to the ruins."

"Why did they oppose it? From the indigenous people's perspective, wouldn't it be good if they restored the ruins?"

"I don't know that either. But they must have their reasons. Maybe there are secrets they don't want revealed. The Galliant autonomous government has only been on the island for less than 100 years."

"Thinking about it that way, there are quite a few secrets. It really isn't just an ordinary tourist spot."

"That's probably right. Among existing ruins, places directly managed by indigenous people are extremely rare. The Kergo Ruins have high historical value too."

Based on Amy's explanation, Shirone examined the mountain again.

The jungle of Mount Toa belonged solely to the Kergo people. Even the Galliant government didn't approach the indigenous autonomous zone.

Shirone suddenly felt an eerie sensation. Was the feeling of wild eyes from deep in the mountain just his imagination?

The carriage stopped one kilometer from the Kergo Ruins site. The coachman informed them that carriages couldn't operate beyond this point.

Shirone got off the carriage and looked around. He could see numerous shops. There seemed to be an exclusive agreement between the carriage association and local merchant association.

"What! I paid my own money for this carriage, so why can't we go? Then what about all this luggage?"

A middle-aged man with a protruding belly who arrived in the following carriage got angry at the coachman. His wife and two daughters who got off the carriage also looked dissatisfied.

"But that's how the transport company contract works. There's a paid storage facility for luggage, so you can leave it there."

"These highway robbers! The road is wide open like that, but you can't go? Do you think I'll spend a single penny here?"

"There's nothing we can do about it. Sorry. Well then, have a good trip."

The coachman, as if this wasn't his first or second time dealing with this, responded with a businesslike attitude and drove away with his horses.

In the end, the middle-aged man headed to the paid storage facility carrying luggage in both hands. But when his daughters pointed to a snack shop, he put down his luggage and bought them treats.

Shirone felt the middle-aged man's situation wasn't someone else's problem.

"If we had known in advance, we could have reduced our luggage."

"Doesn't it not matter? There doesn't seem to be any major danger at tourist sites, but it's still better to be well prepared. After all, exploration is our purpose."

Rian looked back at the departing middle-aged man. His mood seemed to have improved from his daughters' charm as he was laughing heartily while heading toward the ruins.

"He's kind of shameless, but he was smart. As tourists, they can't avoid spending money."

"That's true, but you can't just see it as commercialism. If tourist commercial districts aren't activated, the indigenous people can't manage them either."

Agreeing with Amy's words, Shirone's group began moving on foot.

Since it was said to be an important historical treasure, there were indeed many tourists. The closer they got to the ruins, the more the numbers grew, and when they reached the toll booth, it created a massive crowd due to bottlenecking.

"Wow, do you see that? There are people from other countries too."

"It's a world-famous place. Do you see that man standing at the arch? I think he's probably indigenous."

Shirone looked where Amy was pointing. A medium-height man was guarding the entrance. His clothing was civilized, but his eyes staring straight ahead were definitely those of the wild.

Tess showed an unusually frightened expression.

"Ugh, he looks scary. He even has tattoos on his face?"
