"Yeah. They actually look strong too."

"Right."

Shirone and Amy agreed. It wasn't simply because of the tattoos. Their keen senses were picking up on the actual latent force emanating from the man.

But Rian's thoughts were different.

"Hmph, putting on a tough look doesn't create strength that wasn't there before. No need to be scared."

Rian's senses were duller than others. That's why he couldn't open Schema, but Shirone actually found reassurance in that attitude. No matter what frightening situation arose, Rian would stubbornly become a shield for his friends.

"Alright! Let the ruins exploration begin!"

After passing through the toll booth, the real investigation started.

The Kergo Ruins were a temple that once served gods, forming a square structure two kilometers east to west and two kilometers north to south.

Crossing the 200-meter moat via a bridge led to long corridors, and only after walking another 500 meters along the pilgrimage path could one reach the central temple.

"Wow, it's really huge. This building was really constructed thousands of years ago?"

"I heard from people earlier that this is how it looks after being buried in volcanic ash—it was actually several times larger originally."

Shirone looked down at his feet. Since the volcanic eruption was 500 years ago, the volcanic ash would have formed below the surface layer.

Amy, who was walking ahead, turned around and shouted to Shirone.

"Shirone, what are you doing? We need to look around the central temple too."

Shirone didn't respond. He was just wearing a faint smile and concentrating on something.

Puzzled, Amy approached Shirone.

"What's wrong? What's going on?"

"Amy, try entering Spirit Zone."

"Spirit Zone? Why the zone all of a sudden?"

Amy realized something and slapped her palm down.

"Ah, I see!"

Mages could extend their senses through Spirit Zone. If something was hidden beneath the ruins, it couldn't escape synesthetic detection.

"Got it. I'll try."

Amy entered Spirit Zone. As she explored underground with synesthesia, her brow gradually furrowed. After about five seconds, she seemed to realize something and released the zone.

"Shirone, this is..."

"Yeah. Nothing's registering. There should at least be bedrock, but there's nothing at all."

"Maybe it's because the volcanic ash layer is thick? What if we go really deep?"

That was exactly why they were struggling—they couldn't do that. But after thinking for a moment, Shirone caught on and shouted.

"Aha, there is such a method!"

Amy could do it. Her specialty was the target-type among the four-way types, which had long range.

The target-type was also called the cross zone, where the mage positioned themselves at the intersection of two lines and rapidly rotated it to quickly hit specific targets.

But that wasn't the end of it.

Amy, who had entered the graduating class, had developed the target-type into sniper mode when choosing her major.

Sniper mode, where the Spirit Zone formed a perfect straight line, was characterized by the mage positioning themselves at the end of the zone to enhance range.

This form was called a directional zone. While it had the disadvantage of slower zone rotation, it could achieve at least four times the range of target-type.

If the zone radius was expanded to just 500 meters in diameter, it would exceed one kilometer in target-type. Switching to sniper mode from there would allow striking targets up to four kilometers away.

Amy's current basic radius was 68 meters in diameter. Converting to target-type made it 143 meters, and entering sniper mode exceeded 500 meters.

"Alright, I'll try."

Amy entered zone simultaneously with sequence magic. The four-way transformation occurred at high speed as the axis stood upright as a cross tilted 90 degrees.

'Sniper mode!'

Amy's zone began boring downward like a torrent. Groaning sounds leaked between her clenched teeth.

As the zone lengthened, its durability inevitably weakened. While it wouldn't be a problem without obstacles, not knowing what lay underground, the zone couldn't find its direction and was bending this way and that.

Amy penetrated more desperately.

The moment she thought she had touched something for the first time, the zone shattered and her consciousness wavered.

"Gasp! Gasp!"

"Amy! Are you okay?"

Shirone hurriedly supported Amy. Cold sweat was beading on her forehead.

"I'm fine. This is going to be tough though. I penetrated up to 300 meters, but beyond that is impossible. From there it's like throwing thread into an ocean—it just floats around."

Shirone could imagine how powerful the forces at work were. Amy's zone was by no means weak in durability. Yet she was comparing her zone to fragile thread.

"Still, you found out that something exists there. That alone is amazing."

"I suppose it's progress if anything. But that's not enough. Someone who can expand their zone while maintaining durability. Unless they're at least a master-level zoner, exploration with Spirit Zone would be impossible."

Even to Shirone's perception, unless someone was at that level, exploring underground in the ruins seemed unthinkable.

"If I'd known this would happen, I would have asked brother Ares. His expedition team probably has zoners capable of exploring this place."

"Or we could ask Teacher Ethela."

Ethela was a zoner specialized in durability, befitting a monk. She was the perfect person for exploring this type of terrain.

"Teacher Ethela might be able to do it. I don't know how deep it goes, but she could easily break through to where I reached."

Rian interjected.

"But if that's the case, we wouldn't need to investigate ourselves, right? I heard the principal gave you a hint. Didn't his words also contain the meaning that we should figure it out ourselves?"

Shirone and Amy looked at each other and fell silent. When focusing only on efficiency, they sometimes forgot the meaning like this.

Amy honestly admitted.

"Rian's right. But it's such a waste. If we could just break through here, we wouldn't need to investigate the ruins. How about we keep thinking in this direction instead?"

Shirone understood Amy's feelings. They had come on this trip to find clues about the labyrinth, not to play at exploration in the ruins.

"Let's try various approaches for now. It's not something we can do right away anyway. Now I'm even more curious. I think I'll only be satisfied once I see it with my own eyes."

Leaving only vague imagination about what lay underground, Shirone's group continued their exploration.

But the Kergo Ruins really were just an ordinary tourist site.

As if mocking their serious investigation, middle-aged men were chatting and children were running around spinning pinwheels.

"Amy, we are working hard, right?"

"Don't ask. I'm feeling self-loathing right now too."

After looking around the final route, the central temple, the group finally stopped their investigation. They couldn't find anything unusual in the surface ruins.

"I don't understand. The principal said we'd know if we came here. But what does a ruins from thousands of years ago have to do with the labyrinth?"

"Anyway, there's definitely something underground. I guess we have no choice but to explore with Spirit Zone after all?"

Rian's eyes lit up as if something had occurred to him.

"I have a good idea. If we can't break through with Spirit Zone, how about we just dig directly into the ground? Something should come up eventually, right?"

Shirone and Amy looked at Rian as if he was absurd, then continued their conversation.

"How about contacting the natives? Since they live with the locals, there should be people who can speak the common language."

"Hmm, right. But I don't think such people would know anything important. Rather, an interpreter..."

Rian shouted indignantly.

"Hey! Why aren't you responding to me? I said let's dig!"

Tess interjected.

"You fool, it's a ruins that even the autonomous government can't touch—how are you going to stick a shovel in there? If you did such a thing, you'd receive a heavy sentence for cultural heritage destruction."

After scolding Rian, she looked at Shirone.

"What are you going to do now?"

"I don't know. Inquiry would be best, but that seems difficult right now too. We need to find an interpreter and get permits to enter the indigenous autonomous district."

"Really? Then I have one method we could try right away—want to hear it?"

"Oh, really? Tell us! What is it?"

Rian, as if he couldn't be the only one embarrassed, made a sulky expression and said.

"Don't tell me you're suggesting we secretly dig the ground?"

Tess desperately suppressed her anger and continued.

"...Anyway. The method I thought of is this. While you were focusing on the ruins, I looked around elsewhere. And there's one peculiar thing."

"Peculiar thing? What's that?"

Tess swept the surrounding scenery with her gaze.

"Look at the people carefully. Most are tourists, but occasionally there are those who aren't. They move in groups, are armed, and aren't particularly interested in the ruins."

The three looked around. It was definitely true. There weren't many, but armed people were certainly walking around.

"Aha! I see!"

"Right, they're mercenaries. Why would mercenaries be wandering around a tourist attraction? Some of them look quite strong too. In the end, there's something in these ruins."

"And the mercenaries know about it?"

"Exactly. Contact with natives would take time anyway, and they might not tell us anything. But mercenaries are different. The very fact that they entered this place means they know something."

Shirone was impressed by Tess's perceptiveness. While others were concentrating on the ruins, she alone had been observing the external situation.

Knowing Tess's background, it was natural. The Elzaine family had historically produced numerous commanders and diplomats. But their true power lay elsewhere.

Spies, precisely.

Of course, from enemy nations' perspective they were spies, but the information sent from agents infiltrating countries around the world made enormous contributions to the Tormia Kingdom's diplomatic strategy.

'It's definitely a good idea. No, it's the only idea we have right now.'

Shirone decided to adopt Tess's strategy.

"Good. So now we just need to tail the mercenaries?"

"Tail them? Hmm, honestly I'm not confident. If skilled mercenaries catch us, it becomes troublesome. Especially if they have sensory Schema—we'd definitely be caught. If I tailed them alone, I could manage somehow."

"That's a problem. I don't even know how to hide my presence. So what do we do?"

"Hehe, do we really need to seek them out? For mercenaries, there's a place where they're everywhere, right?"

"Huh? There's such a place? Where?"

Tess winked and pointed somewhere.

"Want to have a drink in broad daylight?"

* * *

On the southwest inner wall of the ruins site, various shops made of makeshift shacks lined up.

There were restaurants, bars, and grocery stores in that order. Though modest in scale compared to regular shops, business was much better.

Being inside the ruins site and with high prices, people still visited for the single advantage of convenience.

Shirone's group entered a bar. They wondered how many people would be drinking in broad daylight, but except for two tables, all seats were occupied.

Shirone's group chose a corner. Amy sat next to Shirone, while Rian and Tess sat across from them.

"Are you going to drink alcohol?"

"We probably should order some, right? Since it's a place that sells alcohol. But let's focus on appetizers. It'd be better to have lunch here."

Tess placed the order. Traditional liquor from Galliant Island came with hot noodles and minced meat.

The four, who had eaten poorly for breakfast, temporarily stopped talking and focused on eating.

At that moment, giggling laughter came from nearby. At first they tried not to pay attention, but as the annoying mocking laughter continued, they couldn't help but feel irritated.
