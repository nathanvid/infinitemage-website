"Those bastards are definitely laughing while looking at us, right?"

"Forget it. Don't turn your head. They're just drunk and acting up."

Tess patted Rian's leg to calm him down. While mercenaries fighting in taverns was common enough, given their profession, things rarely ended well.

"Those guys still aren't reacting. It can't be that they don't hear us. We're laughing at you, you idiots."

"Look at that guy's sword. It's ridiculously huge, isn't it? The woman next to him is no joke in size either. I won't say where exactly. Hahaha!"

Rian clenched his fists. He could tolerate insults directed at himself, but he couldn't forgive mockery of his friends.

Then Tess grabbed Rian's wrist. If left alone, he looked ready to flip the table at any moment.

Shirone ate his noodles while searching his memory.

When they had entered, he'd seen four mercenaries sitting at that table. Three men and one woman. There seemed to be an archer among them, and since the woman had no visible weapon, she was likely a mage.

'An archer and a mage. Quite a solid group.'

The mercenaries' mockery continued without pause.

"That blonde kid is now pretending to eat? Please, just turn around once. I'm ready to throw a bottle. I'm in a really foul mood today. That's why I'm looking to see some blood."

"Oh, stop it. Is it fun picking on kids?"

The woman tried to stop them, but there was no sincerity in her words. It seemed she preferred enjoying things this way rather than openly mocking them.

"Hey, little brats. Don't you have the courage to fight? Aren't you ashamed in front of the women? Those guys probably went around bragging about how incredibly strong they are."

"Hello? Can you hear me? If you can hear me, please respond, or should I come over there directly?"

Rian couldn't contain his anger. He knew it was part of their strategy, but he didn't want to endure such humiliation.

But Rian ultimately couldn't move. He met eyes with Shirone, who was looking at him with a calm expression.

'Shirone...'

Shirone, bound by the knight's oath, wasn't saying anything. If he couldn't endure even this level of humiliation, it would only bring shame to Shirone's face.

'Right, this is also training. I participated in this journey as an apprentice knight. I've actually gotten a good opportunity to test myself.'

Once he steeled his resolve, it became surprisingly bearable. Rian could think once more about the meaninglessness of words.

After about ten minutes, the mercenaries prepared to leave. They thought they had achieved a complete victory. These greenhorns had been perfect entertainment for their drinking session.

"Hehe, I've never seen such pathetic guys in my entire life."

"Oh, enough. They're weak kids, so naturally they were scared. Don't you feel sorry for them?"

"Hey! You guys are lucky. You don't have to get beaten up. Live like that for the rest of your lives. You'll live long."

The mercenaries paid for their drinks and disappeared. Then the tavern owner, who had been playing ignorant until now, rushed to their table.

"Are you guys okay? Those absolute scoundrels. Hurling abuse at innocent kids like that."

"Do you know those people?"

"They've been coming frequently lately. They get drunk and cause trouble with people like you who don't want to fight. I'd like to tell them not to come, but then who knows what kind of harm they might do. Anyway, you endured it well. In times like these, enduring is winning."

Shirone's eyes lit up. Unless there was something at the ruins site, a party with a mage wouldn't have any reason to visit.

Tess comforted Rian. Unlike Shirone, these straightforward guys didn't have the ability to deceive even themselves. They had truly endured through sheer grit.

"Well done, Rian. I was so worried you might cause trouble."

"It was dangerous. But we're going to meet them again anyway, right? That's why you endured it, isn't it?"

"Right. Let's head out too."

Shirone stood up from his seat as he spoke. When they paid for their drinks and left the tavern, the mercenaries were walking toward the central temple.

Shirone's group chose surveillance from high ground instead of tailing them. Since most archer schema builds were sensory-based, there was a high chance of being discovered if they closed the distance.

Climbing to the fourth floor of a temple building, Shirone observed the mercenaries. Surprisingly, it was a young party composed of members who didn't look older than thirty.

A lean-built swordsman seemed to be the leader. The sword at his waist was an iron blade famous enough that Tess could recall the craftsman's name just from the design.

Next to him was a giant wielding a blunt weapon, and in the rear followed a long-haired man and a woman in robes.

"Two warriors. One of them is a swordsman. One archer, one mage. That's how we can categorize them. Even though this is a tourist spot, they're maintaining formation. It's a party with lots of real combat experience. It seems we made the right decision not to tail them."

The mercenaries walked toward the stepped altar on the east side of the central temple. Shirone remembered that place. He had found it curious that it was uniquely guarded by a native.

Among the mercenaries who approached the native, the archer spoke with hand gestures mixed in. He seemed to know the Kergo language.

The native looked around stoically. He was clearly concerned about people's attention. Shirone's group realized this was the right moment and went down the stairs.

When the native activated the mechanism, a rectangular crack appeared in the altar and sank inward. The thick stone door moved sideways, revealing an entrance shrouded in a wall of darkness.

"Wait! We want to go in too!"

The mercenaries who were about to move turned around with hardened expressions. But their tension quickly disappeared, replaced by irritation. The greenhorns they had tormented in the tavern were running toward them.

"What? When did you guys follow us?"

"Mister, can't we go in together?"

"Get lost! We're the ones who found this place! Do you even know where this is?"

"Come on, just let us..."

The moment Shirone pleaded again, the leader drew his sword. While his drawing speed couldn't be called fast, the naturalness that came from countless repetitions was outstanding.

"Do you want to die? Do we look easy to you? If you don't get lost, I'll cut all your throats right here."

Unlike before, Shirone didn't back down. While he couldn't even turn his head in the tavern, now he was looking directly into their eyes. That contrast effect made the leader feel unpleasant.

"These bastards...!"

The native guarding the altar spoke.

"Are you companions?"

The leader withdrew his killing intent and looked back at the archer. Only the archer could translate.

"What's this guy saying?"

"He's asking if we're companions."

"Hmph! Companions my ass. I'll deal with this now, so tell him to wait."

When the archer conveyed the leader's words, the native's eyes widened. Like someone who had been insulted, he spoke in a commanding tone, filled with rising anger.

"A warrior does not fight just anywhere. Anyone who defiles the sacred altar with blood can never set foot in this place."

The archer clicked his tongue as he translated.

"I think we should stop. He says if we fight here, he won't let us in."

"Tch! Lucky little brats. You've saved your lives twice now."

The leader, as if he didn't want to deal with it anymore, sheathed his sword and entered the altar. Then the other companions followed into the dark entrance.

Shirone's group waited for a moment. If they had entered together, there would have been no problem, but with the situation as it was, the native's sharp gaze was concerning.

"If you wish to be tested, come in. The angel's eyes will watch over you."

"What's this person saying?"

"Well, seems like he's telling us to relax and enjoy ourselves since we're here? If he meant to chase us away, he would have closed the door."

Shirone moved cautiously. There was no particular reaction from the native. Only then did the four people, now confident, enter the entrance dark as an abyss.

Eight people disappeared in an instant, but no tourist knew this fact.

**Labyrinth of Space and Time (1)**

Entering the altar, Shirone first examined the structure. Unlike what it looked like from outside, torches were lit inside, so it wasn't dark.

A square hole descended underground, with stairs spiraling down at right angles along the inner walls.

Looking down, he could see the mercenary party that had already gone around the spiral twice.

Shirone quickened his pace. There might be a second checkpoint, so it wasn't good to distance themselves from the mercenaries.

Eventually, all eight people formed a group going down the stairs.

The leader was annoyed by the greenhorns who had freeloaded on information he'd paid a fortune for.

But achieving their purpose for coming here was the priority, so he set aside thoughts of fighting for now.

The archer at the rear of the mercenary party asked Shirone, who was following behind.

"Are you guys in your right minds? Why are kids whose heads aren't even dry yet wandering around places like this?"

"Then why did you come here, hyung?"

"What, don't tell me you followed us without knowing anything?"

"Yeah. We don't know."

The archer looked at Shirone as if dumbfounded. He thought it might actually be possible. The existence of hidden doors in ruins sites was an open secret.

Something exists underground in the ruins site. But what that is, nobody knows. This was the limit of what ordinary people interested in ruins sites could think.

"Since we're already in, can't you tell us? Why did you come to this place?"

The archer pondered what to do. He had run around the information market until his feet were sore looking for the hidden door.

Moreover, the password was high-grade information that cost a hefty 20 gold.

But now that they'd passed through the door, the information's value was essentially lost.

Thinking that far, the archer's eyes lit up as he spoke.

"How about this? The fact that you guys entered the door means you broke through a high-security password. In monetary terms, that's worth at least 100 gold. So here's what I'm thinking - I'll sell you information. 5 gold per question. How about it?"

"That's okay. We'll find out when we go down anyway."

When Shirone spoke as if there was no need to think about it, the archer got heated. Beyond making money or not, he felt mocked by a kid.

'This damn impudent brat...!'

At that moment, the leader stopped walking. When the front stopped, the people following behind slowed down in order.

"No, listening to this, that sounds good. Do you know how much trouble we went through to find this place? You can't just swallow that for free. If you want to go down here, pay us money."

Shirone looked back at Amy. When she shrugged her shoulders, he nodded as if he understood and said to the leader.

"Then we won't go down. We'll stay here, so you go down and handle your business."

"You little...!"

The leader got worked up without realizing it.

He should have realized it in the tavern when they couldn't even turn their heads. This was probably what people meant when they said scrawny things were all mouth.

"But if it's 1 gold per question, I'd be willing to make a deal."

"Huh? 1 gold?"

The leader's mind raced. They couldn't recover their investment from these guys anyway. Then wouldn't it be profitable to earn even a few gold?

"Fine. It's 1 gold per question. Pay 1 gold first."

Shirone rummaged through his coin purse and pulled out 1 gold. While they could have investigated separately from the mercenaries, his friends respected Shirone's judgment.

Shirone thought this situation was worth 1 gold. They knew nothing about what might be underground. If they could prepare countermeasures in advance for 1 gold, he thought it definitely wouldn't be a loss.

For example, if there were dangers that only the mercenaries knew about, they would be helplessly caught if those guys set a trap. But after hearing the explanation, they could roughly predict the underground danger level and exploration difficulty.

"Why did you come to this place?"

Since overly broad questions could give room for making things up, Shirone dug into the essential parts.
