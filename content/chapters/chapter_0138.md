However, the leader wasn't an easy opponent either.

"We came to meet the natives. There, satisfied?"

"That could be an answer, but you need to explain. This is a breach of contract. If it's going to be like this, I won't ask any more questions."

The leader realized his mistake. He had been so focused on teasing Shirone that he'd closed shop too early.

The quick-witted female mage added an explanation.

"We don't know anything else either. Because we really did just come to meet the natives."

"I see."

Shirone looked back at his friends and nodded. If they didn't know what was underground either, at least the risk of falling into a trap was eliminated.

Thinking it was a decent deal, Shirone pulled out another gold coin.

"Why did you come to meet the natives? Here's 1 gold."

The archer who received the money smacked his lips as if conflicted. Honestly, it was an embarrassing story to reveal to others.

"To get Loop. It circulates in the market too, but here we can buy it in large quantities at much cheaper prices. We plan to sell it to raise capital for adventures. There, does that answer it?"

Shirone was momentarily shocked. This was a place for Loop smuggling, completely unrelated to the ruins' secrets.

However, since the mercenaries had also come here with only fragmentary information, it was too early to make definitive judgments.

'What's going on here? This is completely different from what I expected. A place that sells drugs? No, I shouldn't think of it that way. It may be a drug to ordinary people, but to the natives it's a ritual tool. Therefore, it must be something they hold sacred. Which means in the end...'

Having finished his thoughts, Shirone asked:

"By any chance, isn't this place a passage connected to the native autonomous zone?"

"What? How do you know that... Oh no!"

The archer who realized his mistake frowned. He had answered without even receiving money.

Then Shirone rummaged through his pocket and pulled out 1 gold. He had asked urgently, but he had no intention of using trickery.

"Ah, here's 1 gold. Sorry for asking first."

The archer stared at Shirone's outstretched hand.

Of course, 1 gold wasn't easy money to earn, but for a mercenary with some experience, it wasn't an amount to tremble over.

"Tch! Forget it. I made the mistake."

"It's not a mistake. That's how contracts work."

"I know! I just can't accept it because my pride is hurt. Damn, I can't believe I made such a mistake. I still have a long way to go."

"Then I'll consider the last question a free service."

Shirone put the gold coin back without regret. If he wouldn't accept it, forcing unnecessary waste wouldn't be the proper attitude of a sound student.

The archer felt irritated for no reason. At some point, he felt like he was being manipulated by a kid no bigger than a chestnut.

"Instead, let me ask you one thing. How did you figure it out? Actually, that information is top secret."

"Because Loop is a sacred item to the natives. Moreover, if the profit margin is huge enough to raise big money by selling Loop, it wouldn't be distributed carelessly either. In the end, you'd need permission from someone with authority among the natives, and the only place where such a person would be is naturally the autonomous zone."

The archer was left speechless. He had discovered the Kergo Ruins while wondering if there was any profitable work to be done.

The conclusion he had reached only after staying up several nights investigating Loop and scouring the information market was completely contained in Shirone's brief words.

"Tch! You're wickedly clever. Any more questions?"

"No, I don't. Now let's go down and check it out."

The archer smiled bitterly. He guessed the reason Shirone wasn't asking more questions. Probably because he realized that no matter what he asked, there was nothing more to tell.

Shirone's group descended for 20 minutes from there. Although they spiraled down, it was still an incredible depth.

When they reached the end of the stairs, a single-path corridor continued. Two natives stood at an iron gate installed 10 meters ahead.

Unlike the natives outside, they had their upper bodies exposed and their bare feet showed below their pants.

Tattoos starting from their navels branched upward, extending all the way to their faces, looking terrifying even from a distance.

Shirone thought that place probably wasn't the autonomous district. They would have to walk at least several kilometers to enter the jungle of Mount Toa.

The mercenaries also showed obvious signs of tension. The archer in charge of translation moved to position next to the leader.

After exchanging a few coded words in the Kergo language, the native pulled a switch.

Iron wheels turned as the gate opened left and right.

"Wow..."

Shirone's eyes sparkled as if he had fallen into a strange world.

It was an octagonal room crafted with stone walls. An iron gate was visible on the opposite side of the entrance, with three men guarding it.

In the center, a flat octagonal altar matching the room's shape was laid out, with spheres about 30 centimeters in diameter floating above each of the eight corners.

Shirone recalled a memory. He had definitely seen those spheres somewhere before.

"Huh, those are?"

The archer looked back at Shirone with curiosity. The probability of recognizing something here was extremely slim, considering he claimed not to know what was here until coming.

"What's wrong? Do you know what those are?"

"Those are definitely from the Labyrinth..."

The leader smacked his lips.

"Hmph, who are you to act like you know? What, did they remind you of the twin orbs hanging below?"

The leader had disliked Shirone since the tavern. He despised people who had no courage to fight but strutted around in front of women. Because he had no woman to strut in front of.

"Labyrinth? Did you just say labyrinth?"

The native guarding the entrance asked. Even Shirone, who didn't know the language, could understand the word "labyrinth."

The archer, curious about the situation, added translation like he was doing a favor.

"He's asking if you know the labyrinth."

"Yes. I've encountered it once before."

When the archer said so, the native's eyes contorted. The tattoos twisted, making him look like a legendary demon.

"Encountered it? That cannot be. That is a lie."

"No, it's not. I really did encounter it."

The native fell into deep thought. But as if he had reached a simple conclusion, he quickly returned to a relieved expression.

"I judge nothing. Only the angel's eyes will watch over you."

Leaving incomprehensible words, he closed the iron gate, so Shirone also gave up his regret and turned around. He thought this was just the beginning anyway.

As the mercenaries walked toward the center, one native approached from the opposite iron gate.

It seemed that two of the three natives were gatekeepers, and only the man now approaching had a different role.

You could tell just from the tattoo colors. While ordinary Kergo people had red tattoos, this man's tattoos were white.

"This is the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice. The angel's eight eyes will judge you. To enter Kergo, you must pass through the Labyrinth of Time and Space."

Hearing the word "labyrinth," Shirone quickly turned his head. But the archer seemed to have no intention of translating anymore and kept his mouth shut.

"Labyrinth? He just said labyrinth, didn't he? What is that person saying?"

"Hey, don't get the wrong idea. I'm not your interpreter, so why should I teach you everything?"

"You're going to tell your companions anyway. Tell me quickly."

"No way. Let's not bother with each other from now on. We came here because we have business to do too."

The man with white tattoos crossed his arms and stared at them intently. Just from their gestures, he could tell Shirone was requesting translation.

"Is there one among you who has learned the ancient language?"

"Ah, I know a little."

"Then translate. Opportunity is fair to everyone. The angel's eyes watch everything in the Labyrinth of Time and Space."

"Why should I do that? These guys aren't part of our group. I don't know what you mean by judging, but please separate us."

"No. From the moment you entered the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice, you are one. Will you achieve or will you sacrifice? That is all you can choose."

"Damn! What bad luck. What am I supposed to do with these brats?"

As the conversation dragged on, the mage pressed him.

"What the hell is he saying? Hurry up and tell us."

Having no choice, the archer relayed what he had heard so far.

The mercenaries who heard the whole story were annoyed. If they had known this would happen, they should have somehow shaken off Shirone's group before coming.

"The angel's eyes will judge? Does that mean they'll evaluate our skills? And all together with those brats? Isn't this too disadvantageous for us?"

When the mage complained, Amy's eyes narrowed.

"Hey, you keep calling us brats, but how do you know whether we have skills or not?"

"Ho ho ho! Oh, really? Not content with freeloading, you're thinking of clinging to us? Let me be clear - if you mess up our work, you'd better be prepared."

"Hmph! Do whatever you want. We had no intention of working with you anyway."

The mage smiled coldly. Who was she? She was one of the rising stars among rookie mages receiving attention in the mercenary world.

She didn't associate with inferior mercenaries at all, which is why her companions were also assembled from those of similar age and matching level.

On the other hand, those naive kids were clearly students who had learned some swordsmanship and magic somewhere.

What you learned in school and actual combat were worlds apart. Among mercenaries who had to risk their lives easily, especially those evaluated as rising stars, she could confidently say her skills wouldn't lose even when compared to certified mages.

'Hmph, just wait and see, brats. Once we get past here, I'll make you cry and beg.'

Anyway, thanks to the women's power struggle, the petty emotions could be buried.

As the eight people waited for what came next, the man with white tattoos began his explanation.

"There are two conditions to pass the gateway. Prove your ability, or send one person through the sacrifice of one person."

As soon as he heard the translation, Shirone threw out a question.

"What does proving mean? Specifically, what kind of thing do we prove?"

"Hey! Stop butting in! I won't translate for you!"

"You said we have to do this together. Just hurry up and ask."

Having nothing to say, the archer ground his teeth and translated. The white man nodded and added more.

"Descendant of warriors, step onto the judgment altar and display your specialty to one of the eight orbs. The divine language will answer. If a red light rises, you fail. If a white light rises, you pass."

Shirone continued to pour out questions. It was as if he had hired the archer as a personal interpreter.

"Is there a limit to the number of attempts? For instance, can one person try multiple times?"

"You may do so until your strength is exhausted. If a passer appears, everyone can go to Kergo. If not a single person passes, you must return. This is the will of the labyrinth and the mission of the Kergo people."

"You mentioned achievement and sacrifice. So what is sacrifice?"

"With one person's blood, one person can pass."

"Do you mean they have to die?"

"Yes."

Having heard that far, Shirone fell into thought. They could challenge as many times as they wanted, and if just one person succeeded, everyone could pass.

But what if no one passed? They would have no choice but to pass through the gate with a companion's sacrifice. And it would be one life per person.

'Something's strange. Is there really a need to go to Kergo by doing such cruel things? Killing companions just to get Loop doesn't make sense. There must be something more in Kergo. In the end, the mercenaries came here without knowing the real secret underground either.'

Shirone gestured for translation again. Since the information gathered so far had been useful, the archer agreed without complaint.

"Are there restrictions on sacrifice? I mean, like bringing someone else from outside, or using a corpse of someone already dead."

"No. From the moment you entered the room, you are one. The door will never open until everyone agrees. Therefore, such questions are meaningless."
