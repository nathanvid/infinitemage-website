Shirone realized the situation. The rules were more restrictive and dangerous than expected. Unifying multiple opinions into one was far more difficult than he had thought.

He didn't know what was in Kergo, but if there was something worth risking their lives for, there was also the possibility of internal strife.

"What? It was that simple? How about this? We deal with these four brats and go in ourselves. I never knew there was such an easy method."

The leader turned to look at Shirone, his mouth twisting into a grin. His eyes expected to see terror, but Shirone only found him pathetic.

Now that they had heard the rules, cooperation was the right path forward, even if they didn't like it.

A leader who only acted on emotion from the start would not only destroy the organization but also endanger his comrades' lives.

'This person doesn't have the qualifications to be a leader. The others seem at least competent.'

As expected, his comrades stepped in to stop him. Since they could definitely pass if they achieved success, sacrifice was a matter to consider later.

"Enough. Let's get started now. How long are we going to stay here?"

"Tch! Consider yourself lucky, kid."

The man with white tattoos headed to the side of the altar. He crossed his arms at a position where he could see all eight orbs.

"That concludes my explanation. Come out one by one and prove your abilities."

Shirone's group and the mercenary gang exchanged glances with each other. They were calculating who would benefit from going first.

The leader drew his iron sword and pointed it at Shirone.

"Hey, you guys go first. Of course, I don't expect much, but do your best so we can at least get a feel for it. Then who knows? Maybe we'll take you to Kergo."

"I refuse. Why are you deciding that unilaterally?"

"What's that? You know what, I really don't like you! Should I kill you right now? Kill you and go in?"

"You keep causing discord. From now on, we need to unify our opinions. Didn't you hear that if even one person refuses, we can't get out? They said there's no limit to attempts, but handicaps might apply to those who try, and traps like anti-magic might activate. Since we're all beginners, we need to carefully decide the order."

"You, you insolent brat...!"

The leader was on the verge of losing his reason. He hated the way the kid talked back to him, but what annoyed him most was that he couldn't refute it.

However, the female mage thought differently. Of course, there might be no special restrictions, but since they hadn't seen the future, it was better to consider all possible variables.

"That child is right. Let's decide the order. So how should we decide?"

Shirone looked back at the Labyrinth of Time and Space on the altar. Having experienced the phenomenon called Spot, he could roughly predict what kind of situation this was.

"Those orbs can probably absorb near-infinite energy. The standard approach would be to put high-firepower mages at the back and have warriors go first."

"Does it have to be something so violent? What's your reason for being so certain?"

"Because it's the best specialty that descendants of warriors can prove. Moreover, looking at the altar's structure, it has characteristics for implementing something on a fixed target. Therefore, it's reasonable to see it as a device designed for striking."

"I'm convinced. Then let's decide the order. Shall we start with the swordsmen?"

The mage spoke while looking at the leader. However, he shook his head as if offended.

"No, I'll go later. What does that brat know to be spouting off? This is a simple game. You just go out and smash it."

"Sigh, our leader is like this. What do you want to do?"

"It's fine. Then we'll send a swordsman from our side."

Shirone looked at the swordsman on his side. Both Rian and Tess were swordsmen. But he could predict who would go without even looking.

Once the first attempt was over, they could gain considerable information. Since it was such an important and dangerous role, there was no way Rian would send Tess first.

"I'll go first. Of course, it might end with my turn. Hahaha!"

"Your groundless confidence, really. Anyway, be careful. Don't let your guard down."

Receiving Tess's encouragement, Rian stood at the center of the altar and looked around.

It definitely felt different from when he viewed it from outside. It seemed as if all eight orbs in every direction were glaring at him.

"Hey! Hurry up! Are you already scared?"

Rian couldn't even hear the leader's words. From the moment Shirone had designated him, he had been figuring out what he needed to do.

'In other words, I'm the vanguard. I need to obtain all the information I can get on my turn. Right, Shirone?'

Rian walked toward the northern orb. It wasn't as transparent as it had looked from afar. It felt like it was filled with murky fog.

"Hmm, they said there's no limit to attempts, right?"

Rian brought his face close to the orb and tapped it with the back of his hand. When there was no particular reaction, he gradually increased the force and repeated the action.

At some point, the fog in the orb disappeared completely, and the number 1 appeared in the transparent sphere.

"Huh? It's a number?"

Shirone recalled the explanation he had heard from the man with white tattoos.

"Ah, so divine language means numbers. Rian, just in case, step back for now."

Rian calmly stepped back a couple of paces. Shortly after, the orb glowed red and illuminated the hall.

It meant failure.

Everyone wondered what would happen, but that was all. They watched for about three more seconds, but no threatening situation occurred.

"Aha, so white light means passing?"

Understanding the rules, Rian returned to the center of the altar and finally drew his straight sword.

When the true size of the sword, which had been hidden behind Rian's large frame, was revealed, the mercenaries were startled. If that was all iron, it would be impossible to lift without Schema.

"Rian! Hit it with all your might!"

Tess, whose tension had somewhat eased, cheered while rotating her arms. Just learning that no harm would come to those who attempted was a great achievement.

"Don't worry. I'll smash it in one blow."

Rian gripped the sword with both hands and lowered his stance. Embarrassingly, his heart was pounding.

But wasn't this the perfect situation to begin with the sword his grandfather had left him? And with an attack using both hands and his whole heart at that.

"Alright! Here I go!"

Rian charged at full speed and brought the great sword down. Instead of the powerful crash everyone expected, there was a low, dull sound.

The Labyrinth of Time and Space didn't shake, and there was no reaction. It was impossible without absorbing all the force.

"Uuuugh!"

Rian maintained the position of striking down on the Labyrinth of Time and Space. He could clearly feel all the strength in his body being sucked away.

But more than that, he was curious about the number that would appear in the orb. Would it be a pass or fail?

The orb became transparent and revealed the number 241. Compared to the striking force when 1 appeared, it seemed he had done quite well.

But the orb unfortunately emitted red light.

"Ah, so close! Shirone, can't I try just once more?"

Rian was frustrated. At first, he thought it would be fine to just explore, but once he received a failure judgment, his insides boiled as if he had been insulted.

"Are you okay? Your legs seem weak."

"Ah, this? It absorbs all your strength. It doesn't harm the body, so it's not dangerous. I'll recover in a little while."

Shirone nodded at the new information.

"Aha, I see. It's a handicap, but not a serious one. Hmm."

"Anyway, this is really frustrating. If I could just use Schema, I could have passed."

At Rian's words, the warrior from the mercenary gang burst into hearty laughter.

"Puhahaha! You've been acting tough all this time without even being able to use Schema? This is ridiculous. Move aside, I'll do it this time."

When the warrior entered, Rian had no choice but to leave the altar. But even while walking away, he kept muttering "just once more."

"The kid got 241, right? Then I'll aim for about 2,000."

The warrior rolled up his sleeves and swung his main weapon, a flail, through the air. He also had a hand axe at his waist, but based on Rian's attempt, the flail seemed better for delivering impact.

The warrior took a deep breath and enlarged his whole body's muscles. The muscle fibers didn't thicken dramatically, but when such changes occurred throughout his entire body, his size visibly swelled.

"Tess, that person..."

"Right. He's a Schema user. Probably built for strength enhancement. Well, that's a natural choice for a warrior."

"Uaaaah! Here I go!"

The warrior charged with a roar as loud as his size while rapidly rotating the flail with his hands.

Though it wasn't a two-handed weapon, adding rotational force could produce destructive power comparable to one.

The warrior brought down the flail as if killing his greatest enemy.

With a low thud, the motion stopped. Like Rian, the deprivation of strength rendered his entire body powerless.

"Huff! Huff! It's done! It hit properly!"

The warrior stepped back, breathing heavily. Since the technique looked spectacular, the spectators watched with anticipation.

The number 248 appeared.

"What, what? That's impossible! 248? Only 7 points higher than that kid? Is this thing broken?"

Tess took a fencing stance and walked toward the altar.

"You think that's some corner store toy? Hurry up and come down! The red light's already on!"

"No, I can't accept this! Just once, let me try just once more!"

"I get it, so come out! Whether you recover your stamina and challenge again or not, that's up to you!"

The warrior turned around with a frustrated expression. He simply couldn't understand it.

He had never lost when it came to strength since childhood. And even with a strength enhancement build, only 248?

"Huh? Wait a minute."

The warrior looked at Rian with bewilderment. Hadn't that kid said he couldn't use Schema?

But 241 points. That meant he had produced almost the same power as himself just now using only physical strength.

"What, what? That's impossible! You really can't use Schema, right? You lied, didn't you?"

"What's there to brag about lying? If you failed, just quietly watch the next turn."

Rian didn't want to chatter after receiving a failure judgment. What interested him now was how far his friend Tess could go.

Tess stood at the center of the altar and drew her sword. There was a cool sound like sliding over ice. People watched mesmerized by the graceful movement that was like a textbook.

"Hmm, I'll try it, but won't a thin sword be disadvantageous?"

"No, not necessarily. It absorbs all the force. When I struck down with the straight sword, I didn't even feel resistance. The sword probably won't even bend."

"Really? Then shall I try stabbing with all my might?"

"If you're worried, want to use my sword? It's heavy, but you can handle it with Schema, right?"

Tess held up the blade and flicked it with her finger. The thin sword that sprang away vibrated rapidly like a hummingbird's wingbeats.

"No, I'll try it with my swordsmanship. Honestly, this is quite interesting."

Tess walked to the edge of the altar and positioned herself to view the Labyrinth of Time and Space diagonally.

Acceleration of concentration through Schema. There might be no vital points on the orb, but the speed generated by compressing body movements would be entirely converted to force.

Tess charged with a silence more frightening than any battle cry. True to her perfect score on the balance test, she maintained an angle almost parallel to the ground.

The moment she reached the target, her body flickered like an afterimage, and the thin sword that had been skimming the ground rose as if flying.

With perfect thrust motion, the moment she stabbed the orb, there was an illusion of a flash bursting from the sword's tip.

Ordinary swordsmanship reaches maximum acceleration at the midpoint, but Tess's thrust-centered swordsmanship peaks at the sword's "end speed."

When this characteristic was maximized through Schema, it created a thrilling optical illusion.
