Tess had also experienced the power absorption, but without a hint of disruption, she rewound her motion and landed her strike.

The distance control, maximum acceleration—everything was perfect. Everyone's attention focused entirely on the orb.

A number appeared. 442. This was the first time someone had broken 400.

What would the result be? Tess watched intently without showing emotion.

After a moment, the number disappeared and the orb turned red.

"Phew, no good. What a shame."

Tess turned without hesitation. She understood the feelings of the two men who had shouted about trying again, but following their example would be rather undignified behavior.

"Damn it! Isn't that thing actually broken? I stabbed it with a saber—how did it score lower than a blunt weapon?"

The warrior roared in fury. For people who lived by trusting in their brute strength alone, losing to a woman might wound their pride, but from Tess's perspective, it was simply pathetic.

"You both failed anyway, so what's the point of comparing? Besides, building strength and controlling strength are completely different things! Stop just lifting rocks and practice some technique!"

"What?! Are you looking down on my strength? Don't you see these muscles? Do you have anything like this?"

Tess turned her head away as if she'd witnessed something disgusting. It would be more comfortable to have a conversation with a cow than discuss finesse with a macho type.

"Are the swordsmen done? Then it's my turn."

The archer stepped forward, drawing the longbow from his back.

Based on the results so far, it seemed difficult to achieve high scores with physical force alone.

While arrows were also physical attacks, the archer was confident. Though it was an expensive method that pained his wallet, wouldn't he invite ridicule if he didn't show off his specialty?

"So you're planning to use that."

As the mage said, the archer removed an arrow from behind his back and took off the arrowhead. Then he pulled out a uniquely shaped arrowhead from a hard leather pouch attached to his pants.

The tip wasn't sharp but rounded like an almond, and instead of the common iron color, it was purple.

"Hmm, good. Should I try this one?"

Amy's eyes lit up seeing the uniquely colored arrowhead. Certainly, that would be able to deliver a much more powerful impact than an ordinary arrow.

"Shirone, look at that. It's a magic bullet."

"Huh? That is?"

Shirone had also heard about magic bullets during class. They were objects made by injecting magic into magic stones that could only be extracted in extremely small quantities from nature.

The principle behind magic stone formation was a mystery, but the prevailing theory was that it was a chemical reaction responding to unique natural phenomena.

For instance, lightning magic stones could be harvested from dry highlands or tropical rainforests where thunder and lightning frequently struck.

The minerals harvested this way showed affinity for specific phenomena, and magical engineers had succeeded in using these properties to store magic in magic stones.

Of course, this level of success could hardly be called an achievement—it was merely laboratory science.

To utilize magic stones in real life required materials engineering to convert them into energy, and mechanical engineering to consume those materials in various forms.

The entire process from mining magic stones to consuming them in society was supported by so many workers and enormous capital that it could truly be called an industry.

And competing for the top position in that industry was the lethal weapon known as magic bullets.

"So that's the expensive magic bullet. How does it compare to the magic we use?"

"It's not particularly more powerful. The huge merit is that even non-mages can use magic. That one probably costs 1 gold. Even though the actual magic bullet in the arrowhead weighs only 10 grams."

Shirone stuck out his tongue. 1 gold for just one pull of the bowstring. Then how much money had been poured into the barrage of 3,000 archers with magic bullets mentioned in the history books?

"That's an incredible item. I don't think I could bear to use it because I'd feel too sorry about the cost."

"Well, since we're mages, it's natural to think about getting our money's worth. But in actual combat, having magic bullets or not is an incredibly important issue. In a situation where you'd definitely die, one magic bullet could save your life."

"I see. But you know a lot about it. They don't teach things like that in class."

"I only learned recently too. The reason my big brother came home was because of a magic bullet supply deal for the archer unit. For the past year, it seems like a company has been committing fraud, but they don't know at which stage the money is leaking out. I was curious and asked Nade about it, and he knew everything from the manufacturing process to the production techniques in detail."

"Huh? Nade? When did you ask him about that?"

"There was a school closure after you woke up. I heard rumors that he made an invisibility cloak—if that's true, it's incredible technology. I bet Nade could make magic bullets too."

"What? Make those expensive things directly?"

"What, didn't you know? Are you really his life-or-death friend?"

"Haha, well... But Nade always shows me weird things. Like carriages that never stop or dolls that dance twelve different funny dances."

"True, just having the skill doesn't make it possible. It's a national monopoly business, so without getting a license, you'd be arrested for illegal weapon manufacturing. But if you're bored later, try asking him to make one. If you ask, he'll probably make it for you. Magic stones can be purchased cheaply from the Alchemy Foundation."

While Shirone and Amy were talking, the archer released the safety mechanism of the magic bullet.

Impact-reactive magic bullets must always have safety devices engaged except when passing through danger zones. If they reacted from being hit by a carriage or something, you'd lose a leg.

"Hey, I'm going to use a magic bullet from now on. It's called Lightning Arrow. Step back if you're close—you might get caught up in it."

Shirone's group moved as far away as possible while still being able to watch. They had expected the Labyrinth of Time and Space to absorb magical power, but it never hurt to be careful.

When the archer pulled the bowstring taut, even the tension in the air seemed to rise. A moment later, when he released his grip with a twang, the arrow embedded itself in the Labyrinth of Time and Space with a whistling sound.

The magic bullet reacted, unleashing a powerful lightning bolt.

However, the blue electricity was occurring only inside the orb. As expected, it seemed to absorb magical power too.

The orb flashed for about 3 seconds, then quieted down. Thinking it was indeed worth the money, people waited for the number to appear.

1,020.

When a four-digit score appeared, the archer's lips curved upward.

But the result was still a failure. Even after scoring over a thousand, the archer came down from the altar thinking about his losses when he didn't achieve results.

"Tch! What the hell, I just wasted money?"

"You can't really say that. From what I can see, your body seems fine—are you okay?"

At Amy's words, the archer checked his condition. He had repeatedly seen the swordsmen's legs give out, but this time he felt perfectly normal.

"Huh? You're right. It seems like it doesn't drain an archer's muscle strength. The Labyrinth of Time and Space appears to measure only impact damage."

"That could be useful information too. What will you do? Want to try again?"

The archer stared intently at the orb. In any case, since he'd achieved the highest score, his mood wasn't too bad. But he declined to waste any more money than this.

"No thanks. No matter what attribute I use, it won't make much difference, and I don't think I can pass with this. The magic bullets are too precious."

Amy readily agreed.

"Then is it the mages' turn now? Shirone, who should go first? You or me?"

The mage from the mercenary side smirked and pointed at Amy.

"Why don't you try? Since I'm next, we'll be able to clearly compare who's stronger."

Amy accepted the challenge as if she had nothing to fear. Come to think of it, she still had some unfinished business with that woman.

"Fine. Shirone, then I'll go first?"

"Yeah. Show us your skills. Fighting!"

Shirone thought Amy had a chance. Her specialty was attack magic specialized in fire-type. Moreover, she was a target-type who emphasized single-strike power.

While there were countless types of magic and trends changed according to development speed, fire attributes always ranked at the top in terms of power—they were the powerhouses of the magic world.

But Amy was cautious. Standing on the altar, she was calculating which magic to deploy.

'This is unexpectedly tricky. The distance is too close to use sniper mode. Should I just attack with target-type? But then the power would decrease.'

Unlike ice-type magic where absolute zero was the limit, fire-type magic had no upper limit for temperature increase.

Attracted by that infinite possibility, countless mages chose fire, but even high-level mages found it difficult to break through the 1,000-degree Celsius barrier.

Still, fire was strong. Most things on the planet were under the dominion of 1,000 degrees.

Living creatures, trees, and most metals except iron were bound to burn under heat energy.

But just as there were no perfect attributes in the world, fire-type magic also had its weaknesses.

Namely, lightness.

While the total energy amount was tremendous, it lacked heaviness. So usually air-type magic was incorporated to supplement striking power, with Flame Strike being a representative example.

'But due to Flame Strike's characteristics, the power multiplies with distance. In cases like this, would it be better to focus on pure fire instead?'

Since the Labyrinth of Time and Space measured magical power rather than just impact, competing with pure-type magic that could purely increase temperature was also a good strategy.

Thinking of magic that fit this approach, Amy made her decision.

'Fireball.'

Two flames blazed above Amy's palms. Originally spherical, but due to fire's nature, they formed teardrop shapes shooting upward.

The difference between magically created fire and real fire was density. That is, fire mages controlled the density of fire to increase temperature. Moreover, as temperature increased, the radius of fire spread could also be expanded.

Amy only rotated her wrists from her flame-holding stance. Then red-hot fireballs like lava flew out, trailing tails behind them.

As soon as the flames struck, the Labyrinth of Time and Space inhaled the fire. An enormous whirlpool of fire continuously circulated inside the orb.

When the score finally appeared, people burst into exclamations.

3,270.

It was the highest record so far. And based on the results so far, it seemed difficult to exceed this score.

The archer realized that Shirone's group were not ordinary students. His Electric Arrow enhanced with magic bullet power had scored 1,020. But for the basic magic Fireball to exceed three times that power meant their magical level was fundamentally different.

However, Amy scowled fiercely. As if this wasn't nearly enough, the Labyrinth of Time and Space was emitting fierce red light.

"What the hell! What exactly do you want me to do?"

She had thought it would be fine, but when she actually failed, she was so frustrated she could go crazy.

"Ho ho ho! That's what you get for being a novice. Is it my turn now?"

"Wait! Let me try with sniper mode. I'm going to see exactly how much it demands today and settle this."

Shirone approached the altar with a troubled smile. Amy, with her exceptional competitive spirit, would never come down unless he went and stopped her directly.

"Calm down first. If you get angry and lose focus, your score will be even worse."

"Ugh, seriously! Shirone, I'm definitely trying again. Got it?"

The mage who had climbed onto the altar looked back at Amy and said:

"How coincidentally, we're mages of the same type? I'm also fire magic. In the spirit of matching your level, I'll try with Fireball too."

'Hmph, how ridiculous. She had the exact same idea as me.'

Amy responded with a snort. In any case, failures had no right to speak, so even responding was annoying.
