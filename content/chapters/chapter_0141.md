The mage returned with a serious expression. She then created a sphere of fire between her palms.

Unlike Amy, it was a single sphere, so concentrating the density would be much easier.

'She's going to focus the firepower, huh? She really desperately wants to win.'

Just as Amy expected, the mage was tense. Of course, since she had never calculated magic power numerically, she had no idea what score would come out.

But no matter how she thought about it, producing three times the power of Electric Arrow didn't seem too difficult.

"Taha!"

The mage thrust both hands forward forcefully.

Within the Spirit Zone under the mage's control, inertia is ignored, so there's no need for special motions when casting magic.

Still, the fact that she took a firing stance was the mage's desperate attempt to increase even a bit of concentration.

Amy followed the Fireball with her gaze. As the Labyrinth of Time and Space absorbed the fire, a whirlwind of flames swirled about.

The mage looked at the sphere with eyes full of expectation. But moments later, her face turned sullen.

The score was 1,330. Only 310 points higher than Electric Arrow.

For swordsmen who are evaluated purely on physical ability, this would be an enormous difference, but in the realm of magic that applies phenomena, it was more or less the same.

"Th-this can't be. No! This is because the firepower was dispersed. I can definitely get over 2,000."

No one responded to the mage's voice.

The difference was too great. No matter what she tried, she couldn't surpass Amy's score.

The archer already thought passing through here was hopeless. The red-haired girl who scored over 3,000 points would be the highest-level person here.

Even the mage called a saint in the mercenary world scored 1,330. But showing more than twice that magical power meant she had at least the strongest talent among peers of the same age.

Rian and Tess thought similarly.

It wasn't that they were disparaging Shirone's skills, but Amy was Shirone's senior at school. Since she, a graduating class student, had failed, they expected it would be difficult for even Shirone to show anything better.

The only person who didn't think this was the end was Amy herself.

"Shirone, you need to be serious. Maybe it's just a narrow difference that prevented passing."

"Got it. I'll do my best."

The leader sneered with pursed lips.

"Ha! What good is doing your best? You need results. It's already over. Let's fold and go back."

Shirone realized something from the leader's appearance of giving up without even trying. The Labyrinth of Time and Space, called the angel's eyes. What had she created this altar for?

But the fleeting insight had to be set aside for now. Concentrating on the altar's task was the priority.

Shirone closed his eyes and performed the sequence formula. A faint point of light was born in front. Then countless photons rushed toward the center, growing in size.

"Wh-what? Photon output? What kind of impact can that create?"

The mage spoke with a bewildered expression. Still, the reason she couldn't take her eyes off Shirone was because of the force that couldn't be seen in ordinary photon output.

The moment Shirone opened his eyes after finishing the sequence formula, a fist-sized white sphere vibrated as if furiously angry.

Shirone gritted his teeth and fired the Photon Cannon. The beam of light extending at near-light speed struck the Labyrinth of Time and Space as if to shatter it.

Even the mercenaries who hadn't expected much at first were captivated by the beauty of the flash and waited for the score with trembling hearts.

4,783.

When an unexpected number appeared, people's eyes widened.

Especially the mage and archer, who had knowledge of magic, were shocked. Because the magic Shirone cast was none other than photon output.

Light has no special firepower. There's only the impact defined solely by the product of speed and mass.

Yet it scored 4,783 points. Compared to his companions, it was equivalent to the impact when twenty warriors with strength-enhancing builds struck with all their might.

"Wh-what the hell are those things?"

The mercenaries began to feel uneasy. They didn't know the principle behind Shirone's magic, but if hit by it, none of their companions could withstand it.

But everyone had no time to think of anything else. Despite the tremendous power of the strike, the Labyrinth of Time and Space boldly emitted red light, giving a failing grade.

Shirone felt completely drained. What kind of sphere was this anyway?

Perhaps 5,000 points might be the passing threshold. But with Photon Cannon, it seemed impossible to increase the power beyond this.

"I wish I could try once more."

Amy covered her mouth and laughed as if she'd been waiting.

"Hoho! You understand my feelings, right? I felt the same way. But really, how many points do you need to pass?"

"I don't know. I think it might work if I try with laser."

"Ah, that's right! Laser can accumulate energy."

Shirone's laser vibrates molecules and produces greater destructive power as time passes. In theory, there's nothing it can't destroy, making it perfect for this kind of evaluation.

"But there's a next turn. I should try after going around once. What are you doing? Won't you try?"

Shirone said to the leader. But he just stood there with a disgusted expression.

As he watched the scores soar with each turn, he couldn't bring himself to step forward. The score he could produce as a swordsman would be around 200 points at most.

"Tch! Forget it. It's already over! We have nothing left but to go back."

The leader walked toward the entrance with urgent movements. But no matter how much he turned the door handle, the iron door wouldn't budge.

When the puzzled party looked back, the man with white tattoos spoke.

"You are one. If one person has been evaluated, everyone must be evaluated. You cannot return until then."

After hearing the archer's translation, the party finally understood. It wasn't just about unifying will, but a rule requiring actual actions to match as well.

"Ah! How annoying! Why do you keep making us do something that's pointless?"

The leader's complaints were endless. But to leave this place, he had no choice but to prove his skills.

'I see. This is truly a cruel rule.'

Shirone got goosebumps.

Why hadn't he realized it until now? All the rules explained by the man with white tattoos were premised on one condition.

Trust among companions.

When he thought about it, it was truly a strange evaluation method. In terms of firepower alone, mages were much more advantageous than swordsmen.

But that didn't mean swordsmen were weaker than mages. Even if mages could shatter rocks and split the earth, swordsmen were specialized in biological combat who could cut down those mages with a single stroke.

Moreover, measuring magical power was also problematic. If Amy, who specialized in long-range magic, had attempted sniper mode, she would have achieved a much higher score. But this place didn't consider such variables.

A narrow octagonal altar with no room for special tactics, and 8 spheres.

'Why 8? Just to balance the appearance? But actually, didn't we 8 people take the evaluation with just one sphere?'

Most strange of all was the divine language. The Labyrinth of Time and Space measures impact and displays it numerically.

Why exactly? What meaning could that have?

If it was to distinguish those going to Kergo, wouldn't it be enough to simply show pass or fail?

The score variance becomes enormous depending on one's specialty. In such a state, a structure where everyone must be evaluated.

The emotion that arises from this is one thing.

'Obsession with scores. When companions get higher scores than oneself, one becomes anxious. When they get lower scores, one looks down on them. Without perfect understanding of each other's roles, discord is inevitable. And what waits at the end of those rules is...'

One person can be sent through the sacrifice of one person.

Shirone took a deep breath. What was the labyrinth thinking? This was an evaluation designed to make people kill each other.

"Shirone, let's just leave after that person finishes."

Amy whispered. Whether she had the same thought, tension showed in her eyes as well.

Rian and Tess also wore serious expressions as if something was strange.

Since they were people who emphasized camaraderie, it was natural for them to be sensitive to such an atmosphere, and since this was clearly an evaluation disadvantageous to swordsmen, they would have been quick to grasp the rules' intention.

As expected, the leader was at a loss. He could feel that his mercenary companions' gazes toward him were different from before.

"Huff, huff, uaaaah!"

The leader charged without even having time to catch his breath. Though he was rushing forward, to Shirone's eyes, it looked as if he was running away from something.

Was his Schema properly opened? Where was his sword positioned? How far was it to the target? Running without knowing anything, his steps got tangled.

Taking a short gasp and swinging his sword as if collapsing, the inaccurate blade hit the side of the sphere and bounced off.

"Kuk! Damn it!"

The leader, who had tried to pass through the Labyrinth of Time and Space and exit the altar, hastily regained his balance and looked back.

The number 32 was floating there.

But no one laughed. His companions' expressions were frozen as if they had suffered a tremendous humiliation.

"So what! It wasn't going to pass anyway! I did it, so that's enough, right? Let's just leave!"

The leader made unnecessary excuses and left the altar. But his steps were heading away from his companions.

'That party is finished. They'll probably disband once they leave here.'

Shirone thought he should stop here. Though it was disappointing that he couldn't challenge again, he couldn't do anything more with mercenaries whose trust had been broken.

"Excuse me... Could you translate for me?"

Shirone asked the archer. Even if they were leaving, there was one thing he wanted to confirm.

The archer, who also seemed to feel futility about the current situation, readily agreed.

"Sure. What should I ask for you?"

"Has anyone passed through this gate so far?"

The man with white tattoos nodded firmly.

"It is a gate for passage. Not some kind of trap."

"How many points do you need in the Labyrinth of Time and Space to pass?"

"The angel's eight eyes will judge you."

The man repeated what he had said initially. In the end, everything was decided by the Labyrinth of Time and Space.

Shirone thought for a moment and asked his final question.

"What's the passing rate among people who come here?"

"I don't know exactly. Sometimes many come, sometimes just one. From what I've observed, about one in ten seems to pass. Most of the time, the passing rate is higher when people come alone."

Shirone was startled. It was a much higher rate than expected.

At first, he had thought there might be no one who passed. This was because of his assumption that the labyrinth's purpose in designing this place wasn't simply to evaluate skills.

Of course, that thought remained unchanged. But the man with white tattoos had clearly said there were people who passed. And at the tremendous rate of 10 percent.

The corners of Shirone's mouth, which had been smiling, trembled. A thrill ran up his spine.

"Shirone, why are you suddenly acting like that?"

"The headmaster... is really a mischievous one."

"Huh? What are you suddenly talking about?"

Amy asked puzzledly, but Shirone wasn't in a state to answer. He seemed to hear Alpheas's voice like a hallucination.

-You'll be able to roughly understand what kind of world the labyrinth lives in.

Not roughly, but clearly understood. It meant that if one couldn't pass even this level of ordeal, one shouldn't try to learn about the labyrinth.

'I'm sorry, headmaster. But I've come to understand.'

Shirone didn't give up. He was determined to pass through this place within the travel period.

Amy looked at Shirone, who wasn't answering, and guessed.

'You haven't given up, have you, Shirone.'

Then she wouldn't give up either. Initially, she had followed just to help Shirone, but now she truly wanted to know about the woman called the labyrinth.
