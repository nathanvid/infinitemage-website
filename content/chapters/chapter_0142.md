"Come on, let's get out of here now! No complaints, right? Hey, open this iron door!"

The leader pounded on the iron door. His pride was crushed, and he couldn't bear his comrades' cold stares any longer.

"Do you all agree?"

The man asked, though no translation was really needed. The mercenaries nodded without hesitation and headed toward the door.

Their hearts were in shambles. Coming here had truly been the wrong choice. They'd tried to make a profit from the loop, only to damage their relationships and waste their money.

"Guys, let's get out quickly. Come this way."

The mercenaries' attitude had changed from before. Their sense of futility was great, but given that the children's abilities were anything but ordinary, it was better to read the room.

However, Shirone's group wasn't even taking a step, just watching the mercenaries.

The mage grew subtly anxious. As if her ominous premonitions were never wrong, Amy said coldly:

"We don't want to leave yet, though?"

The mercenaries' heads all turned in unison. Various emotions crossed their eyesâ€”anger, bewilderment, fear.

The quick-thinking mage swallowed her anger and spoke in a soothing tone:

"Why don't you want to leave? It's already over, right? We're too tired now, so we don't want to do this anymore either."

"That's your problem. Once you enter this place, everyone becomes one. Don't you know? It's troublesome if you just leave as you please without even asking our opinion."

The mage was upset, but right now she had no choice but to humor Amy.

"Alright. I didn't think that far ahead. So let's go."

"Sorry, but that won't work. We need to pass through here and go to Kergo right now."

"But there's no way to get through! Ah...!"

The woman's face turned pale. There was a way.

This was the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice. It wasn't necessarily required to prove only achievement.

The man with white tattoos spoke quietly:

"Will you leave or stay? If you want to prove your abilities, pass through the Labyrinth of Time and Space. If you want to prove sacrifice, you can send four people with the sacrifice of four."

"Huh? What's he saying?"

Before Rian could finish asking, the archer translated. Of course, it was completely distorted and modified language.

"Ah, he's saying if you're done with your business, leave quickly."

Amy smiled and said:

"That's strange? I distinctly heard this: you can send four people with the sacrifice of four."

Shock filled the archer's eyes.

"You... don't tell me you knew the native language?"

"What are you talking about? We heard it when we first came in. Do you think we're idiots? Can't even remember something we heard once?"

The archer gaped in bewilderment. Ah, is that how it was? No, wait? Remembering words you're hearing for the first time would actually be stranger, wouldn't it?

"Anyway, the sacrifice of four people. One, two, three, four. That's exactly four people."

The color drained from the mercenaries' faces. That girl was really thinking of sacrificing someone.

Rian and Tess also felt tension like in real combat. Especially Tess, who stomped her feet as cute Amy turned scary.

"Shirone, is this really okay? Hiing, Amy is too scary."

"It's fine. She's doing it on purpose."

"On purpose? It doesn't seem like it though."

"Just watch. Amy will handle it well."

The mercenaries looked at each other. If they fought, they would definitely lose. Rian and the warrior were evenly matched, and Tess was stronger than the leader.

Moreover, they had been overwhelmed in the mage's battle, and against Shirone's photon magic, even the archer's existence was useless.

"Come at us then. You all look like you don't want to sacrifice. Either way, you have to do your best too."

"Why are you doing this? Is it because of what we did at the tavern?"

Amy tilted her head teasingly.

"Hmm?"

The archer realized that clumsy responses wouldn't resolve the situation. He walked toward Shirone's group and bowed politely.

"Sorry! We looked down on you and made a mistake. Please forgive us just once. Hey, you guys come and apologize too."

When the archer looked back with his head still bowed, the other three reluctantly walked over. But since their lives were at stake, their apologetic attitude was at least respectful.

"Sorry! I was too arrogant. Please forgive me."

"I won't do it again. I learned a lot from this incident. So could you please pretend that our mistake at the tavern never happened?"

Amy frowned and said:

"Hmm, I have no idea. What mistake did you make toward us exactly? Wait, tavern? Don't tell me you were at that tavern? That's strange. Why didn't I see you?"

The mercenaries' faces turned bright red. Rather than just having their pride crushed, it felt like it was being thrown to the ground and trampled.

Even Shirone couldn't help but shudder at Amy's persistence this time.

'This is what happens when you make Amy angry.'

At the tavern, Amy and Tess had received the most attacks when they were mocked. They had endured all kinds of insults and humiliation just because they were women. Amy wasn't one to forget such a time, even if decades passed, until she got her revenge.

But in a way, this could be called the textbook behavior of a mage obsessed with efficiency.

Even if it wasn't necessary to go that far, mages got irritated by the fact that they hadn't utilized 100 percent of the advantages given to them.

That's why people often called mages eccentric. There were indeed many mages who lacked humanity.

But it was because of this obsessively efficiency-seeking mentality that magic had developed until now and could continue to develop in the future.

'What do they expect us to do? Damn it.'

The mercenaries didn't know what to do and just kept their heads bowed. The sound of grinding teeth seemed to reach here.

Amy finally got to the main point.

"I'll make one proposal. If you accept it, I might go out together with you."

"What kind...?"

"You said you need to know the password to enter this place, right? What's that password?"

The archer realized. Those kids were thinking of challenging again. They planned to come back here after conducting numerous investigations and verifying sufficient possibilities.

"Kertia, ro hoima. Akrasia, widmia benzen. That's the password."

"What does it mean?"

"Knock on my door, and it shall be opened."

Amy looked back at the man with white tattoos. Then she pronounced the ancient language the archer had taught her without missing a single syllable.

"Kertia, ro hoima. Akrasia, widmia benzen?"

The natives guarding the exit understood Amy's intention and nodded.

The archer felt really upset. No, in a way, should he say he was impressed? Her thoroughness was astounding.

"Damn it! Trust people a little! Would I lie even in this situation?"

"Who said anything? There's nothing wrong with being certain. Anyway, got it. Thank you."

Amy approached her friends with a cheerful face as if nothing had happened. Tess stuck out her tongue at how her emotional colors changed like a chameleon.

"You did that to find out the password? Do you know how nervous I was thinking we were really going to fight?"

"Hehe, if we're going to come back anyway, it's good to know. Let's go out too."

When both Shirone's group and the mercenary gang expressed their intention to leave, the man with white tattoos pulled a device next to the iron door.

The entrance shook violently and guided the way out.

Just like when they entered, the mercenary gang went up the stairs first.

But the atmosphere itself was different from then. They all hung their heads like defeated soldiers, and no one conversed.

Shirone's group was equally silent.

Though they hadn't entered the autonomous zone, such problems could be resolved by strategizing from now on.

Rather, their heads were complicated with thoughts about the Labyrinth of Time and Space they had experienced today.

'Labyrinth of Time and Space. Why exactly did the maze create this device? And why did it establish such cruel rules? What is in Kergo? Is there some connection between Kergo and the maze from the beginning? I want to know. Perhaps the maze is...'

While Shirone analyzed the maze, Amy following behind was also absorbed in her own thoughts.

'There isn't just one way to investigate ruins. Let's establish every possible strategy. Shirone seems to have his own ideas, but we can't rule out the method of exploring underground with Spirit Zone either. Even if we pass through, there's the problem of translation. Once we get outside, I should look for someone who can translate. We should be able to find someone among the locals.'

Tess was equally impressed by this place. Especially being able to quantify and confirm her own military power was considerable progress.

'The impact force of three swords can be stronger than blunt weapons. But in the end, it didn't match magic. Can a swordsman pass through that door? If possible, to what extent? The fact that Shirone's magic approached 5,000 means it's roughly ten times my single strike. If we roughly double the passing standard, would Dad be able to do it? Ugh, if only I knew the cutline, I could set a goal. Since Shirone said he'd come back, I'll have to investigate more then.'

Finally, Rian following at the end was equally silent. He seemed to be pondering quite seriously, with wrinkles forming on his brow.

'What should I eat when we get out?'

After walking for about 30 minutes, Shirone's group arrived at the altar on the surface.

When they knocked on the door from inside, a native opened it, but the group couldn't help but feel tense due to the inertia learned underground.

Coming outside, the fresh air cleansed their lungs. Though it had been just a few hours' journey, the sun floating in the sky didn't seem like today's.

Shirone's group and the mercenary gang split in opposite directions. But they hadn't disappeared from view. Shirone's group wanted to savor the lingering feelings, and the mercenary gang was on the verge of collapse.

Shirone wrapped up the day's activities.

"What should we do now? Since we had more results than expected, shall we end today's ruin exploration with this?"

Amy was also in complete agreement.

"Let's do that. I'm tired after using my strength for the first time in a while. I need to go in early and establish countermeasures."

Rian spoke as if he'd discovered something amazing.

"Before that, how about we grab a bowl of noodles? That place earlier was delicious."

Tess's gaze pierced Rian.

"Are you eating noodles again? At least suggest something like spicy buckwheat noodles. That's why you're so simple."

"What's wrong with that? Do you know how much I agonized over this decision!"

"So what? You go in circles and end up in the same place."

While Rian and Tess were fighting over the menu, the mercenaries approached. Shirone's group stopped their conversation and looked at them.

The warrior, mage, and archer were there, but the leader had disappeared somewhere and wasn't visible.

The mercenaries couldn't readily speak and exchanged glances. Eventually, the mage was selected as the suitable candidate and pushed forward.

But even she seemed quite awkward in this situation, and it took a while for words to come out.

"Um... would you perhaps like to join our mercenary group?"

"Mercenary group?"

"Yeah. You know, the mercenary profession has many good points too. Not only honor, but you can also make a lot of money. Especially with your skills, you'd become stars immediately. As you can see, the leader just quit earlier... Oh, of course, you could be the new leader. If you give orders, we'll absolutely follow, and if other people join, we'll really treat them well. How about it?"

Shirone stared directly at the mage's bright, hopeful eyes. Then, as if he hadn't even thought about it, he said immediately:

"No thanks."

With that, he turned and left, and his friends followed behind Shirone without any regret.

"Let's just eat noodles like I said. Honestly, it was delicious, wasn't it?"

"No way. You just want to fill your stomach first no matter what. If we wait just a little, we can eat something much more delicious."

The mercenaries stared blankly at Shirone's group as they walked away.

The mage's face turned into a crying expression, and a sigh mixed with worry escaped.

"Ugh, my unfortunate life."
