There was a secret space within the tavern palace. A place that only Falcoa from the Freeman organization could access.

It was the Loop manufacturing facility.

"Arrogant little brats! You think this is over?"

Standing beside Falcoa, Gis's heart was pounding. Though he had witnessed Falcoa's eccentric behavior for a long time, the current situation was far from normal.

'What the hell is he trying to do? Why did he suddenly bring me here?'

Gis had been returning after finishing his day as a tout at the harbor when Falcoa's subordinates captured him and brought him to this place.

Though a full day had passed since Shirone's group caused a disturbance at the tavern and left, Falcoa's anger seemed far from subsiding.

"Keke, just wait and see. I won't let this slide."

Falcoa grinned grotesquely, his mouth stretching wide. The hateful faces of Shirone's group flickered in his mind.

Amy was definitely the most detestable of them all.

When she had gulped down the Loop-laced drink Falcoa offered in one go and brazenly displayed her Insight, Falcoa had nearly drawn his sword immediately, money be damned.

Gis glanced fearfully at Falcoa from the corner of his eye.

What Falcoa was currently fiddling with was a device for turning Loop into powder.

The Loop roots were compressed to extract their juice, then ground until all moisture evaporated, leaving only fine powder.

But could that even be called a drug anymore?

Originally, Loop was meant to be chewed as tree roots, neutralized with saliva. But what he was making now was no different from a toxic chemical substance that maximized only the effects.

"Gis, we need to go back again."

"Wh-where to?"

"To that Amy girl. Since it worked once, it should work again this time. Don't tell me you can't do it. If you have eyes, you should know what state I'm in."

Gis swallowed hard. He had expected some form of revenge, but he hadn't anticipated things would go this far off track.

Gis had sensed that Amy came from an extraordinary family background. If they laid a hand on her, it would only be a matter of time before the island was reduced to ashes, regardless of the Galliant government or anything else.

"You're not thinking of... poisoning her, are you?"

"Poison? You idiot. That woman will never get poisoned. Come on. Would the renowned master of Insight from the continent get poisoned by mere Loop?"

"Then there's no need to do this, right? You'll only be stirring up unnecessary trouble."

Gis tried to persuade Falcoa with a glimmer of hope.

But Falcoa seemed beyond listening to anyone's words.

"You dim-witted fool. Can't your brain work that well? Haven't you considered that this operation will succeed precisely because she absolutely won't get poisoned?"

Falcoa placed the powdered Loop into oil paper. Then he poured it all into a glass of water he had prepared beforehand.

Gis's breath stopped involuntarily.

Though he had never used Loop, he knew how it was supposed to be used.

Normally, one root would be enough to chew for about two hours. But the amount Falcoa had just dissolved in water was three times that.

Moreover, since it was in solution form, she would receive all at once the drug effects that would normally take six hours to manifest.

"No way..."

"That's right, exactly that. I'm going to make her drink this again. That girl will confidently accept and drink it. But with this amount of Loop, she'll die without question. You understand what I'm saying?"

"Wh-why would you do such a thing? If she dies, you can't sell her either."

"Keke, it doesn't matter. Bring me the corpse if you have to."

Falcoa put the Loop solution into a glass bottle. As the solution mixed with the beverage in the bottle, it looked like a pretty jade-colored cocktail.

"Here, take it. It's a simple job. Lure her out saying you have something to talk about, make her drink this, then load her into a carriage and bring her here. You can do it, right?"

Gis stared at the glass bottle with bloodshot eyes. His body trembled with fear.

Amy wouldn't refuse. And if she took even one sip, it would be over.

"What are you doing, not taking it? Or do you want to drink it yourself?"

Falcoa's killing intent pressed down on Gis. The murderous aura seemed to take shape like hands, gripping his throat tightly.

"Stop it, you piece of trash."

"What?"

Falcoa doubted his own ears.

Was there still some Loop effect lingering? That couldn't be it. Thanks to never taking the Loop root out of his mouth for even a moment, even the drug's effects had become dulled by now.

"What did you just say? Say it again."

Sometimes when a person experiences something too absurd, they actually become calmer. That's how Falcoa felt now.

Getting angry could come later. First, it was important to confirm once more whether what this wet-behind-the-ears brat had said was real.

Gis found the words stuck in his throat.

Perhaps this was his last chance. Even now, if he begged for forgiveness, he might get away with just half-dead beating.

'But...'

Gis couldn't bring himself to kneel before Falcoa.

—I don't dislike guys like you.

That single phrase she had said with a smile in the carriage rendered Gis completely immobile.

Why was that? He could just admit to being weak.

The moment he begged Falcoa for forgiveness, it would make Amy a liar, and even though he wanted to take back what he'd said, the words wouldn't come out of his mouth.

"I said stop it, you filthy bastard. You're not even human. A guy so addled with drugs he can't tell right from wrong! Calling you trash would be a compliment!"

Gis felt dizzy. As pleasure and terror mixed together, his mind became uncontrollable and his consciousness grew distant.

But he spat out the words.

Just like Shirone. Like someone for whom the future didn't exist.

Falcoa's fist swung like lightning toward the face of the clearly deranged Gis.

"Urgh!"

As his vision went black, he finally realized the reality. What awaited Gis was a miserable future that could only be described as hell.

"You crazy bastard! What happened to your head!"

Falcoa finally showed his true colors and began beating Gis mercilessly.

It wasn't just intimidating violence. He was really kicking Gis's body as if to kill him.

If he had even activated his Schema, Gis's body would have been pulverized like meat hanging in a butcher shop.

"Die! Die! Die!"

Gis couldn't even scream.

The feeling of his entire body being smashed was brief—now he couldn't feel anything. Only impacts beyond the realm of pain reached him.

"Phew, right. Killing a guy like you wouldn't even be fun."

Falcoa regained his reason. But that was a sign that even greater misfortune would befall Gis.

"Cough! Cough!"

Falcoa grabbed Gis by the hair and lifted him up. It felt like his neck bones were cracking, but Gis was in too much of a mess to even worry about such things.

"Fine, then I have an idea too."

If Gis wouldn't cooperate, there was no way to trap Amy, but Falcoa had grown tired of dealing with trivial circumstances.

"I'm moved, Gis. For a worthless guy like you to show such courage. You seem smitten with that girl, so as you wish, I won't touch her. How about that, happy?"

"Pl-please... please have mercy just this once."

Gis shed tears. He already knew what Falcoa was thinking.

"Yuna, wasn't it? Your little sister's name. From now on, you'll regret the decision you made today for the rest of your life."

"No. Please, not Yuna... Cough!"

Falcoa slammed Gis's head to the floor. Like a ball, Gis's face bounced off the ground with a thud and then plummeted down. With that single blow, Gis lost consciousness.

"Kekeke, things got interesting anyway."

Of course, just because his target had changed to Gis's sister didn't mean he planned to forgive Amy. He intended to bring Yuna to the hideout, torment her, then threaten Gis. With his sister's life at stake, Gis would have no choice but to comply.

"Bring that Yuna girl to the hideout right now!"

After barking furious orders at his subordinates, Falcoa chewed an entire Loop root.

When Shirone's group arrived at the villa, it was already close to midnight. Given the distance, they had stopped midway to have dinner before returning.

Though they hadn't achieved the desired results in the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice, there was much they had learned.

The four's conversation never ceased, and eventually even stories they had kept in their hearts began to spill out.

"Oh my, you want to become a soldier?"

Tess opened her eyes wide in surprise after hearing Amy's career aspirations. She hadn't expected Amy to be aiming for military service at all.

Of course, being a flame-type mage who had honed sniper mode made her perfect for combat magic.

But the Amy that Tess knew was, despite appearances, delicate and caring. She couldn't imagine such a person going to battlefields and taking down countless enemies.

"Honestly, I'm worried. I thought Amy would suit more feminine professions."

"Huh? Me in feminine professions? I've never heard such talk even at school."

Tess could guess how spirited Amy's school life had been. But she, who was good at reading people's true feelings, knew Amy's real nature.

"Fufu, I have some expertise in intelligence operations. The girl called Amy is actually very delicate and feminine."

Amy smiled subtly. Though she had never thought of herself as feminine, she couldn't strongly deny it either.

No matter how spirited her personality, since the military was a man's world, she wasn't confident she could adapt properly.

"Actually, I'm not sure. I chose flame magic because target form is my specialty. So I ended up having to choose the profession most advantageous for my major. Of course, I think positively about the military profession. Fighting on battlefields isn't the only thing soldiers do."

"That's right. There are supply officers too. If you join the operations command, the future would be bright. Oh right! How about this?"

As Tess clapped her hands as if suddenly remembering something, Amy asked with curious eyes.

"Hm? What?"

Tess extended her index and middle fingers, pretending to aim at someone walking on the beach in the dark night.

"Intelligence agent. With Amy's level, your thinking ability is outstanding, and your specialty is long-range attacks, right? Above all, you have the most important weapon for intelligence work."

"Most important weapon? What's that?"

Amy's eyes sparkled with curiosity. From her position of contemplating her future, she couldn't help but get excited about having another advantage she didn't know about.

"A pretty face. Beauty is essential for female intelligence agents. There's no man in the world who dislikes beautiful women."

As Tess smiled mischievously, Amy turned her head with a sullen expression.

"Aw, what's that? I got my hopes up for nothing."

"Fufu, sorry. But it's not just a joke. When recruiting national intelligence agents, appearance is a top priority. In professions dealing with people, Amy's looks would be completely effective. So think about it seriously. I'll actively recommend you to our family."

"No, forget it. I'll rely only on my magical abilities."

Amy's face turned bright red. Though her words were blunt, she didn't seem to entirely dislike being called pretty.

'Aww, how cute. See how feminine she is?'

To Tess, Amy was a friend overflowing with the fun of teasing. As Tess was thinking of how to tease her more, she suddenly remembered something she was genuinely curious about.

"By the way, what happens after graduation?"

"Hm? Of course I'll take the certification exam first and find a job."

"No, I mean Shirone."

"Shirone? Why Shirone?"
