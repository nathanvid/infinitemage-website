Amy blinked at first, not understanding, then caught on to what Tess was trying to say and turned her head away with a flustered expression.

"You're suddenly saying strange things. What does Shirone have to do with my graduation?"

"But it's true, isn't it? Shirone is still in Class Four, and you're in the graduating class. Besides, with your skills, you'll definitely be able to graduate next year. When that happens, you'll leave for the capital, won't you?"

The moment Amy heard about leaving for the capital, her heart suddenly began racing.

She had never thought about it before. But realistically speaking, it wasn't such a distant future either.

"It has nothing to do with me."

"Oh, really?"

Though Amy spoke in a cold voice, Tess couldn't sense any sincerity in her tone at all.

After maintaining silence for a moment, Amy spilled what was on her mind, just as Tess had expected.

"Still... he made a promise. That he would definitely catch up to me. On that condition, I told him he could speak casually to me."

Tess pursed her lips and made an "oh" sound as if surprised. If such a conversation had taken place, then the feelings the two had for each other weren't so light after all.

"Hmm. Of course, Shirone is impressive too. But didn't he only advance to Class Four in half a year? No matter how much of a genius he is, could he really graduate that easily?"

In truth, Amy knew it too. The achievements Shirone had accomplished so far were things ordinary people couldn't even imitate.

An 18-year-old boy who had lived without even knowing magic had risen to Class Four in just half a year.

Perhaps wanting more than this was being greedy.

Amy looked at Shirone's back as he walked ahead. Had Shirone ever thought about this? If he really did graduate, would he truly miss her?

Taking a step ahead among people who were all doing their best was difficult. But Shirone was already several steps ahead. Perhaps he was running while burning all his talents to their limits.

Though Amy knew this fact, she couldn't help feeling hurt anyway. She glared at Shirone's back with sharp eyes and conveyed her thoughts silently.

'Hurry up and catch up. If you fall behind, I really won't let you off easy.'

Having finished their secretive conversation between women, the two quickened their pace to catch up with Shirone and Rian.

Shirone's group, reunited once again, climbed the hill toward the villa while chatting about various things. Suddenly, Tess stopped and warned in a low voice.

"Shh. Quiet."

"Why all of a sudden...?"

Amy turned to look at Tess as she asked. At first, she thought it was another one of her pranks. But when she saw that Tess's expression was serious, she immediately closed her mouth.

Tess, who trained in saber swordsmanship, primarily used sensory-type builds among Schema.

Though not as much as an archer, her sensitivity to stimuli far exceeded the range of ordinary people.

Shirone and Rian belatedly noticed the atmosphere and approached her. Tess raised her finger to signal them to stay quiet as well.

"There's someone in front of the villa. Based on lung capacity, it's a male. If average build, probably between 170 to 175 centimeters tall."

Rian grasped the handle of the straight sword hanging on his back. Since they had caused quite a commotion at the royal palace last night, the possibility of an intruder was sufficient.

"I don't sense hostility, but let's be prepared just in case."

As Tess walked forward, muffling her footsteps like a cat, the remaining three slowly followed behind her.

When they arrived at the villa, they confirmed someone was standing in front of the door. The silhouette, visible only in outline, wasn't moving at all and was looking elsewhere.

Shirone's group advanced without letting down their guard. But before they could take more than a few steps, the silhouette suddenly lost strength and collapsed to the ground.

Looking at each other, Shirone's group hurried to the door.

The midnight visitor was Gis. His face bore no unmarked spots, as if he had been beaten somewhere.

Shirone grabbed Gis's side and supported him. Just from that touch alone, Gis couldn't endure the pain and contorted his face.

"Ugh! It, it hurts!"

"Are you okay? Who did this to you?"

"G-get away!"

Gis pushed Shirone away. If he knew who had caused him to end up in this state, he wouldn't be able to get angry. At least in front of Amy, he didn't want to show a weak side.

Gis sat down with his back against the door. Just as Shirone approached to support him again, he painfully lifted the corners of his mouth and let out a hollow laugh.

"Did you play until this hour? Your life must be quite comfortable."

Though Gis's condition looked extremely critical, Tess didn't lower her guard until the end.

He was the very person who had lured Amy into danger using strange methods last night too. No matter how injured he was, she had no intention of trusting him.

On the other hand, Amy approached without hesitation. Rather than trusting Gis, as someone who knew the rules of this world, she was anticipating the circumstances to some degree.

"What on earth happened to you? Tell me. Was it Falcoa?"

Instead of answering Amy, Gis raised his head and glared at Shirone menacingly.

Now that he thought he could boldly glare at Shirone, he felt rather good.

Having fallen to rock bottom in life while protecting Amy's life. Shouldn't he be allowed to be the protagonist for about a minute while explaining the whole story?

"Hey, you. Listen carefully. Protect your woman properly."

"What are you talking about?"

When Shirone tilted his head in confusion, Gis fiercely frowned. He had been suspecting it since the conversation with Amy in the carriage. The fact that their relationship couldn't be clearly defined.

That made him even angrier. Why should he suffer like this because of Shirone, who had everything he himself couldn't have?

"Amy, you bastard! If you're going to cause trouble like that, protect her to the end!"

"I have no idea what you're talking about. Why Amy? I was with her all day today."

Gis recalled Falcoa's instructions. Even thinking about it now, it was so absurd that a hollow laugh burst out.

"He told me to bring her, even if I had to kill her. To put a lethal dose loop in a drink and bring it to Amy. He said Amy would have no choice but to drink it anyway."

"This crazy...!"

Rian's eyes widened like a tiger's as he clenched his fists. The others listening were equally enraged.

Of course, Amy wasn't foolish enough not to recognize Falcoa's scheme. But considering her pride and the ability of Insight, it could have been a terrible situation.

Tess, who had thought that far, shuddered with chills.

"He's insane. I knew he wasn't normal, but he really had gone all the way."

Shirone's voice was also trembling more than ever before.

"So that drink..."

"I threw it in the trash. I said I couldn't do it. Now do you understand? I protected Amy. Not you, but me! I risked my life to protect her! Did you get that, you idiot?"

Shirone's group kept their mouths firmly shut. They couldn't refute it, and didn't want to either.

Shirone knelt down to meet Gis at eye level.

"Gis, we..."

"That's why!"

Gis cut off Shirone's words and shouted. When he yelled with all his might, pain surged as if his ribs were breaking. But the reason he was crying like a waterfall wasn't because of the pain.

"That's why..."

Gis prostrated himself flat. And pressing his forehead to the ground, he spoke in a sobbing voice.

"Please help me."

Shirone's group couldn't say anything and just looked down at Gis lying prostrate.

"My sister... I think my sister was taken. When I came to my senses and went to the shop, they said she had gone home, so I went home but she wasn't there either. So I went looking for her... but no one would help me. Please find my sister. I'm begging you like this."

Having pleaded with Shirone's group, Gis burst into tears and kept repeating only the word "please."

Shirone watched that sight with feelings of anger and sadness seeping in simultaneously.

How long had he wandered the streets in this wretched state? Who would care about a sister from the back alleys? In everyone's indifference, the image of him calling out his sister's name vividly came to mind.

"My sister. My little sister. My everything..."

"Do you have any guesses? About where your sister was taken."

Gis raised his head. Though he had come seeking help because there was no one else to ask, even if they wanted to help, it was a situation where they would have to directly confront the Freeman organization that ruled the island.

Even being mages, it wasn't something that could guarantee their lives, so he thought it wouldn't be easy for them to grant his request. That's why he had pleaded with the resolve to throw away his life.

But Shirone was asking where his sister had been taken without even hesitating.

"Thank you! Really, thank you!"

Gis repeatedly bowed his head. This was about all he could express in terms of gratitude.

Amy, who had been watching that scene with displeasure, grabbed Gis's arm and pulled him up.

"That's enough. Just act like you normally do. You're being so sudden that we're the ones feeling strange. Let's go inside first. We'll talk while treating your wounds."

"B-but my sister..."

"Idiot! If we charge in recklessly just because we're in a hurry, we'll be the first ones to get hurt! If she was kidnapped on her way home, there's still plenty of time. We'll go even if we have to fly, so get treated first."

Amy supported Gis and opened the villa door. Though she was worried about the girl named Yuna, treating his wounds came first right now.

When Gis lay down on the bed, Tess undressed him. Having learned numerous combat support techniques, she could tell Gis's condition at a glance. From the pattern of bruises, his ribs were definitely injured.

Tess pressed various parts of Gis's body.

"Ugh! It, it hurts."

"Of course it hurts. You got beaten up like this. They really hit you mercilessly. Bear with it a little. I need to check your organs too."

Tess pressed down on Gis's stomach with all her strength. Organs protected by skin and muscle were difficult to check without pressing this roughly.

"Uuuuugh!"

Though it must have been excruciating pain, Gis desperately endured it. It was because he thought the treatment needed to finish even a little faster so he could go rescue Yuna.

"It's fortunate. Your ribs are cracked and the rest are simple bruises. Your organs are fine too. You're surprisingly sturdy."

Gis smiled bitterly. Though he couldn't fight, due to picking fights with numerous nobles, he was already seasoned when it came to getting beaten up.

While Tess applied compression with bandages, Gis explained the situation.

Considering Yuna's work hours and the time she returned home, the kidnapping time was estimated to be around 2 hours ago.

"They would have taken her to their hideout, so she probably hasn't arrived yet. But I'm not hoping to make it in time. I just... if only Yuna is alive..."

Amy cut off Gis's words.

"No, it's okay. Those guys will travel by carriage, so if we borrow horses and ride, we can definitely catch up. Where exactly is their hideout? It seems quite far from here."

"I've never been there myself. I heard it's in the north of the island, but I'm not sure even about that."

"No. That's probably right."

Shirone was certain that must be the hideout. The north of the island was a natural cliff. When they first came here, didn't they have to circumnavigate the island and dock at the southern port because of that?

Moreover, if it was the north, it was close to the Kergo autonomous zone, a place where the government's reach didn't extend. There was no better environment for use as a hideout.

"Good, then let's depart. Can you stay alone?"

Gis nodded. Even if his wounds worsened, he intended to send Shirone.

Still, the reason his expression was dark was because of the guilt of having dragged people who had nothing to do with this into mortal danger.

"Are you really okay? It's funny for me to say this after asking for help, but those guys are really strong."

Amy snorted. Even if it wasn't for Gis's sister, she had been planning to deal with that human called Falcoa someday.
