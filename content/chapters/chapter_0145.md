"Hmph, they're just thugs in the end. Don't worry about anything and just wait for us to come back."

Gis revealed what he knew. He didn't want to frighten them as they set off to rescue his sister, but if he let them go like this, he felt he wouldn't be able to bear the guilt on his conscience.

"Those bastards suddenly appeared and took control of the island in just three months. They're not a simple organization. According to what I heard from Falcoa's direct subordinate, before they came to the island, they seemed to be called the Parrot Bandit Group."

"The Parrot Bandit Group?"

Shirone's eyes widened greatly. Amy also seemed surprised for once and fell into thought.

If it was the Parrot Bandit Group, then it was the bandit group that the man named Lucas had belonged to—the one who had attacked the school together with Arcane.

Amy had witnessed that man Lucas's martial prowess. From the memories that surfaced as the effects of Abyss Nova wore off, he was a formidable enemy that even the combined attacks of Iruki and Nade couldn't handle.

If it hadn't been for Shiina's sudden intrusion, the safe evacuation of all the students would have been nothing but a dream.

In any case, knowing their identity didn't change the situation. With an innocent girl's life at stake, it was important to leave as quickly as possible.

"It's okay. We've fought and won against the vice-captain of the Parrot Bandit Group before."

Gis swallowed his tears and bit his molars.

"Thank you. To think you'd go this far for someone like me."

All the nobles Gis had met until now didn't even treat back-alley thugs as human beings.

Perhaps it was natural. Why would those who monopolized the world's wealth and fame pay any attention to humans living in the dark shadows?

But these people were different. They were willing to fight for him—someone who had only schemed to overcharge them with his shallow words.

"This kindness... I really don't know how to repay it."

Amy, made uncomfortable by Gis's continued gratitude, put her hands on her hips and sighed.

"I told you it's fine. When you think about it, you're the one who saved me. If anything, we're the ones who received help."

"But this kind of dangerous work..."

"There's no need to think about it so complicated. We're not strangers anymore. Besides, since you asked like a man, we're accepting your request."

Gis looked at Amy with a bewildered expression.

How could the word "manly" possibly fit this situation? Shouldn't it be the complete opposite?

"Tch, if you're going to pity me, then stop it. Manly, my ass. What kind of man in the world would beg so pathetically? My pride is completely crushed."

"What are you talking about? You threw away your pride and asked for help to get your sister back."

"Well, that's true, but..."

Amy smiled and gently pushed Gis's forehead.

"That's exactly what being a man is, you fool."

As Amy left those words behind and walked away, Gis felt a surge of emotion and tears threatened to spill. But he felt he had to hold them back. If he cried already, he thought it would pour cold water on their resolve.

Rian patted Gis's shoulder and followed behind Amy.

"Don't worry. Since you saved my friend, we'll definitely save your sister too."

Tess added:

"But when we come back, you better show us around properly. I'm going to collect my due for all this hard work."

Shirone looked back at Gis from the doorway and said:

"Trust us. We'll definitely bring your sister back safely."

In the end, Gis couldn't hold back his tears. Without even caring about the wounds wrapped in bandages, he ran to the door. And he shouted toward Shirone's group as they walked away:

"Be careful! You really have to be careful! If you don't come back safely, I'll never forgive you!"

Shirone's group didn't look back. But their gradually quickening footsteps were a more certain answer than a hundred words.

* * *

Shirone's group borrowed four horses from the western commercial district. It was Tess's opinion that if they chased in a carriage with poor mobility, they wouldn't be able to make it in time.

They had made bold promises to Gis, but the actual situation was turning unfavorable.

Most of all, learning the true identity of the Freeman organization so late weighed heavily on their minds.

Lucas, the vice-captain of the Parrot Bandit Group, was a B-class criminal.

The classification of criminals served not only as a measure of the severity of their crimes but also as a gauge of their combat power.

Even if someone was a serial killer who terrorized a city, if they were just a mentally unstable person without strong combat abilities, they wouldn't be imprisoned in Inferno, the western prison.

Shirone instinctively realized he had gotten involved in quite a serious matter.

Something was definitely strange. After the Arcane incident ended, he had heard that the leader of the Parrot Bandit Group was an A-class criminal currently wanted.

Then who exactly was Freeman of the Freeman organization they currently had to fight?

"Amy, is it really that Parrot Bandit Group? Don't you feel something's a bit strange?"

"I had the same thought. How could a wanted organization establish a base in a tourist destination? Especially when the pursuit of the Parrot Bandit Group must have intensified after the Arcane incident."

Tess, who was riding her horse to Amy's right, joined their conversation.

"It's not the Parrot Bandit Group."

"Huh? Do you know something?"

"The Parrot Bandit Group is probably a name that changed when they came over to the Kingdom of Tormia. Their original name is the Parrot Mercenary Group."

"Mercenary group? They were mercenaries? Then Lucas too?"

"I can't know about that. But I know how they became a bandit group."

"How so?"

Shirone immediately asked. But Tess was afraid to tell him.

Looking at the content alone, it was just a common, ordinary story. However, she thought that information about them might break Shirone's fighting spirit in this situation where they had to fight fiercely.

"Tess, if you know something, please tell us."

When even Amy couldn't contain her curiosity and requested, Tess had no choice but to begin explaining.

"There's one incident related to the Parrot Mercenary Group that was quite an issue on the continent. Do you guys know about the Flower Vase Incident that happened in the Iron Kingdom seven years ago?"

"Oh? I know about it. I heard about it at school."

What Shirone knew was this: At a noble gathering in the Iron Kingdom, Upper House noble Baltes proclaimed that if anyone could prove they had more courage than him, he would give them his precious flower vase.

Then Lower House noble Muse took up the challenge. The method he used was to throw the flower vase that had been offered as a reward against the wall.

On the surface, it seemed like a drunken mishap between nobles, but digging deeper revealed a long-festering political conflict.

"Iron's noble system is bicameral. The Upper House conveys the king's will and the Lower House represents the commoners. Thanks to this, Iron became a wealthy nation, but the conflict between nobles reached a serious level."

Involving commoners in politics weakened noble authority. But as the number of commoners with agency increased, the nation's wealth inevitably became more powerful.

"The Upper House's power comes from authority, and the Lower House's power comes from taxes. In the end, the fight between the two factions was already foreseeable. When Lower House noble Muse acted arrogantly, Baltes was furious inside. At the time it was glossed over, but the resentment must have remained."

"But what does that have to do with the Parrot Bandit Group—I mean, the Parrot Mercenary Group?"

"Three months after the Flower Vase Incident, civil war broke out in Muse's territory. An unidentified army invaded. From what I heard through intelligence, the one who started the civil war was Baltes. He hired mercenaries, not private soldiers, to attack Muse."

"Then don't tell me, the mercenaries who belonged there were..."

"That's right. They were the Parrot Mercenary Group. Of course, numerous mercenary groups participated, but the Parrot Mercenary Group demonstrated overwhelming power and broke through Muse's defensive walls. However, just as they were about to breach the inner castle, Baltes's private soldiers suddenly poured in from behind and ambushed the mercenary groups instead."

Shirone could imagine the situation at the time.

Hire mercenaries to attack the enemy, then use private soldiers to attack the mercenaries. That way, they could achieve both victory and innocence simultaneously.

"Baltes never intended to eliminate Muse from the beginning. The power of the Lower House, which had the support of the commoners, was stronger than expected. He just wanted to teach him a lesson. In the end, the mercenaries were disposable pawns from the start. Make them raid the territory, then eliminate them again—a perfect operation."

"But if it ended like that, the Lower House nobles wouldn't stay quiet either, would they?"

"Of course not, but they couldn't reveal it publicly. After all, the Upper House consisted of nobles under the king's protection. There was probably some agreement. The fact that Muse hasn't brought up that story even now, seven years later, is probably because he received some compensation from Baltes."

Rian, who had heard up to that point, frowned in displeasure.

"So only the mercenaries were abandoned? I can't understand politicians' thinking at all. It goes against chivalry."

"It's natural to think that way. But I've encountered many intelligence reports worse than this from my family. The world doesn't flow according to our thoughts alone."

Everyone fell silent at Tess's words. They would have to advance into places where the world's great forces operated someday. The Flower Vase Incident wasn't their affair, but it wasn't someone else's affair either.

"Anyway, they were abandoned like that. The mercenaries who had attacked Muse's territory were all executed under the name of treason, and naturally the Parrot Mercenary Group was also disbanded."

Amy said:

"But they survived in the end. That's why they came to the Kingdom of Tormia as refugees."

"Right. The mercenary group was disbanded, but a small number of skilled personnel escaped the battlefield. This is speculation from here on, but wouldn't it have been difficult for those branded as traitors to maintain a mercenary group? So they fell to becoming a bandit group, and when they were eventually branded as criminals, they drifted to this island."

Tess's reasoning was logical, but Shirone felt somehow uneasy.

Most of all, for those fleeing under charges of national treason to maintain the name "Parrot," they would need considerable capital, power, and an extremely capable leader.

"Maybe it's just the same name? Actually, there are countless guilds in the world, and the name 'Parrot' isn't unusual either."

Tess hesitated to answer. The situation she had worried about had finally come.

"Shirone, that woman you told us about before?"

"Huh? Sister Marsha?"

After rescuing Amy from the royal palace, when they were having a late-night snack, Shirone had briefly mentioned Marsha.

Of course, he hadn't revealed every detail.

Most of all, he planned to take the story of nearly suffering terrible treatment at the hands of his adoptive father to his grave.

"I also thought it was speculation when I heard Gis's words. But there's a reason it can't be. The name of the captain who led the Parrot Mercenary Group at that time came to mind."

"The captain's name? Isn't it Freeman?"

"Clay Marsha. That's the captain's name."

When Tess finally revealed it, Shirone's expression became blank. The affectionate Marsha who had been like an older sister and Captain Marsha of the mercenary group wouldn't properly connect in his mind.

"At first I thought they were just people with the same name. But when you said she was raised by mercenaries, I had a suspicion. Then when I heard Gis's words, I was certain. Those who rule this island are the remnants of the A-class mercenary group that was betrayed in the Iron Kingdom seven years ago."

"That can't be. How could Sister Marsha...? I explained it then. She's not the kind of person who would do bad things like this."

"Really?"

Tess stared at Shirone with intense eyes. She was different from her usual self. Those were the eyes of an intelligence agent who could see through human psychology.

"Do you really think so? About the Marsha you're thinking of?"

Shirone bit his lips. He actually knew. No matter how much he tried to trust her, his insight was already doubting everything.

"I'm sorry. You're probably right. Certainly... it seems like it."

When examined one by one, all the circumstances fit together. He could now understand her reaction when she talked about the collusion between nobles and criminals and smiled bitterly.
