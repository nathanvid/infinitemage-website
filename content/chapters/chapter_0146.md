Tess was actually more worried about Shirone's quick change of stance. She had experienced enough to know just how rationally he viewed the world.

Shirone wasn't someone who adjusted situations according to his mood. But that didn't make him cold-hearted either.

He simply knew how to control his emotions, though countless conflicts must be raging within his heart.

Tess believed that Shirone's current state could work against him in battle.

"Shirone, you don't need to worry about it. We're not going there to fightâ€”we're going to rescue Gis's sister. We can just see for ourselves what kind of person Marsha is."

Shirone forced a smile. He knew what Tess was worried about, but that only strengthened his resolve.

If the woman he confirmed with his own eyes was truly evil, he intended to forget all his previous emotions and give everything he had to defeat her.

"Don't worry. I won't make any mistakes."

Shirone spurred his horse's flanks and swiftly cut through the night air.

**Forced Breakthrough (1)**

There was no path from the west to the northern hideout. This was because the natives' autonomous zone lay in the center.

Those who had kidnapped Yuna took a wide detour around Mount Toa to reach their hideout. By the time they arrived at their destination, dawn was already breaking.

In a building as shabby as a warehouse, Falcoa sat in a chair. With his pupils half-dilated, he sat there in a daze, Loop shells he had chewed and spat out scattered at his feet.

The subordinates who entered through the warehouse door bowed to Falcoa, then threw the sack containing Yuna onto the floor.

There was a thudding sound, but no scream escaped. However, intense trembling could be felt from inside the sack.

Just from the convulsive shaking, one could tell how terrified she was.

When Falcoa gestured with his chin, a subordinate drew his knife and tore open the sack. Like opening a cocoon, Yuna appeared, soaked in tears and sweat.

Despair filled Yuna's eyes as she looked around in terror. Though she didn't know where she was, the time that had passed told her they had been traveling all night.

Before her, a man who didn't seem normal stared down at her with dilated pupils, while scary-looking men at the entrance blocked any escape route.

"P-please spare me."

"You guys get out."

The subordinates, who knew from experience what happened when they defied the boss's orders, disappeared through the door as soon as Falcoa gave the command.

Now alone with Yuna, Falcoa chewed on his Loop as he approached.

"Much better than I expected, aren't you? Do you know why you're here?"

"I-I don't know. Please send me home."

"Sorry, but that's not possible. I plan to make you the most miserable person in the world. Because your brother sold you out."

Yuna froze as if struck by lightning. But in her heart, she still believed in Gis. What kind of brother in the world would sell his sister to someone like this?

"That can't be true! My brother cares about me more than anyone!"

"Is that so? Then why are you here right now? I gave Gis something incredible and received you in return."

Falcoa didn't think his words were lies. After all, he had spared Gis's life, which was worth a fortune, wasn't it?

Moreover, he had even guaranteed time for Gis to miss Amy as a bonus, so calling himself Gis's benefactor wasn't an exaggeration.

"That can't be true! My brother would never sell me!"

Yuna clutched her chest and screamed, trying to overcome her fear. The fact that her brother had sold her was more shocking than being dragged to an unknown place.

"Send me to my brother! I'll meet him directly and ask!"

"Hey, little miss. You don't seem to grasp the situation. You can't go home. You can never go back for the rest of your life. You have two choices: die by my hand or take your own life."

"No! That can't be true! Kyaaah!"

Falcoa suddenly lunged forward and grabbed Yuna's wrist. When he pulled with irresistible strength, Yuna was forcibly lifted and held in Falcoa's arms.

"Get away, you bastard!"

After savoring the frail girl's resistance for a moment, Falcoa twisted Yuna's arm and spun her around. Then he gripped both her cheeks in his hands and threatened her.

"Don't exhaust yourself too early. You'll have plenty more occasions to scream ahead."

At that moment, the warehouse door opened and someone entered. A cold voice quietly filled the warehouse.

"Falcoa. Human trafficking violates our code."

"Freeman."

Falcoa frowned in displeasure. Agado Freeman, the only man in the Parrot Bandits who ranked higher than himself, was watching the warehouse situation with sunken eyes.

Over 190 centimeters tall and wearing a white long coat, his appearance was pallor itself. His eyebrows were completely shaved off, and his lips were pale like a sick person's.

As a figure who had served as vice-leader of the Parrot Bandits, the predecessor of the Freeman organization, he was a master of Schema and used techniques involving magic bullets. However, the established belief within the organization was that he could overwhelm Lucas through physical ability alone.

"What's this sudden visit? You haven't shown your face until now. Did you run out of money?"

Falcoa spoke with obvious displeasure. Since the Parrot Bandits era, Freeman had been the undisputed second-in-command, but Falcoa was the only one granted a free role within the organization.

The conflict between the vice-leader and action captain had worsened since entering the island. This was due to Freeman's desire to maintain the old mercenary band's regulations even after they had fallen to the level of bandits.

Feeding dozens of subordinates branded as traitors required enormous funds. However, Freeman had no particular solution to offer for this.

The person who had led such an organization for five years was Falcoa. He had forcibly driven out the island's natives and maintained the organization with funds earned from distributing Loop.

Freeman had allowed Falcoa's misdeeds despite knowing about them for these reasons.

But this time had gone too far. If they bore the name of Parrot, there were lines that shouldn't be crossed.

Freeman was merely a figurehead leader, but he maintained a firm policy of decisively punishing human trafficking and violence-based plunder.

"You should know the organization's code, shouldn't you? Human trafficking is conduct that degrades the Parrot Bandits' status."

"Parrot Bandits? Since when have we lived looking only at past glory? Look at this state we're in. Do you think the organization would have lasted this long without the money I bring in?"

"You've lost it, Falcoa. I'll praise the work you've done for the organization regardless of methods. But understand this clearly: I am definitely the one leading this organization."

"I don't care about that stuff. I don't acknowledge you. That's what we agreed on from the start, wasn't it? You can't start acting like the big boss now."

Chilling murderous intent rose from Freeman as he watched Falcoa's defiant attitude. It was an intense aura that could kill weak creatures through exposure alone.

However, Falcoa absorbed that murky energy as if stabbing himself with a knife. Though it was painful, he endured it without changing his expression at all.

"Heh heh heh, oh my, how scary."

Freeman was troubled. For such a belligerent human, pain and anger were merely catalysts that worsened the situation.

'Has he become this much of a wild dog?'

Even without Loop, Falcoa had always been someone driven purely by desire. It was just that those desires were focused on combat and killing, which had suited the mercenary band.

But now, running a tavern on the island, he was in a state of frustration. Even indulging in Loop, alcohol, and women wasn't enough to satisfy his instinctive madness.

"P-please spare me, please."

When Yuna trembled and pleaded, Freeman looked at her, then turned his gaze back to Falcoa.

"Do you really have to go this far? Have you now abandoned even Parrot's pride?"

"Pride? Hey, shall I tell you something? The Parrot Bandits are already finished. The leader left, and the subordinates are at their limit too. You should give up and come over to this side."

Falcoa ostentatiously buried his face in Yuna's nape. Even so, Freeman didn't move. Now Falcoa was also revealing murderous intent.

The moment he moved, battle would begin. If that happened, one of the two pillars that had supported Parrot would inevitably collapse in some way.

In a proper fight, no one could predict the outcome. However, Falcoa was confident because he knew Freeman couldn't do anything to him.

"How about you just leave? I'll tell my subordinates, so take some money. You'd better learn to acknowledge reality and enjoy yourself."

"Oh my, what a complete mess this is, a complete mess."

The door opened and a woman's voice was heard. At the voice that pierced his heart, Falcoa hastily turned his head. But before he could put anything into his gaze, he took a punch to the jaw and his face turned.

"Kugh!"

A powerful kick then struck Falcoa's abdomen. As Falcoa fell backward onto the floor, Yuna also lost strength in her legs and collapsed.

"Damn. What rotten luck."

Falcoa spat and slowly stood up. The reason he, with his animal-like reflexes, couldn't avoid two attacks was because he had unconsciously suppressed his counterattack.

Clay Marsha. The leader of the Parrot Bandits, who had once ruled over hundreds of mercenaries, stood there.

"Is it really the leader?"

"Are there fake leaders too? This mutt's gone crazy after a few years of freedom."

Falcoa wasn't angry. No, far from being angry, he didn't even show hostility.

To members of the mercenary band, Marsha was that kind of existence.

As the first leader of the Parrot Bandits, raising the mercenary band to A-rank within a few years required more than just force.

And Marsha had accomplished this through excellent skill. Moreover, she was powerful enough to be the only one in the organization registered as an A-rank criminal.

But Falcoa didn't follow Marsha for such trivial reasons.

He defined the woman named Marsha like this:

A fallen saint.

Marsha was kind and affectionate, but among the masses of humanity she embraced, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say almost none were normal.

Those abandoned by family, those born with an innate thirst for blood, social outcasts who had no way to reveal their existence except on battlefields.

Falcoa was one of them.

When no one would treat his mental illness and only tried to push him outside society, Marsha was the only person who embraced him.

In the Parrot Bandits, Marsha was both sister and mother, the supreme leader they could trust and rely on in any situation.

But even with such a leader, the frustration was real. Not a single contact in years, and now she appears and causes this commotion?

"Damn it. Where the hell have you been hiding? You're not even the leader anymore. All this time we've been..."

"You became a drug addict, didn't you?"

Falcoa's face hardened. Even his dilated pupils became somewhat clearer in this moment.

He must have heard those words countless times over five years, but somehow it felt like hearing them for the first time.

Drug addict. Was that really the case? Had he, once called the demon of battlefields, now become a drug addict?

Freeman approached and bowed to Marsha.

"It's been a long time, Leader. When did you return?"

"I left as soon as I heard Lucas was taken down. He'll definitely spill about our hideouts. We'll probably need to clean up this place soon too."

After explaining to Freeman, Marsha approached Falcoa. As she came closer, Falcoa, feeling guilty, subtly averted his gaze.

"Falcoa, I told you clearly. Human trafficking is forbidden."

Falcoa's brow furrowed. Thinking about it, there was nothing to be ashamed of. All the fault lay with Marsha, who had abandoned the organization and left.
