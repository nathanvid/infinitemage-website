She knew the Magic Association was tracking her. But how could she not send word even once? If she hadn't taught her subordinates the taste of money, the organization would have already fallen apart.

"Don't talk nonsense! You're not in a position to order me around, are you? We're neither the Parrot Bandits nor mercenaries. We're just a gang of thugs stuck on an island!"

"So... you're going to act like a scoundrel to the very end?"

"Hmph! I earned it! I earned it and kept this organization together! Instead of praise, you blame me? Then what have you been doing all this time?"

"That's not something you need to worry about. If you won't follow the discipline I established, then abandon the name Parrot right now."

"Hahaha! Is that supposed to be a threat? Fine, I'll abandon it! Parrot? We're the Freeman organization now! Ever since you ran away, we haven't even used the Parrot name!"

"Good. From this moment on, you are not a Parrot. I don't know how much you've earned, but scrape it all together and leave this place."

"Damn it!"

Falcoa burst out in furious rage. Even if it was Marsha, she couldn't come at him like this. It might be her Parrot organization, but his blood was mixed in too. The honor of being the strongest mercenary group wasn't something that could be traded for mere money.

"If you can't give up Parrot, then follow my words. I won't tell you to live righteously. But if you want something, fight for it and take it. I cannot tolerate extorting from the weak."

Falcoa gritted his teeth. He was furious at Marsha for exploiting him even though she knew he couldn't leave Parrot.

"I always get what I want. You're the same way. Someday you'll be mine too."

Rather than getting angry, Marsha smiled gently as if soothing a troublesome child.

"How refreshing to hear that after so long. Anyway, do your best. I'm the type who doesn't stop men who come and doesn't hold back men who leave."

Falcoa clenched his fists and glared at Marsha. It was as if his eyes had caught fire.

He was actually using a powerful eye technique. But Marsha's expression didn't even change. It showed just how strong her mental power was.

"Tch! Still as unpleasant as ever. I'm done. I'm going out to drink."

"Stay put at the hideout. We're having a meeting with squad leaders and above. And from this moment, drugs are banned. If you get caught using them, know that you'll really die by my hand."

Falcoa didn't even answer and left the warehouse. But Marsha knew. He would attend the meeting and wouldn't touch drugs. The person who would take him to battlefields overflowing with blood had returned.

After the subordinates disappeared, Freeman returned to Marsha not as a vice-leader but as a hometown friend, greeting her anew.

"I'm glad you returned safely. I was worried when we couldn't contact you."

"Of course you can't contact me when I'm running away. Don't you think? Did you think I'd be easily caught? By the way, what happened to Falcoa? Is he even useful in that state? He used to fly around when he held a sword, even if he was crazy."

"You can't blame only Falcoa. We're the ones who took the battlefield away from him."

"Hehe, no, that would be me."

"Still, we've managed to raise war funds thanks to him. We've prepared so we can leave for another country whenever you return."

Marsha puffed out her cheeks as if displeased. She knew how Falcoa had been bringing in funds.

In the end, are humans beings who can only adapt to reality? The prestige of the Parrot Bandits who used to rampage fearlessly was now a thing of the past.

It was a mercenary group she had built with Freeman, her hometown friend, since leaving home at seventeen.

She had fallen for politicians' schemes and lost her life's foundation, but she had wanted to preserve Parrot's value.

But now, weren't they no different from others? They would use any means necessary to make money, and before fighting for their beliefs, they had to watch the faces of those with power.

"Sigh, when did we become like this?"

"We were betrayed by the state itself. We have no choice but to live this way."

"Yes, I suppose so. But Freeman, surely you haven't been corrupted too?"

Freeman closed his mouth. His conscience wasn't bothered. He was just hurt to be suspected by the friend he had admired since childhood.

"The organization means nothing to me. The name Parrot has no value either. I only wish for your safety."

Marsha shuddered with chills. Anyone wearing the Parrot badge would know Freeman's feelings, even a dog. It wasn't particularly touching, yet she was sick to death of how he always appealed to her this way.

"You only wish for my safety? Why on earth?"

"You are..."

When Marsha asked knowingly to rebuke him, Freeman pondered among the many words floating in his head to find the right ones.

"Because you are our leader."

Marsha snorted. After hearing the answer, it seemed Freeman was nothing to worry about. His annoying personality remained the same as always.

'Anyway, now that I'm back, I need to reorganize.'

Marsha planned to lead the organization to exile in another country for a fresh start. To do that, she first needed to clean up the mess her subordinates had scattered around.

"Sob! *Sob*"

Marsha turned her head at the weeping sound. Yuna was crying pitifully, unable to even think of escaping.

Though she had avoided something terrible, Marsha could fully understand. Women were sensitive enough to be wounded just by the fact that some unknown man had handled them roughly.

"What happened? Where did you bring this girl from?"

"There's a street tout among Falcoa's men. She's supposedly that guy's sister."

"That crazy bastard. Now he's even going after his subordinate's sister?"

"I don't know. He seemed completely unhinged."

"Really? Is there some situation I don't know about?"

Freeman told her what he had heard from his subordinates. From the incident between Gis and Amy, through Shirone's assault on the royal palace, to the circumstances that led to bringing Yuna.

Marsha, who had been listening with interest, lit up when Shirone's story came up.

"Oh, now I see it's a story I know too?"

"You know it? How do you know about this incident?"

Marsha smiled and touched her lips.

"I really am a genius. Life is such that everything gets entangled this way in the end."

"What on earth happened? Tell me."

"Oh, it's... just a minor incident. No need to worry about it."

If Marsha wouldn't tell him, Freeman had no intention of pressing further. Her habit of stirring things up here and there when bored wasn't new. Moreover, that way of living was her only escape route for surviving in this world.

Marsha received numerous agenda items from Freeman.

There were no particularly troublesome issues. The funds Falcoa had earned were sufficient for a fresh start in another country, and Freeman's unit hadn't declined much in combat capability.

"Not bad. Good work. But shouldn't we just dispose of the assets?"

"Does Falcoa's accumulated funds bother you that much?"

"A little... you know? At a time when we're making Parrot's comeback, starting by raising the organization with money earned from selling drugs."

"That's not like you. Money is money anyway. I don't like the way it was earned either. But burying money over something like that is what children do."

"I know. Anyway, let's discuss this agenda item at the meeting later. For now..."

At that moment, the door burst open and a member entered. Marsha and Freeman looked at him with puzzled expressions.

This was a remote area beyond the government's reach. Therefore, there should be no reason to run here gasping for breath.

Marsha smiled and said:

"What's wrong? Got a stomachache? There's no bathroom here."

"Huh? Leader? You've returned?"

The member who discovered Marsha couldn't hide his surprise. But the situation was urgent, so without time for pleasantries, he immediately made his report.

"Leader! Big trouble! We're under attack!"

"Attack? Suddenly what attack? Is it the government?"

"I don't think so. They're kids, a group of four. According to reports, it seems to be 2 mages and 2 swordsmen."

Just from hearing that much, Marsha figured out who it was. It was certainly strange that they would come to rescue the street tout's sister they had fought at the port, but Marsha couldn't deny one possibility.

"Hehe, well, if it's that disgusting brat, it's certainly possible. By any chance, isn't there someone named Shirone among the attacking kids?"

"I'm sorry. I don't really know the names either..."

Freeman had already changed his tone to speak respectfully.

"Leader, how about we just hand over the woman? From the standpoint of organizing the group, causing a disturbance seems like a bothersome matter."

Thinking that such an upright man was rare, Marsha analyzed the situation.

"Hmm, hand over the woman. Isn't that rather pathetic? Kidnapping someone and then returning her when they come looking. Or what, are you saying they might actually attack this place?"

"That won't happen. While you were away, I thoroughly fortified this place. The tactical aspects utilizing magic circles and magical tools are perfect. Unless they're considerable experts, they'll die before even reaching the first checkpoint."

"Then it doesn't matter, right? Go kill them. I'll take care of this girl. Did giving you a few years' rest make you lose your edge? You've become completely clueless."

As soon as Marsha finished speaking, Freeman immediately ordered his subordinate to prepare for deployment.

Showing a lack of discipline in front of the leader was shameful in itself. He felt especially wronged since he thought he had prepared well.

"All forces to training positions. This is a real combat situation."

"Yes! I'll relay that immediately!"

Freeman's subordinates moved like clockwork. It took less than 5 minutes to gather weapons, form units, and head to their respective positions.

Only then did Marsha smile with satisfaction and lean back in her chair.

"You did work pretty hard after all. I thought you'd just been playing around all this time."

"Everyone was waiting for this day. They're working harder because you've returned."

"Hmph, how long do I have to spoon-feed you and even burp you? It's time you learned to do things on your own. By the way, what about you? Aren't you going to fight?"

"I'm staying here. Protecting you is what I must do."

Marsha looked up at Freeman with an incredulous expression. Of course, as an early member of the mercenary group, he had served as a bodyguard before. But each time, Marsha had to suppress the goosebumps rising on her arms.

"You're really so pathetic I can't stand it. Do you think I'd find you attractive for acting like this?"

Freeman seemed to have already made up his mind and had no intention of leaving Marsha's side.

Marsha's face reddened with anger. She had hated this aspect of him since childhood. He couldn't express emotions and was stubborn as a mule, which had annoyed her countless times.

"Hey! Don't just stand there stupidly, get out! Do you think you're my husband or something?"

Still sitting in her chair, Marsha lifted her leg and kicked Freeman in the butt.

Then, as if caught by inertia, Freeman took a step forward and moved his body. Maintaining silence to the end, he quietly left the warehouse.

After everyone left, Marsha stretched with a refreshed smile as if nothing had happened.

While she was indeed excited about combat after so long, what made her more curious was Shirone.

Shirone belonged to the type Marsha despised most. There was no one in the world who could truly embrace another's pain.

Her adoptive father had eventually shown his true nature too. The mercy he had shown to an orphan was actually the manifestation of ugly desires, and when Marsha realized this truth, she awakened.
