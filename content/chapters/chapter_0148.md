"Hehe, I do hope he makes it this far though. Don't you think so, Yuna? I'm dying to see what expression that little brat will make when he sees me."

"Please spare me. Please send me home."

Yuna knelt before Marsha, pleading. Just from the subordinates' attitudes, it was clear she was the organization's number one.

"It's okay, don't be scared."

"Then will you send me home?"

"Of course. It's chaotic outside right now, so I'll send you back once everything's settled. Speaking of which, could your big sister ask you for just one favor?"

"Huh? What kind of favor?"

Marsha approached Yuna and stroked her hair. Gradually, Yuna's eyes began to close as her focus started to blur.

"Huh? Huh?"

Yuna didn't even realize she was closing her eyes. A ringing sound echoed in her eardrums, and before she knew it, she lost consciousness.

Catching Yuna as she was about to fall forward, Marsha looked down at her tenderly, then turned her head with a cold smile.

"Hehe, now we're going to start a fun little game."

* * *

Falcoa's subordinates were rough and violent. As if fear didn't exist for them at all, they shrugged off mediocre attacks with their bodies while wildly swinging their swords.

"Attack with lightning formation! Charge!"

Their main attack strategy was guerrilla warfare. They took turns in a zigzag pattern, alternating offense and defense to distribute their stamina - a terrifying level for Shirone's group, who had no experience with war.

However, the essence of guerrilla warfare wasn't surprise attacks but retreat. The bastards seemed to have no intention of engaging in frontal combat.

"Release lightning formation! Retreat for now!"

"Where do you think you're running!"

Amy hastily fired Flame Strikes in rapid succession. At that moment, the enemies' bodies glowed and transformed into flashes of light, shooting up into the sky. High-pitched sounds of tearing air decorated the heavens.

"Ugh, how annoying! We missed them again."

As Amy stamped her foot in frustration, Rian placed his hand on her shoulder to comfort her.

"But the enemies are also going all out. Their numbers are increasing, so Yuna should be safe for now. That's good for us."

Shirone looked around at his friends and said, "Let's assess our situation first. Anyone injured?"

Injuries had to be confirmed visually. In a neighborhood brawl, you'd notice even a bloody nose, but in life-or-death combat, too much endorphin is released to counter adrenaline, making it possible not to feel pain.

Only after the four checked each other's physical condition did they realize there were no significant problems and breathed a sigh of relief.

But the enemies had taken no damage either. No matter how hard they pressed their attack, at the crucial moments, they would escape like ghosts.

"We haven't taken down a single one so far. This could work against us in future battles."

Amy shared the facts she had analyzed.

"I've been watching, and there's probably a secret in those bracelets they're wearing. They must be magic devices that activate spatial movement."

Shirone wore a skeptical expression as he asked, "Is that even possible? It's different from magic bullets. Spatial movement is magic that transports the mage. Without a Spirit Zone, you can't set a destination, let alone activate it at all."

Amy had questions about that too. But strictly speaking, it wasn't completely impossible.

"Maybe... it could be linked to magic circles."

Magic circles are formulas that engrave special images in space, making them emit magical power on their own. Therefore, by borrowing the power of magic circles, even non-mages could use magic.

"Of course, you can't cast spatial movement with magic tools. But if you link it with magic circles recorded at specific locations, it's theoretically possible."

Shirone, who understood the concept of magic, nodded. But Tess was concerned about something else.

"Is that possible for a fallen mercenary band? From what I know, magic circles require enormous manpower and funding. Plus, spatial movement is high-level magic, isn't it?"

"Right. It's probably intermediate-level magic circles. To draw just one magic circle requires the labor of at least five mages working all day. But these guys could manage it. Falcoa has a monopoly on Loop. The mercenaries we met at the ruins said the same thing. The profit margin on Loop is enormous. Ultimately, they sold drugs to fortify their base. That would explain this entire situation."

"Just how much did those bastards make selling drugs? One magic circle wouldn't be enough for this kind of range, would it?"

Tess's point was valid. Based on her question, Shirone reviewed all their battles so far.

The first battle took place in a valley where the enemies first fled. There was also a retreat in the forest, and here again they used spatial movement.

"Considering the distance we need to travel, I think there are at least hundreds of magic circles drawn."

"H-hundreds?"

Tess's mouth hung open. Intermediate magic circles that require five mages working all day - if there were hundreds of them, just how much gold had been scattered across this land?

"Surely they didn't waste money to that extent? Based on distance alone, dozens would be sufficient. If there really are hundreds of magic circles laid out, we'd never be able to catch them under any circumstances."

At that moment, Tess realized something from her own words and slapped her palm.

"Ah! That's it!"

"Right. Now you understand? Just like you said, they've made it impossible to catch them under any circumstances. They've networked the entire northern forest. Fighting like this, we who are outnumbered will tire first. We'll collapse before even reaching the summit."

Their resentment toward those who sold drugs to strengthen their base grew stronger. But now was the time to coldly devise solutions rather than be driven by emotion.

"So what do we do now? How about erasing the magic circles as we go? If the enemies run away no matter where we fight, rushing in recklessly won't solve anything."

Amy shook her head. Tess's opinion was reasonable, but other problems remained.

"It's difficult. Magic circles are records engraved in space. So to remove them, you don't just erase the drawing - you have to devastate that space. Doing hundreds like that could take days."

Finally understanding the situation, Tess bit her lip. When a small group faces a large one, it's important to somehow reduce their numbers. But the bastards had blocked that method in advance.

Contrary to expectations, Shirone raised his hand in favor of Tess's opinion.

"No, it's worth trying. Let's erase at least one."

"You want to try? Erasing one out of hundreds won't change anything."

"That's from our perspective, but their thinking might be different. If they put so much effort into building a network, wouldn't they consider even the loss of one magic circle precious? Maybe they'll swarm to defend that spot."

"Ah, I see! Advanced psychological warfare!"

Tess quickly caught on to Shirone's strategy. War is often called a power game played with money, but the side with superior funding isn't always the winner. Human psychology plays a complex role in warfare.

The more you have to protect, the weaker your psychology becomes. For example, even if you spend 100 gold to train one elite soldier, it's all for nothing if you can't use them.

Such situations actually occur in war.

There were countless cases where people poured money into war preparations, but then couldn't deploy their elite soldiers because they were too precious, ultimately having their castles fall to cheap soldiers.

Amy analyzed Shirone's strategy. If you can't chase the enemies, then draw them to you instead. It was indeed the most viable strategy in this situation. But that didn't solve the original problem.

"This time we need to consider efficiency. Actually, I didn't mention it because I thought magic circle destruction wasn't really an option, but neutralizing magic circle effects is much more complicated than you're thinking."

Rian gripped his straight sword in reverse and drove it forcefully into the ground.

"Can't I just churn up the earth with my sword? Until the magic circle completely disappears."

"That won't even come close. The magic circles we see with our eyes are just symbols that implement concepts."

Shirone, grasping what Amy wanted to say, provided a clear definition.

"You mean the concept of the magic circle won't disappear unless you destroy it enough to erase the space itself?"

"Exactly. So there are two main ways to destroy magic circles. Either neutralize the concept itself with Clear magic, or smash the magic circle until the concept breaks down. We can't do the former, and the latter requires time."

Tess realized why Amy had doubts about this method.

"So it comes down to this - the labor required to destroy one magic circle is less efficient than just pushing forward recklessly?"

"Right. Unless we can destroy it within 10 minutes, I think it's better to just go to our destination in this state. Of course, the basic idea of using the enemies' psychology is good thinking."

Once all the information needed for the strategy was shared, conversation actually decreased. In such cases, it was better to follow one person's opinion. Rian looked at Shirone, asking his intention.

"What do you want to do, Shirone?"

Shirone was also inevitably conflicted. With a hostage captured, it would be better to go as quickly as possible, but being too greedy about that could risk failing the rescue mission entirely.

"Let's destroy a magic circle. I'll try it."

When Shirone finally made his decision and voiced his thoughts, Amy looked at him with surprise.

Shirone, whose strength was insight, wasn't the type to be bound by probability, but he didn't completely ignore odds either. In her estimation, the probability of destroying a magic circle within 10 minutes was less than 10 percent.

"Are you sure you'll be okay? You don't have any magic that can do it in time, do you?"

Among the magic Shirone currently used, the most powerful was undoubtedly Photon Cannon. But the degree of giving mass to light was insufficient to handle the weight of the earth.

Of course, if he fired in rapid succession at ultra-high speed, he might be able to destroy one within 10 minutes. However, the mental strength exhausted by that would certainly make future battles disadvantageous.

Another possibility was laser, but Amy was skeptical about that too.

Magic that locally concentrates energy to cause molecular vibration had the advantage of destroying matter regardless of durability, but its range was inevitably limited.

"I'll try it. I have an idea."

Amy couldn't imagine how he planned to destroy the magic circle, but now it was best to follow Shirone's words. Shirone's insight, which intuitively calculated various variables, was rarely wrong.

To reach a more accurate conclusion would require someone like Iruki, but since he wasn't here, if Shirone's prediction was off, it would have to be considered force majeure.

Having reached that conclusion, Amy nodded and said, "Alright. Then Tess and I will move as one team, and Shirone and Rian as another team. Keep a 50-meter distance between us. Let's search the area with teleportation. We're looking for magic circles."

"Got it. But be careful. If you only focus on maintaining distance, you might collide with other cover. Teleporting through the forest is dangerous."

Even Shirone, a specialist in teleportation, needed high concentration to cross through forests. But Amy spoke curtly, as if Shirone's concern was unpleasant.

"Who are you worrying about right now? You're not thinking of me the same as those supernatural whatever kids, are you?"

It was meant to reduce Shirone's worry, but it wasn't exactly wrong either. Amy was also a graduating class student who had mastered the unbridgeable bridge, and with Insight on top of that, accidental collisions were almost impossible.
