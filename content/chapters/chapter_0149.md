Just as they were about to begin their operation in earnest, Tess, who had been lost in thought for a moment, suddenly spoke up.

"Wait. There's something I need to confirm before we leave."

"Huh? Confirm what?"

"If this operation succeeds, there's a high chance we'll face the enemies in full combat. So there's something I want to confirm with Rian."

"What is it? Is there some problem with me?"

Rian looked puzzled. Then Tess turned to look at him with an unusually serious gaze and asked.

"Rian, have you ever killed anyone?"

The surroundings fell as quiet as death. Rian just blinked while wearing his sword.

Honestly, he had never thought about such a thing. No, was it something he necessarily had to think about?

Every knight vaguely makes such resolutions. A sword is a tool for cutting people. If one had the resolve to wield such a tool for life, he thought there was no need to worry about other secondary matters.

"No, I haven't. Have you?"

"A few times. When I went bandit hunting with my father."

"I see. But what's the problem with that?"

"Rian, being prepared to die and being prepared to kill are completely different. It might be the same for mages, but especially for us, we have to cut people down with our own hands."

The enemies Shirone's group would face weren't neighborhood thugs. They were the Parrot Bandits, who had made a name for themselves in foreign countries. All of them were professionals who had experienced countless wars.

"Of course, I trust your courage. It wouldn't make sense for a swordsman to never bloody his blade in his lifetime. But if today is your first time, you might waver during combat."

Rian let out a thoughtful breath and pondered.

Wavering during combat. Of course, cutting people down wasn't particularly pleasant. But on the other hand, he felt it didn't matter at all.

"Tess, murder is a dangerous and complex matter. So I understand your concern. But I will absolutely never waver."

"You fool, I'm saying it's not that easy. Killing a person is...!"

"I've always been killing."

Tess's gaze wavered. Rian looked at his reflection in his straight sword and continued.

"And... I've died countless times as well."

At that moment, Rian looked back at Tess with intense eyes.

"When they said I had no talent, when they told me to give up the sword, even when I really wanted to give up, I swung my sword. In that process, I killed countless enemies and died to countless enemies."

Rian's straight sword pointed north. If Rian were a statue, he would have fallen forward under the weight of the sword, but he stood motionless as if roots had grown from his legs.

"Tess, do you understand? Throughout my life, I've never held a sword with half-hearted resolve. Whether there were enemies before my eyes or not, I always swung my sword desperately."

Everyone could read the resolve contained in Rian's words. As if nothing had happened, Rian smiled and sheathed his straight sword behind his back.

"I absolutely will not waver. I am Shirone's sword. I will only cut through to achieve what Shirone desires. So there's no need to worry."

This was itâ€”the reason Tess had chosen Rian over countless others with talent for the sword.

Rian was insensitive. That's why he couldn't even open his Schema. But human resolve born from the weight of life itself wasn't something that could be produced through talent or skill.

After watching Rian for a while, Tess smiled with satisfaction and looked around at everyone.

"Good! Now my worries have disappeared. Let's begin then."

At Tess's words, Shirone and Amy also fired up. Rian's words had stirred their fighting spirit.

"Then Amy, we'll go first."

Shirone grabbed Rian and cast photonization magic. With a flash of light, the two disappeared into the forest, and Amy and Tess immediately followed.

The sight of two streams of light passing through the dense forest was the epitome of dazzling beauty. Like reflections in a mirror, they traversed the forest with irregular movements, alternating between acute and obtuse angles.

They didn't know the location of the magic circles, but calculating the enemies' movement patterns gave them a rough estimate of the distance.

After wandering through the forest for about 10 minutes, they found the location of the first magic circle.

Since magic circles were also magical entities, they could clearly sense their presence once they entered the radius of a Spirit Zone.

Of course, if stealth magic was applied, the difficulty of detection would reach extreme levels. But even the wealthiest mercenary group couldn't afford to maintain such equipment.

Even combining all the mages involved in intermediate magic circles wouldn't amount to one-tenth the cost of hiring a stealth mage, so ultimately, it would be unprofitable business.

When Rian cut through the dense bushes with his straight sword to clear a path, they could see a magic circle drawn in a grassy clearing.

Shirone, seeing an actual magic circle for the first time, was surprised by its much larger scale than he had imagined.

Amy looked around and nodded.

"As expected, it's an intermediate magic circle. They must have really struggled to create this."

The magic circle, with a radius exceeding 5 meters, was emitting a red light as if responding to the Spirit Zone.

The various sized circles spread like ripples inside contained beautiful diagrams that could be considered works of art.

"Wait. Let me examine this."

Amy, who had gained some knowledge in the graduating class, carefully studied the magic circle.

Magic circle evaluation could be divided into three main categories.

First was the color indicating the intensity of magical power. Second was the integration density of functions. Third was the connectivity of the magic circles drawn inside.

From Amy's perspective, this magic circle was somewhat lacking in color and integration density, but its connectivity was excellent. This meant there was a high possibility that they had borrowed the power of an official organization.

"Phew, this has become troublesome. It seems like it was inscribed by a formally registered magic company. I thought they would have hired underground mages with their illegally earned money."

"Is that an important issue?"

"The characteristic of official companies is that they design according to standard practices, so connectivity is good. In other words, the magic circle's durability is high. Even so, is it really possible within 10 minutes?"

"We should at least try. Actually, I'm not sure if we can succeed."

"What? You're saying that now? This operation was executed because you said you had an idea."

"Sorry. But I have some confidence. And if we succeed..."

"If we succeed?"

Shirone looked up for a moment and calculated in his head, then revealed a rough estimate.

"Maybe we can destroy it in 1 minute instead of 10."

"What? 1 minute?"

Amy's eyes widened like saucers. This was an intermediate magic circle. Without a professional dismantling team, neutralizing a magic circle within 1 minute was nearly impossible.

Magic circles inscribed by official companies had durability as their advantage. Therefore, even if one cast powerful physical magic to crush the ground to gravel size, there was a possibility that the concept wouldn't disappear.

Amy thought they would need to grind the ground to at least the size of beans, but she knew Shirone didn't have magic capable of such power.

"Just how do you plan to do it? Are you certain? Destroying it halfway won't be effective. No, rather, if that happens, the magic circle might decompose and become even more troublesome."

"I see. Let me try first."

Amy grew increasingly anxious. From the response, it was clear he hadn't thought that far ahead.

Could he really do it? If they failed here, they would have wasted time for nothing.

Shirone positioned himself in the center of the magic circle. Amy, who had expected him to attack vertically from the sky considering the power involved, tilted her head at the unexpected sight.

"What are you planning to do from there? Can you create an impact from that position?"

"Yes. But since this is my first attempt, it might be dangerous. Stay outside the radius."

Following Shirone's words, the three stepped back.

Though anxious, their anticipation was no less. If they succeeded, they could instantly reverse the unfavorable situation.

As the magic circles were destroyed, the enemies' activity radius would gradually narrow.

Since their side had two mages, they were far superior in firepower, making it possible to end battles with lightning speed.

Shirone closed his eyes and took a deep breath. With his legs spread, he slowly bent at the waist and aimed his fist at the ground.

There was no immediately visible change. The atmosphere was so peaceful that one might wonder if it was acceptable to be so relaxed on a fierce battlefield.

But Amy was different.

Her eyes, which had initially watched Shirone skeptically, were now filled with shock, and her shoulders were trembling.

"Shirone, you..."

Tess looked at Amy strangely. Clearly, nothing was visible to her eyes, but Amy's face was pale as if she had seen a monster.

"Amy, what's wrong? What is Shirone doing right now?"

"I never thought he would use that... No, come to think of it, there was such a method."

"What on earth is it? I'm curious, so please explain."

"We should move farther away. That could be really dangerous."

As Amy stepped back, Rian and Tess followed her to relocate.

Even during this, the swordsmen felt puzzled. The distance Amy had moved back was more than double the distance they had retreated earlier.

"Now explain. What exactly do you see?"

"I'm not seeing it, I'm feeling it. The changes happening to Shirone."

"You feel it? What do you feel?"

"Spirit Zone. Right now, Shirone's Spirit Zone is moving at tremendous speed."

Even as Amy spoke, she couldn't believe it. How powerful must one's durability be for a Spirit Zone to repeat expansion and contraction this rapidly?

'It's definitely mental pulsation. But it's too fast. At this level, it's at least at Teacher Etela's level.'

The mental pulsation Amy was currently sensing from Shirone exceeded 10 beats per second.

But Shirone couldn't be satisfied with this alone.

The score he had achieved in Class Five's mental pulsation test was 410 points. He had once achieved 30 seconds at 13.6 beats per second.

Then he thought he needed to be at least twice as fast as that. Because the radius was different.

If the maximum expansion radius was 20 meters in diameter back then, currently 5 metersâ€”the magic circle's diameterâ€”was sufficient. As the round-trip distance shortened, the pulsation speed should naturally increase.

The question was whether his mental strength could endure it.

'I have no choice. Let me control it more precisely.'

As Shirone slightly furrowed his brow, Amy, who immediately felt the change, spoke with a trembling voice.

"My goodness. It's getting even faster."

As the radius narrowed, the mental pulsation frequency began to exceed 15 beats per second.

Knowing it's impossible to count from 1 to 15 in one second gives an idea of how fast this speed was.

An ordinary mage's mind would have collapsed before reaching this point.

But Shirone's durability using Vajra was currently at an unrivaled level.

Finally, the maximum expansion radius of the Spirit Zone aligned with the magic circle's perimeter. The remaining process was to cast magic while maintaining the current rhythm.

To endure the double burden of mental pulsation and magic casting required extreme concentration. Shirone gritted his teeth and attempted the ultimate magic he had only conceived in his mind.

'Photon Fury!'

When he filled the pulsating Spirit Zone with mass-bearing photons, an amazing phenomenon occurred.

As the Spirit Zone took on the hues of light, Rian and Tess could finally see with their own eyes how Shirone's mind was moving.

Kwakwakwakwakwakwakwakwak!

As the sphere of light repeated expansion and contraction, the ground gradually developed cracks. Eventually, it split like a giant rock with a crack, then shattered into thousands of pieces.
