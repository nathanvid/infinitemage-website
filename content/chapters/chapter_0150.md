Shirone's Rampage didn't stop there. Photons carrying physical force continued to pound thousands of stone fragments, pulverizing them until they became pebble-sized gravel.

"Graaaaaah!"

Shirone was gradually being buried deeper into the ground as the earth collapsed around the point of impact.

Compared to the test, the zone's diameter had shortened by four times, causing the speed to skyrocket dramatically. Even Shirone with his Diamond Body felt a sense of crisis.

It took twenty seconds from that point for the Rampage casting to finally stop. When Shirone explored with his Spirit Zone, he could no longer sense any magical power from the magic circle.

"Phew. Amy, do you think this is good enough?"

No one answered. All three people who had been watching Shirone were staring with identical expressions of bewilderment.

Amy burst into an incredulous laugh.

"Haha. Please use some common-sense magic, Shirone."

"What? I put a lot of thought into it. Anyway, the magic circle is destroyed, right?"

"Huh? Oh. Probably."

Amy entered her Spirit Zone to check the surroundings, but there really wasn't even a need to do so.

Even without synesthesia, just looking with her eyes showed that the area where the magic circle had been was completely devastated.

Amy approached where Shirone was standing. Only after examining the hemispherical depression in the terrain did she realize what characteristics Shirone's new magic possessed.

'It's photon amplification using mental oscillation. This must be magic he thought up during the practical period. But seriously, this destructive power is absolutely ridiculous.'

Although it had the disadvantage of a short range, that drawback didn't even register compared to the destructive force that could pulverize the ground into powder.

It was magic where the perfect combination of mental oscillation performed at the Diamond Body level, God Particles using Immortal Function, and the Flash magic Shining created an exquisite three-part harmony.

"But what on earth were you thinking when you came up with this?"

"Huh? No, actually I didn't know I'd use it in a situation like this. My specialty is omnidirectional defensive magic, right? So I was thinking I needed to learn a defensive magic. Then mental oscillation came to mind, so I tried incorporating God Particles into it."

"Ah, I see. So you're saying this is defensive magic?"

"Yeah, defensive magic."

Amy almost punched Shirone but held back. It was arguably the most destructive defensive magic she knew.

In short, it was magic that created rebound force by bouncing a light barrier containing mass at tremendous speed.

While its single-shot power might be less than Photon Cannon, if you fired at a rate of twenty times per second, nothing in the vicinity would survive.

Anyway, if you classified it strictly, it was indeed defensive magic.

While multi-shot attack magic is classified as scatter-shot, Rampage far exceeded those numbers to produce barrier-like effects, so there was a high probability the Association would register it as defensive magic.

"Shirone, are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?"

Tess ran over and asked worriedly. Rampage was the most tyrannical and brutal magic she had ever seen.

Since Shirone had been caught in the center of it, she thought it was a miracle he was standing unharmed.

"I'm fine. It's not as dangerous a magic as you might think."

"Not dangerous? I thought you were going to be destroyed too."

"Haha! I'm really okay. You can't call magic that hurts the mage defensive magic."

As Shirone said, Rampage was created to protect the mage, so its destructive power was merely an additional element.

While typical defensive magic generates durability through barrier thickness, Rampage uniquely creates rebound force through the momentum of traveling between minimum and maximum radii.

Therefore, if you set the minimum radius only to the mage's exterior, you'll never be caught up in Rampage no matter what, as if standing in the eye of a typhoon.

"Anyway, let's get serious. Now that I know the rhythm, I can cast faster. Thirty seconds should be no problem for breaking magic circles."

Amy, who had belatedly come to her senses, immediately revised their strategy.

"Right, with this magic we can keep breaking magic circles as we go. Let's avoid combat as much as possible and destroy the magic circles first. We'll provoke the enemy. And when they can't stand it anymore, we'll counterattack all at once. How's that?"

There could be no objections.

Shirone's group formed pairs of male and female to cast Teleportation. Two streaks of light flew freely through the forest, seeking magic circles to become their next prey.

* * *

"Rampage."

An explosion of light erupted around Shirone. As the photon barrier pounded the ground, the magic circle was destroyed without leaving a trace.

Shirone's group was already destroying their seventh magic circle.

During the fighting, they had also reduced the enemy's numbers by seven, but like veterans, the enemies weren't easily falling for Shirone's group's strategy.

Even as they ground their teeth each time an expensive magic circle was destroyed, they maintained their position of enduring the situation.

But when the number of destroyed magic circles exceeded fifteen, the enemies' position finally began to change.

They became anxious that if left alone, all the magic circles in the mountain would be completely destroyed.

"Damn it! How long are those bastards going to keep this up?"

"This is getting dangerous. About three magic circles are the limit for use at any specific point. At this rate, our operational radius will shrink rapidly."

"Squad leader! What do we do? It looks like they're determined to ruin all our assets."

The ten-man squad leader was equally frustrated.

The money the Freeman organization had poured into fortifying the northern forest amounted to half of their earnings over five years.

If they left things as they were, even if they achieved victory, it would be the same as defeat.

"Call everyone together. We'll trap and capture them."

A messenger rode the magic circles to relay the decision to squad leaders in each area. The other squad leaders seemed to be thinking the same thing, as responses came immediately.

Shirone's group could immediately sense that the battle's atmosphere was rapidly changing. Not only the enemies' movements but even their expressions were different from before.

The biggest change was that instead of the guerrilla tactics that had been harassing them, they were now primarily using combined tactics with dozens of people simultaneously forming encirclements.

However, that massive encirclement wasn't aimed at annihilating Shirone's group, but rather at luring them somewhere.

Despite having numerical superiority, they weren't foolish enough to engage in all-out battle against a party that included two mages.

Tess admired the enemies' tactical adaptation. This was definitely not the skill of people who had experienced such situations only once or twice.

"This is problematic in its own way. They're trapping us and leading us somewhere. There's definitely an ambush waiting to eliminate the mages."

Shirone didn't care. If the enemies were coming at them with full force, from now on it would be a race against time. They had to arrive as quickly as possible to rescue Yuna.

"It's fine. Let's defeat them there. For now, it's better to conserve our strength."

"But if it's a trap, isn't it dangerous?"

"I'll break through somehow. Leave it to me."

Shirone increased his running speed and surged to the front. While Schema could certainly reverse the situation, Tess didn't dare try to overtake him in the face of his determination.

"Whew. That's manly, Shirone."

To Tess, the current Shirone was definitely unfamiliar. She had only ever seen his gentle and kind side, so it was natural.

During this battle, Shirone had been the person she was most worried about. She had asked Rian if he could kill people, but in fact Shirone had also been included in that concern.

But once they entered actual combat, Shirone had completely transformed into a different person.

There was no trace of fear, and his response to enemies was so perfect that no flaws could be found.

This was a uniqueness belonging only to Shirone that no one else possessed.

While savagery and cruelty might be virtues in combat, the way Shirone fought seemed like watching a mechanical device that only repeatedly calculated efficiency.

Rian, who had guessed Tess's feelings, smiled secretly. It reminded him of his own emotions when he first met Shirone.

The real sword fight he'd had with Shirone in the training hall was chilling even now when he thought about it.

Shirone's insight even understood the terror of death. That image of him charging forward thinking only of swinging his sword had made even Rian break into a cold sweat.

"Tess, remember this. That's Shirone. Once he gets going, no one can stop him."

Unlike Rian, Amy was watching Shirone's behavior with some concern.

Of course, she too knew well how amazing Shirone's insight was. But it seemed like powerful variables named Yuna and Marsha were affecting what was driving him now.

"Even so, there'll be a trap, isn't this too reckless? He's charging straight ahead without time to analyze strategy."

"Time was delayed destroying magic circles. If Shirone's doing it, I won't stop him."

Rian cast his vote for Shirone and increased his speed.

But Tess agreed with Amy's opinion. Even while running, she analyzed the surroundings and spoke with a serious expression.

"Amy, the terrain is a bit strange. The men seem fired up, so let's balance things out."

"Yeah, that would be good. But what do you mean the terrain is strange?"

"If this isn't an artificially modified area, we'll soon be entering a valley. It's a perfect place to set traps. It could be dangerous."

Nature has its own laws. Humans change the forms of things to suit their preferences, but nature never goes against its natural order.

Judging from the mountain range they had passed through so far, the terrain was getting progressively lower.

Moreover, the increasing humidity and the prevalence of bryophytes rather than shrubs definitely meant they were entering a valley area.

'Yet there's no sound of water. These bastards have blocked the valley.'

Block the front and attack from both sides. It was close to orthodox tactics in warfare.

Tess was conflicted. Time was indeed pressing. But if they continued to be manipulated by the enemy like this, their side might be annihilated first.

"Amy, this won't do. Let's stop Shirone first."

Amy nodded without complaint. As Tess had predicted, the path was gradually narrowing and the cliffs were becoming too high to circumvent.

The biggest problem was that the number of enemies who had been building the encirclement was gradually decreasing.

"I'll tell him. Shirone! Wait a minute!"

Amy's voice didn't reach him. Before she could even speak, Shirone had cast Teleportation with Rian. Running alone seemed insufficient for him.

"Why is he acting like that?"

Amy, who had to pursue anyway, hugged Tess's waist and cast Teleportation.

But it was impossible for her to catch up to Shirone.

When limited to just the magic of Teleportation, Amy's skill was about on par with Shirone's, but not enough to overtake him.

Shirone, who was rushing forward rapidly, knew that Amy was following from behind.

But even so, he didn't stop his magic. As flash after flash continued in succession, Shirone and Rian instantly penetrated to the entrance of the valley.

Shirone, who stopped Teleportation there, ran along a stream where shallow water flowed.

Rian, who had followed along, asked with a puzzled expression.

"Shirone, why are you in such a hurry? Even I can see this place is a trap."

"That's why I came quickly. I have to destroy the trap somehow. Depending on the type of trap, I should be able to focus the enemies' attacks using Rampage."

"What? But what if you fail?"

"Then we'll be completely stuck. If we don't succeed here, the mission difficulty will increase several times over."

"That's not the problem. You could die. I'll do it instead."

"No, the reason I have to do it is because I can. If you keep this up, I'll have no choice but to leave you behind too."

Rian realized why Shirone had urgently created distance. If he said he would block the enemies' attacks alone, Tess or Amy would never allow it.

Shirone wanted to take risks and go with the option with higher odds of success. It seemed his thoughts about not having much time left to safely rescue Yuna were at work.
