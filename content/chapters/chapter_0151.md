"Rian, I'll be back. Explain to Tess and Amy."

"Huh? Hey, Shirone!"

Before Rian could stop him, Shirone cast Teleportation and disappeared at tremendous speed.

Shortly after, Amy and Tess caught up to Rian.

"Rian! Where did Shirone go?"

"He went ahead first. Just a moment ago."

"What the hell is he thinking? What did he say when he left?"

"I think he plans to trigger the traps beforehand with his Photon Cannon. He said he had to go alone because you wouldn't allow it."

"Of course I wouldn't! Who would approve of such a reckless method! Besides, Photon Cannon is a kinetic barrier, so it could be dangerous if the timing is off!"

"Right. That's exactly why he went alone - so he wouldn't have to hear that."

Amy was frustrated. Not because he acted unilaterally. It was because Shirone's chosen strategy was actually the most effective in terms of results.

But it was too dangerous. In normal circumstances, she might consider it even with low odds of success, but in this case, they had to consider the consequences of failure no matter how high the probability of success.

"If he fails, he'll die! That idiot!"

Amy shouted at Shirone who wasn't there, then placed her hands on Rian and Tess's waists.

"This won't do. Since stopping him is impossible, let's support him for now. Everyone stay alert. We're going to chase him at maximum speed."

Amy leaned forward and cast Teleportation. Intense light cut through the stream water and shot forward refreshingly.

* * *

The upstream end of the valley, the only passage to the hideout, was completely blocked by a 20-meter-high fortress wall.

Currently, about ten subordinates were positioned there, and Falcoa's men who had been building the encirclement were beginning to arrive one after another.

"The enemies are coming! Prepare to activate the traps!"

"They're much faster than expected! There's not enough time to activate everything."

The squad leader clicked his tongue. Whoever thought of this was quite clever. Since there was no way to bypass the traps, it was a strategy to rush the shortest distance and take action.

"It doesn't matter. These traps were designed to massacre hundreds from the start. Even half-activated, they'll be enough to bury four people."

The squad leader maintained his composure to the end and gave orders to his subordinates.

But when he saw a lone boy running toward them from 200 meters away, he couldn't help but feel bewildered.

"What? Why is he alone?"

"Seems like he rushed ahead in his impatience."

The squad leader didn't think so. While that possibility wasn't entirely out of the question, the moment he realized the enemy was alone, the feeling that took hold of his mind was unusual.

He began to think it would be a waste to trigger the traps.

"Excellent at psychological warfare. It would be a shame to use wide-area traps just to catch one person."

"Then what should we do? Should we go out and fight?"

"What do you mean, what should we do? Quickly activate the traps. Doesn't your brain work? That's exactly what that kid is thinking. I'll acknowledge he's gambling with his life, but he's underestimating us too much. If we catch even one of the two mages, the tide of battle will turn. This isn't the time to be stingy."

"Understood. Hey, we're starting now! Everyone prepare!"

Shirone glared up at the fortress wall blocking the valley. About ten enemies were drawing their bows and aiming at the sky.

'Arrow attack?'

Shirone was puzzled. It was nearly impossible to catch someone 100 meters away with just ten archers.

But the enemies shot their arrows without hesitation, and Shirone stopped running and looked up at the sky.

They looked no different from ordinary arrows. Only the colors of their arrowheads were different.

'Magic bullets!'

Shirone cast Teleportation and reflexively retreated. If he hadn't seen magic bullets directly at the Kergo Ruins, he would have been caught helplessly.

"Shirone!"

At that moment, hearing Amy's voice from behind, Shirone stopped retreating.

The fact that they had arrived much faster than expected allowed him to feel how anxious Amy was.

But Shirone didn't change his mind. In a situation where neither advance nor retreat was possible, the magic bullets crashed to the ground.

A powerful explosion occurred. The thunderous sound shook the valley as smoke spread thickly around Shirone.

Shirone realized their strategy. They planned to block his vision and then finish him with the traps.

"Amy! Don't come!"

Even without Shirone saying it, Amy couldn't bring herself to enter. From where the smoke hadn't spread, she could see with her eyes the massive vibrations operating above the valley.

As expected, fearsome mechanical devices similar to catapults revealed themselves in a row along the cliff. Though they had wheels, they were still large enough to require several people working together to move them.

"Now! Pour everything down!"

Following the squad leader's command, Falcoa's subordinates operated the devices. Massive boulders were hurled down into the valley using the power of levers.

The rocks were enormous enough to fill and overflow the V-shaped valley's cross-section.

Judging by their power, these weren't traps made to stop a few people. They were literally ultimate weapons designed to massacre enemies in a final battleground.

"Shirone!"

Amy cried out desperately, but it was already too late. The giant boulders were falling one by one into the smoke.

Amy heard the crushing sound her imagination created. But the next moment, a powerful sonic boom burst forth and swept away the hallucination.

The smoke that had been slowly filling the valley scattered in all directions, revealing Shirone surrounded by spheres of light.

'Photon Cannon!'

Light orbs flashed around Shirone. The Spirit Zone with a maximum diameter of 20 meters was larger than the boulders.

When such massive light ran wild at insane speeds, the observers were nearly blinded.

The light carrying mass desperately sought elastic rebound. But the rocks also fought back with considerable weight.

The boulders shaking roughly and breaking through the Photon Cannon seemed about to crush Shirone at any moment.

But when they came halfway down, the rocks shattered into dozens of pieces. And from there, Shirone's Photon Cannon began to overwhelm the rocks.

As the number of medium-sized rocks increased exponentially, a chain reaction of explosions occurred.

Smaller. Even smaller.

Shirone poured out photon machine-gun fire until the rocks turned to dust.

By the time what had been rocks reached near Shirone, only small grains remained. But even those were caught up in the light cycle and flew outward.

The time it took for the rocks to crash to the ground was only 2 seconds, and that matched exactly the time it took for them to decompose into dust.

The thousands of events that occurred in between were compressed into human cognition, creating an optical illusion as if a massive explosion had taken place.

The dust scattered in all directions settled to the ground with a rustling commotion.

An ominous wind sound circled the valley.

Falcoa's subordinates couldn't understand what had just happened. There was a flash of light, and then the rocks burst like dust. That was all they could see with their eyes.

Shirone stepped through the dust-covered stream, glaring up at the fortress wall. He could see the subordinates who had operated the traps returning one after another.

The squad leader realized something had gone wrong. He had lived on battlefields for over ten years, but he had never even heard rumors of such magic existing.

"Damn it! What the hell is that brat!"

"Squad leader! What should we do?"

"Prepare magic bullets! Fire away!"

As the subordinates quickly separated the arrowheads and attached magic bullets, Shirone, who had been glaring fiercely at them, concentrated his mental power in front of his eyes.

A photon sphere burst into existence and vibrated powerfully while absorbing the surrounding light.

"Squad leader! Look over there! That's dangerous!"

Someone who had experienced Shirone's technique at the tavern royal palace shouted to the squad leader.

Indeed, even from the squad leader's perspective, the light larger than a human face compressing looked ominous.

"Damn! Hurry! Fire the magic bullets quickly!"

The subordinates' movements became even faster, but the magic was first.

Between Shirone and the fortress wall, a line was drawn as if a straight flash had suddenly been born.

KWAAAAANG!

The Photon Cannon struck the iron gate head-on, and an earsplitting metallic screech tormented their ears.

The subordinates assembling magic bullets frowned and bent over. The impact was so powerful that vibrations could be felt even on top of the fortress wall. Even after the magic disappeared, the iron gate continued making groaning sounds.

"What, what? Is it broken? Check it!"

A subordinate went down the stairs connected to the ground and examined the castle gate. The thick iron plate was bent overall, but it wasn't destroyed.

Whether he felt even this result was a victory report, the subordinate shouted with bright spirits.

"The castle gate is safe!"

"Good! Now it's our turn to attack."

When the Photon Cannon's attack came to nothing, Tess looked around at his friends and said.

"We can't break the castle gate with magic. Rian, let's climb up the fortress wall."

To achieve victory in siege warfare, one of two things must be successful.

The first is to destroy the castle gate using siege weapons or magic, then push forces through.

But if the castle gate cannot be destroyed, climbing the fortress wall and eliminating the enemies could also be a method. And that was a mission that swordsmen like Tess and Rian had to undertake.

"Right. It would be better for us to climb up."

Rian inserted his straight sword behind his back so he could run comfortably. But just as the two were about to lean forward and start, Amy stopped them.

"Wait, hold on."

"There's no time to delay. We have to strike before the enemies regroup. Now is our chance."

Tess's judgment was correct. Amy, being fire-based, was weak against impact force, and Shirone's Photon Cannon was also useless against thick iron gates.

But Amy knew that Shirone had one more weapon.

Moreover, it was magic that showed the best efficiency in situations like this.

"It's okay. Shirone will handle it."

Tess, who didn't understand the situation, looked at Shirone with a bewildered expression, then suddenly opened his eyes wide.

Red light was emanating from Shirone's body.

"What, what? Isn't that dangerous?"

Humans become anxious when they see the color red. This is because it reminds them of bleeding.

Even Tess found the eerie red light frightening to look at, so the enemies' wariness was beyond imagination.

"Squad leader, what the hell is that?"

Shirone shot a red flash forward. A single laser reached the iron gate at a speed that could be called instantaneous and heated the surface.

"Ugh! What is it?"

The subordinates who had already tasted the power of Photon Cannon were frightened and backed away.

But there was no expected shockwave or thunderous sound.

The squad leader who examined the castle gate from below the fortress wall regained his confidence. The current magic was merely illuminating the iron gate and showed no power whatsoever.

"Good! Now! Prepare magic bullets!"

Including the subordinates who had returned from the traps, there were over 40 people. With this number, they could devastate the area around Shirone with magic bullet bombardment.

When all the subordinates finished aiming, the squad leader lowered his hand and shouted.

"Fire...! Huh?"

Kukukukukukukukuku!

At that moment, the fortress wall began shaking roughly.

Not only the squad leader but also the subordinates who were about to release their bowstrings looked at each other with surprised expressions.

A subordinate who bent over the fortress wall to examine the iron gate spoke in a trembling voice.

"Sq-squad leader! That...!"

The iron gate shook frantically. Eventually, the vibration that started from the iron gate spread throughout the entire fortress wall, shaking the foundation of the structure.

Faced with a sight they had never seen before, Falcoa's subordinates could only be horrified.

The iron where the laser touched began to boil, then started bulging out like air bubbles.

Then the fortress wall shook as if it would be uprooted entirely, and finally, with an explosion, the iron gate burst outward.
