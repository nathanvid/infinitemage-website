The leader's eyes nearly popped out of their sockets. The iron gate that could withstand most siege weapons had been pierced through.

"Damn it! Fire straight at him!"

A makeshift order was given. Since the castle gate had already been breached, if they couldn't stop him here, the tide of battle would rapidly shift in their favor.

Understanding this fact, his subordinates also aimed directly at Shirone and drew their bowstrings.

"Fire!"

Forty magic bullets shot with all their might flew toward Shirone's vicinity.

Even seeing the arrows rushing toward him at high speed, Shirone didn't move. The radius of Teleportation alone wouldn't be enough to escape the explosion's range.

But spatial teleportation was a different story.

The moment the forty arrows crashed down, Shirone's body transformed into a flash of light and shot up into the sky.

Kiiiiiiing!

As soon as the noise of spatial teleportation spread, a powerful bombardment devastated the spot where Shirone had been.

Tess stared at the bombardment in bewilderment. Hearing the thunder echoing through the valley, she felt as if she were standing at the center of a battlefield.

"Sh-Shirone..."

The scale of the explosion was tremendous, and the blast was enough to shake one's mind. Therefore, no one knew that Shirone had cast spatial teleportation.

Only Amy was an exception. They say archers hear the sound of flying arrows most clearly, and swordsmen hear the clash of swords most distinctly.

Therefore, as a mage, Amy could clearly hear the distinctive sound of spatial teleportation even amid the roar of the explosion.

"Shirone is safe. Let's go in too."

Amy moved forward, cutting through the gunpowder smoke. As expected, when they passed the bombardment point, they could see Shirone standing in front of the castle gate.

Spatial teleportation bends light. Therefore, seeing the flash shoot up into the sky was merely an optical illusion.

In reality, it wasn't Shirone shooting up into the sky, but rather the phenomenon of space bending.

Moreover, such illusions could only be observed from a distance; if viewed from close range, it would normally feel as if he had just suddenly disappeared.

This was precisely why mages distinguished whether spatial teleportation had been cast by its sound.

"Bwahahaha! It's over! Completely over!"

"There's not even a trace left! There's nothing to fear now. Boys, prepare for full assault!"

Falcoa's subordinates put down their bows and picked up weapons. Since the most threatening mage who had displayed such power was dead, there was nothing left to fear.

Watching this, Tess tilted her head. Clearly Shirone was standing in front of the iron gate like a grim reaper, yet the enemies were cheering instead.

"What's wrong with them? Why are they acting like that?"

"Like you, they couldn't hear the sound of spatial teleportation. They think Shirone died."

It didn't take long for Falcoa's subordinates to correct their mistake.

When Shirone slowly stepped back and revealed himself outside the blind spot of the castle walls, everyone was startled as if they had seen a ghost.

"B-Boss! Over there...!"

The leader's face flushed red. Shirone, who should have had his limbs torn off by the bombardment, was looking up at the castle walls as if to show off.

"You, you bastard!"

Before engaging in a full-scale siege, Shirone decided to give the enemies one last chance.

"Release Gis's sister. Then we'll turn back from here."

The leader stared at Shirone in bewilderment. After causing all this chaos, he wanted to go back? Go back where? Did he think this was some amusement park where you pay an entrance fee?

"Do you think we'll let you live and send you back? The real nature of siege warfare begins when the castle gate is breached. Do you know how much the magic circle you destroyed costs? It's money that can't be repaid even with your life. I'll torment you until you beg to die."

"I don't want to fight a meaningless battle anymore. You were wrong from the beginning. So I'd like you to end it here."

"Bwahahaha! What? End it? Do you know who we are? We're the Parrot Bandits who live on the battlefield and die on the battlefield! Boys, let's go! Slaughter them thoroughly!"

"Uaaaaah!"

The soldiers shouted spiritedly, raising their swords.

When words didn't get through, Shirone sighed and walked to the blind spot of the castle walls.

"How convenient that he's coming in by himself! Boys, go down right now and... huh?"

At that moment, the leader stopped speaking. A single scene flashed through his mind.

It was that strange magic that had pulverized the falling rock from above the valley into powder. Could he really be confident that this castle wall was harder than rock?

"H-hey, wait a minute...!"

The leader ran to the stairs and looked at the castle gate. As expected, Shirone had crawled through the hole in the iron gate and was bringing his fist down.

"Hey, hey, man, you're joking, right? Surely you're not..."

The leader's voice trembled with fear. His mind went completely blank.

"Hey! Don't do it! Do you know how much trouble we went through to build this castle wall? Hey!"

Shirone finished preheating his magic and glanced back at the leader standing on the landing.

The leader who met those eyes finally realized that the decision had already been made.

"Take cover! Everyone jump down!"

As the leader shouted while climbing the stairs, Shirone muttered quietly.

"Photon Cannon."

Kwakwakwakwakwakwakwakwakwakwang!

A Photon Cannon with a 20-meter diameter pulsed at a rate of 15 times per second. As the castle walls shook as if an earthquake had occurred, Falcoa's subordinates lost their balance and fell.

As expected of a massive structure, its durability was considerable. But Shirone didn't stop the Photon Cannon. After all, there are limits to material durability. If you keep hammering until it breaks, it will eventually break - that's the law of physics.

The iron gate made a clanging racket as if being hammered, and cracks raced across the castle walls like lightning.

The cracks continuously branched out and penetrated the entire castle wall, and finally the ground began to shake as signs of collapse began to occur.

The leader was in a panic.

He was a veteran who had experienced quite a few sieges, but while castle gates had been destroyed before, this was his first time seeing such a crude tactic of bringing down the castle itself.

"Aaaaah! I get it! We lost! Stop it!"

The leader screamed, but because photons carrying mass were using the castle as percussion instruments, his voice couldn't carry even a meter.

'Damn! This can't happen!'

This was truly dangerous.

If the castle collapsed like this, what would happen to the 40 lives would be a matter left to God.

"Uuuuh!"

Shirone wrinkled his brow as he concentrated on the Photon Cannon. With a uniform rhythm without acceleration or deceleration, he was knocking everything around him outward.

From a position where the entire castle wall was visible, Tess watched the scene in a daze.

First, the center of the castle wall was partially destroyed, then hysterical cracks spread along the walls. The left side seemed to sag slightly, then this time the right side sank down as if to balance it.

And finally...

Kurururururung!

The entire castle collapsed.

"My goodness... That's just a human weapon, isn't it?"

Rian agreed with Tess's assessment. Until now, Shirone had tended to use magic to protect someone.

When such a person truly decided he needed to destroy something, they could newly realize how different the results could be, even with the same magic.

"Certainly impressive. It seems I didn't properly know Shirone either."

Amy smiled and agreed with that statement. While combat wasn't everything for a mage, it was certainly a matter of pride.

"Shirone doesn't usually escalate things. But when he sets his mind to it, his combat ability itself is also incredibly excellent. With this level, he could easily rank in the upper tier even among the graduating class."

Tess burst into laughter. She seemed to understand what Amy was saying.

'She was paying attention without realizing it after all. Her outside and inside really are different.'

Amy was genuinely happy about Shirone's growth. At this rate, perhaps graduating together with Shirone might not be just a dream.

'You've followed along, Shirone.'

When the Photon Cannon ended, the castle wall had completely collapsed. The castle wall built on the valley side barely maintained its form, but the center had completely caved in as if giant rocks had rolled through.

"Uuugh..."

Soldiers buried under stones groaned and squirmed.

Not a single person looked uninjured. Even the leader who had tried to stop Shirone couldn't avoid the castle wall's collapse and was in a state with a broken arm.

But he was too bewildered to even feel pain.

Five years of hardships building the northern hideout flashed before his eyes like a panorama.

"This can't be. Annihilation by just one person? The Parrot Bandits?"

At the sound of Shirone's approaching footsteps, the leader flinched and turned his head. Meeting Shirone's intense gaze, uncontrollable fear surged up.

"Bring Gis's sister right now! If you don't, I won't let this slide!"

"Hiik!"

The leader instinctively covered his face. Then his broken arm fell like a pendulum and swayed before his eyes.

"Uuugh...!"

The leader who discovered his own bizarrely bent arm rolled back his eyes and fainted on the spot.

Shirone's party.

First checkpoint passed.

* * *

"Wow. Impressive, Shirone."

Marsha was watching Shirone's battle from 200 meters away from the castle wall.

Sitting with a handkerchief spread on the ground, she looked as leisurely as a girl who had come out for a picnic.

What happened to her subordinates was sad. But wasn't living with that sadness also part of being a mercenary? She was the one who had lost hundreds of people after being deceived by politicians' schemes.

"He was so strong yet deceived people so perfectly. No, was he so relaxed because he was strong?"

She knew he was a child with talent for magic, but she hadn't expected him to show this level of performance.

What was most impressive was that all of Shirone's magic was being applied from his own independent omniscience.

'An Unlocker...'

Marsha was in a good mood.

She was pleased that Shirone was a strong person, and she also liked that he was the kind of hypocritical human who tried to embrace others' pain.

Most exciting of all was the fact that soon, such a pure and beautiful boy would be crushed to pieces in her hands.

"You'd need 10 more years to catch me, kid."

Marsha stretched and stood up. Her bracelet glowed intensely, then instantly transported her body to the northern cliff.

**Second Encounter (1)**

Shirone's party continued northward. Since most of Falcoa's subordinates were injured at the first checkpoint, no battles occurred.

"This way."

Finding the path in the forest was Amy's responsibility.

In a natural maze, if you run without paying attention, you're bound to lose your sense of direction.

But such common sense didn't apply to Amy. Tess, following behind Amy, realized that Amy indeed had the talent to excel in reconnaissance operations.

'Indeed. Insight can be used this way too.'

Amy's self-image memory perfectly restored the state at specific points in time. Therefore, as long as she didn't lose consciousness, she could accurately determine direction no matter where she was moved.

"Amy, there's a mountain path over there."

As soon as Amy heard Shirone's words, she changed direction and left the forest.

A winding mountain path was flowing toward the summit of the highland.

Tess checked the condition of the ground. Though some time seemed to have passed, there were traces of a carriage having passed through.

"From here begins their living territory. In siege warfare terms, would this be entering the inner castle?"

It was welcome news for those who were tired from running through the forest.

However, it wasn't yet a situation where they could let their guard down. They had defeated most of the forces, but those called officers hadn't shown even a glimpse of themselves.

"If we just follow this path, we'll reach the hideout. Let's push on a little more."

Amy spoke decisively, but actually couldn't be certain. It was just something she said out of a sense of duty as a leader to boost her friends' morale.

Based on the combat movements recorded in her current self-image memory and the total curved travel distance, they had moved approximately 12 kilometers from where the battle started. Converting to a straight line, they had advanced more than 7 kilometers on the map.
