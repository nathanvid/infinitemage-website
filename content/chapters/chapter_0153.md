"We're definitely close. Just about one more kilometer ahead..."

Just as Amy was about to explain, a fireball burst out of the forest with a fierce roar.

"Ambush! Take cover!"

Shirone's group scattered in different directions. The flames that crashed into the ground devoured the air, growing in size before dissipating as heat.

"Fireball?"

"Amy! Watch out!"

Second and third attacks came flying simultaneously.

But Amy didn't dodge. Instead, she took a combat stance and glared at the flames, then pierced through the fireballs with an equal number of Flame Strikes.

"Come out! Stop hiding like a coward and ambushing us!"

"Quite skilled. Your arrival here wasn't mere luck after all."

Shirone's group looked back at the mountain path. A single man emerged from the forest. He was about the same height as Rian but had a lean, agile build.

Despite having no eyebrows, his slicked-back hair exuded confidence, and his pale complexion made him resemble a snake.

"Who are you?"

"Vice-captain of the Parrot Bandits. Agado Freeman."

The mention of vice-captain brought tension to Shirone's group's faces. But conversely, it also meant their destination wasn't far.

"Shirone, I'll handle this. When I give the signal, take Rian and Tess to the cliff."

"I can't let you do that. It's too dangerous."

"What about you then? Did you forget you jumped into a trap alone? Are you going to keep ignoring me like this?"

"I'm not ignoring you. That man isn't alone. There are about twenty people hiding in the forest."

Amy had already confirmed this with her Spirit Zone. But that was precisely why she wanted to send Shirone ahead first.

If they got tied up here, they'd only be buying time for reinforcements to arrive from the first checkpoint.

Amy raised her hand and pointed at Freeman as she tried to convince Shirone somehow.

"Shirone, look at that man's weapon. It's a gun."

Shirone also turned his head to examine it carefully. It was definitely a weapon that looked exactly like what he'd seen in books.

While magic bullets shot from bows required replacing arrowheads, guns were specially manufactured weapons designed to use only magic bullets.

It was a device that loaded a small amount of magic bullets and fired them forward. Based on the design, it appeared to be a revolver system capable of rapid fire through cylinder rotation.

"Do you understand? You know what a gun is, right? It can replace bullets faster than arrows, and it's a direct-fire weapon. Unlike arrows that explode after impact, these are fired already manifested, so they're specialized for medium to long-range combat. The guys hiding in the forest are probably all using that weapon too."

Shirone understood Amy's meaning.

"Got it. Then I'll leave this to you."

Rian and Tess looked back with puzzled expressions. They'd heard the explanation about guns, but if anything, it only made the situation seem more dangerous. So why was Shirone changing his mind to leave Amy alone?

"I'll buy time with Fire Wall so they can't pursue. Break through in that gap."

"Understood. Rian, Tess, get ready."

If it was Shirone's judgment, Rian would simply follow. Though he didn't feel good about leaving a comrade behind, this wasn't a situation for lengthy debates, so Tess also gulped and prepared to dash out.

"Now! Go!"

Amy, having finished her mental concentration, shouted with blazing eyes. As Shirone set the direction and ran, Rian and Tess followed on either side.

As expected, flames from guns flew from all directions in the forest.

Amy cast Fire Wall in the form of a massive circle.

The ground began to boil like porridge, then flames that started from beneath her feet charged forward with terrifying force, penetrating into the forest.

She then amplified her mental power, causing the wall of fire to blaze violently and block the enemies' vision.

Simultaneously, Shirone grabbed Rian and Tess and deployed spatial teleportation. Though the range was shorter than that of advanced mages, it was sufficient for disappearing right before the enemies' eyes.

Hearing the sound of spatial teleportation, Amy finally stopped casting Fire Wall and panted heavily.

Fire Wall, called a magic-devouring parasite, required continuously pouring mental power to maintain the barrier.

The reason it wasn't classified as overpowered despite its tremendous force was because the casting cost was too expensive.

But Freeman was genuinely impressed. The girl standing before him was merely a teenager.

As far as he knew, mages who could cast Fire Wall of this scale at that age were extremely rare.

"Admirable. Sacrificing yourself for your comrades."

"Hmph! Don't talk about sacrifice. I sent them away because I'm strong enough alone."

"Is that so? You seem quite tired though. Sorry, but we're in a hurry too, so I can't wait."

As Freeman's words ended, his subordinates appeared.

The fact that none of them could extinguish the fire burning in the forest was proof that there were no mages among them. But they were all Schema users and carried guns like Freeman.

A combat method combining Schema and magic. On battlefields, such people are called gunners.

Though Amy had never witnessed gunner combat, she could predict it. She herself could simultaneously use long-range magical abilities and Schema.

Freeman's subordinates opened their cylinders and loaded magic bullets. The cylinders seemed to hold at least six magic bullets each.

They could equip twelve spells total on both sides, and there were twenty enemies. Therefore, the enemy firepower cycle between reloads was two hundred forty magic bullets.

"Sorry, but your reckless adventure ends here."

As Freeman finished speaking, his subordinates raised their guns.

Indeed, subordinates reflected their leader's characterâ€”these were different from those under Falcoa's command.

They showed no carelessness or bravado, focusing solely on eliminating their target.

Amy burst into laughter. Though Shirone had been the main fighter in this battle, she hadn't expected such a harsh evaluation of herself.

"Just twenty people think they can have a gunfight with me?"

Amy drew strength into her lower abdomen, pulling her legs together as she cast magic.

A whirlwind swept through, and fist-sized stones rose around her, catching fire with crackling sounds.

"This time, you picked the wrong opponent."

Amy's eyes blazed with red light.

* * *

Even while running, Tess kept looking back. Though she'd followed believing in Shirone's words, no matter how she thought about it, this was a reckless strategy.

Even if gunners were inferior to mages in firepower, they possessed physical abilities comparable to swordsmen.

Thinking of Amy fighting in the midst of such people made her stomach burn with worry.

"Shirone, shouldn't we go back even now? I'm worried about Amy."

"She'll be fine. Delaying would be disadvantageous. The surviving forces from the first checkpoint might pursue us. Getting to the hideout quickly should be our priority."

"I understand that, but what about Amy? Wouldn't it have been better for you to eliminate the enemies instead?"

Seeing through Tess's thoughts, Shirone smiled bitterly.

"That's not right. A mage's skill isn't simply evaluated by power alone. It varies by situation and by specialty. Against gunners, Amy would be several times stronger than me."

Tess looked unconvinced.

Of course, she knew Amy was in the graduating class, but Shirone's prowess since arriving here had been truly tremendous.

Could there really exist a situation where someone could be several times stronger than such a Shirone?

"Is that possible? No matter how skilled, there's such a thing as numerical advantage."

Like a swordsman, Tess thought centered on physical force.

Certainly, the total sum of physical force calculated by numbers was an important factor in combat.

But when it came to magic, the situation was somewhat different.

For mages who used countless phenomena through the combination of omniscience and omnipotence, enemy numbers weren't that important.

Rather, what they focused on was excellent calculation ability to guide situations so their honed abilities could display optimal efficiency.

"The characteristics of photons and flames are different. Plus, the strengths of the Four-Direction Style are different too. Amy is a mage specialized in long-range combat. That's because it can maximize the advantages of Insight. No matter how strong the enemies are, if Amy faces them in her domain..."

Shirone spoke with conviction.

"No matter how many there are, they can never beat Amy."

Tess gulped. Usually when dealing with Shirone and Amy, she felt like caring for stubborn, immature younger siblings, but in actual combat, they became cold as ice.

"You guys are really amazing. How can you be so decisive?"

"That's a misunderstanding on your part, Tess. I think you're the amazing one."

"Tch. What about me. Actually, you broke the castle, and I didn't help at all."

Shirone didn't think so. After all, the proficiency levels of swordsmen and mages were bound to be different from the start.

While many in mental disciplines showed achievements beyond their age, swordsmen who needed physical growth as backing tended to distinguish themselves relatively later.

Tess and Rian would gradually become stronger. And they would walk their own paths with conviction in a single sword.

"Shirone, we've arrived."

Leaving the forest, a landscape of blue sea undulating beyond a natural cliff was revealed.

A brick house was visible to the east of the cliff. That seemed to be the hideout. But to get there, they had to pass through one final checkpoint.

Action captain Falcoa was waiting for Shirone's group.

Tess frowned in puzzlement. Based on her assessment of his personality, he should have long since grabbed his sword and rushed into battle.

"What? That bastard was still here?"

"Heh heh heh, smashing you at the start would be much more fun. But I have my circumstances too."

There had been Marsha's orders. Though it wasn't a strategy that suited his temperament, Falcoa obediently followed. It was the word of the person who had made him, once dismissed as society's evil, into a battlefield hero.

"Anyway, you made it this far. The boss was right. The woman you're looking for is in that building over there. Go in and bring her out if you can."

Falcoa pretended to clear the way by turning his body aside. But Shirone's group couldn't move. A killing intent of completely different nature from what they'd seen in the royal palace was blocking their path.

Tess understood Amy's feelings. Ultimately, to fight such a master, they had no choice but to take some risks.

"He's trying to disturb us. Rian and I will handle this. Shirone, you go in and bring Yuna."

Shirone nodded readily. At his natural reaction, Tess realized why Amy had smiled. Far from feeling left out, she felt warmth in her heart.

'It's not such a cold world after all. Is this what it feels like to be trusted?'

With Shirone's skills, escaping alone would be no problem at all. After watching for a moment, he cast spatial teleportation and his body disappeared in a flash.

But Falcoa didn't even turn his gaze.

From that behavior, Tess realized. He had intended to let Shirone go from the beginning.

"Why?"

"Well, the boss's orders aside, I much prefer the side with women."

Falcoa drew his sword and pointed it at Tess. He was clearly a man of crude character. But the staggering appearance of being intoxicated had vanished.

Without taking her eyes off Falcoa, Tess explained the strategy to Rian.

"He's a Schema user. I'll block him while you attack."

She could gauge how skilled Falcoa was just from his stance. Therefore, having Tess, who was also a Schema user, defend was the method to increase survival chances.

"That won't work. I'll block, so you attack."

"You fool, how can you block? I hate to say this, but stopping that guy alone is beyond you."

"If it's beyond me, then I'll have no choice but to die."

"What?"

Tess looked up in bewilderment. But Rian was serious. Nor had he given up fighting. He was simply fighting his own battle.

"We're staying here to beat that guy. We're not fighting to preserve our lives."

Tess couldn't argue.

"If you block, we can buy time. But you know, right? That way we can't win. In the end, we'll both die. Therefore, I'll block somehow. In the meantime, you focus on attacking."

Rian was right. Dulling the sword and strengthening the shield couldn't win a battle.

Ultimately, even if it meant risking one's life, sharpening the sword was the correct principle.
