"Can you hold out? His Schema won't be at a student's level."

"Even so, I have to try, don't I? There's no choice but to give it a shot."

Rian dragged Augent's signature greatsword along the ground as he slowly advanced forward. Meanwhile, Tess moved sideways as if trying to escape Falcoa's line of sight.

It was a textbook formation for a two-person pass, but Falcoa paid it no mind.

If he, who had been called the Demon of the Battlefield, was to be swayed by mere younglings like these, how much would those who had lost their lives to his blade mock him?

Rian straightforwardly thrust his greatsword forward and said, "Come at me. I'll take you on."

But before he could even finish speaking, Falcoa had already closed the distance. It was an acceleration beyond imagination.

"Kahahahahaha!"

Rian, who blocked the sword descending vertically, felt his nose tingle. It wasn't the clash of blade against blade, but rather the impact of a hammer striking down.

"What? Giving up already?"

Falcoa frantically hammered away at the greatsword. With each impact, Rian's knees bent. Eventually, unable to endure any longer, he dropped to one knee on the ground.

"Kuuk!"

The muscles in the arm gripping the straight sword went into spasms. At that moment, Falcoa's kick struck his solar plexus.

Rian's body rolled away across the ground like a ball.

"Rian!"

Tess let out a cry of anguish. The situation already seemed over. But defying Falcoa's expectations, Rian sprang back to his feet.

His abnormal strength aside, stamina was also one of Rian's specialties.

"Phew, I get it now. So this is your level?"

Falcoa's eyebrows twitched. But Rian didn't stop there, pointing his greatsword straight at his opponent and provoking him.

"Good. Now it begins. Come at me as much as you want."

"Kukukuku, I'll kill you."

Falcoa's mouth split from ear to ear.

It was exactly how he looked when he was called the Demon of the Battlefield.

Shirone opened the building's door and went inside. Despite being a place used by mercenaries, a tidy living room was revealed, with potted plants lined up beneath a window where sunlight poured down.

"Where is Gis's little sister?"

Shirone went around room by room. When he opened the third door, he froze while gripping the door handle.

A pleasant fragrance wafted from the room. A red carpet was laid out, and on top of it, a bed and desks were arranged according to specifications.

Shirone looked at the woman sitting on the bed. When he had heard Tess's words, he had been vaguely prepared, but actually facing her in person was an enormous shock.

"Oh my, you came, Shirone. Have you been well?"

"Sister Marsha..."

Marsha was definitely the leader of the organization that had kidnapped Yuna. But she was smiling with such an affectionate face that such thoughts couldn't cross his mind.

"Did you get home safely that day? Did you make up with your friend?"

Shirone swallowed the answer that had risen to his throat. It seemed Marsha knew he was coming. But even so, she hadn't handed over Yuna.

"You already know, don't you? You must have heard everything."

"Oh my, why are you being so scary, Shirone? Are you angry with your sister? I'm sorry about deceiving you back then."

As Marsha approached while acting coquettish, Shirone backed away, maintaining the same distance.

"Phew, you really are angry. What should I do for you to forgive your sister? Should I kneel down and beg here? If that's what you want, I'll do it."

"Please return Gis's little sister. That's all I want."

"Aha! So that's what it was? Oh my, you should have said so earlier. I misunderstood and thought you came to fight me. Well, there's no way kind Shirone would do such a thing. What a relief."

Shirone was confused. Who exactly was this person? He couldn't understand her behavior, as if she was experiencing a different situation in a different world.

"Where is Yuna?"

"She's on the second floor. If you want to take her, you can take her."

Shirone turned around. He didn't want to think about Marsha anymore. He just wanted to leave this place as quickly as possible.

"Oh, right. But shouldn't you bring some clothes to cover her with?"

Shirone's steps stopped abruptly. When he turned back around, Marsha was smiling with eyes full of mischief.

"It would be a bit much to see a stranger's naked body, wouldn't it? That's why I'm telling you in advance. Don't be too shocked. Her mind might have become strange. My subordinates were quite rough with her."

The colder Shirone's gaze became, the faster Marsha spoke.

"I was watching from the side, and the screaming was no joke. Well, I wouldn't have been able to endure that either. Looking back now, I think it might have been too harsh. But Shirone, you know what? It was all something I ordered. Still, I think you'll understand. Because you're kind Shirone. Right?"

Shirone kept his mouth firmly shut. That fact brought tremendous happiness to Marsha.

"How is it, Shirone? How do you feel?"

"What feeling? What exactly do you want to hear?"

Shirone no longer felt Marsha was worth respecting. But that was truly an exhilarating event for Marsha.

"Hohoho! You really are angry? Why are you mad at me? You said so yourself - that my kleptomania would get better someday. But now your thoughts have changed, haven't they? What if you had scolded me harshly back then? Then I might not have kidnapped Yuna. Honestly, you were really unlucky."

Shirone turned completely toward her. Now Yuna wasn't the problem. Marsha had committed something that should never have been done.

"Hm? Answer me, will you? How do you feel? Are you going crazy? Are you miserable because the sister you loved so much suddenly became like this? Are you thinking that there's nothing left in the world to believe in?"

"Do you need to hear other people's emotions... spoken out loud to feel reassured?"

At Shirone's question, Marsha's laughter stopped.

"If you really wanted that, you could just do it. But why do you care about my feelings? Are you afraid I might be disappointed?"

"Stop talking nonsense! I'm mocking you!"

"Really? Then shall I tell you what I think of you right now?"

Marsha's face hardened. Like someone whose right to choose words had been taken away, she just waited for Shirone's answer.

"I don't hate you. In my memories, you're still a good person."

Marsha's expression changed in real time. Her flustered face gradually turned to disappointment, and finally to anger.

"Stop spouting nonsense. If that's really true, can you forgive me? Can you smile at me like before, after I trampled on Gis's little sister?"

"No. You've committed something that should never have been done. If you really did such a thing, I would never forgive you."

"Haha! Don't tell me you think I'm lying? But what can you do? What I said is true. Go upstairs and check."

"Even if it's true, I don't hate you. It's just..."

Shirone looked at her and bit his lips.

"I'm just sad that you, who would know that suffering better than anyone, did such a thing."

Sparks flew in Marsha's eyes. Her expression twisted viciously and her clenched teeth ground together.

If she had really trampled Yuna, it wouldn't have been so unbearable. She couldn't stand it. Shirone, who babbled as if he knew everything about her, annoyed her.

"You! You're really getting on my nerves!"

Shirone hastily backed away. Marsha's zone penetrating through synesthesia was sharp enough to feel stinging.

A star-shaped zone.

It was the unique sensation of the attack form among the Four-Direction Style.

Shirone, preparing for Marsha's attack, met it with defensive form. But he was concerned about Yuna on the second floor.

Urban areas were quite a troublesome environment for mages. It wasn't simply a matter of reducing the Spirit Zone's radius.

To express it in a swordsman's terms, it was like discarding the main weapon longsword and fighting with a dagger instead.

'I wonder what type of mage she is...'

While observing Marsha, Shirone cast photon magic in advance so he could immediately evade any attack that came.

But Marsha's magic exceeded Shirone's expectations. When she raised her eyes and let out a sharp scream, a tremendous roar penetrated his eardrums.

"Kuuk!"

Shirone, who received a mental shock, staggered. A sharp pain was transmitted as if a needle had pierced through one ear and exited through the other.

'Sonic cannon. She was a sound mage. This is dangerous.'

Sound-type mages are those who study sound. They create various sound waves by vibrating the air, not necessarily using human voices, and the representative attack magic was the sonic cannon that Marsha had cast.

The sound pressure of a sonic cannon exceeds 150 decibels. If hit at close range, it had enough power to tear eardrums and cause deafness.

Because it's directional magic that amplifies sound waves, it doesn't spread over a wide radius like a laser, but it's one of the difficult magics to counter because it's invisible.

'This is disadvantageous here.'

Just as Shirone and Amy's efficiency was extremely divided depending on situation and environment, combat in an enclosed space was like home turf for Marsha, who dealt with sound.

Shirone racked his brains to overcome the current situation. The method he finally chose was ultra-high-speed Teleportation in a narrow space.

Mixing Patrol and Rainbow Drop as he moved around the room, complex flash patterns confused Marsha.

As soon as Shirone seized her rear, he cast Photon Cannon. But Marsha easily dodged the magic rushing from her blind spot by twisting her body.

'How?'

Unless she had eyes in the back of her head, there was no way to detect an attack from a blind spot.

No, even if she had eyes back there, avoiding Photon Cannon at this distance would be impossible.

"Fufu, you look surprised? That can't be all you've got, right?"

"Could it be... sonar?"

"Oh my, as expected of a magic school graduate. You study hard, don't you?"

Sonar is the ability to read sounds. Originally maximized only underwater, mages could make their zones into any medium through omnipotence.

The detection ability of a sonar master was known to surpass that of a zoner in terms of density.

Therefore, it was natural that she could react simultaneously with Shirone casting Photon Cannon.

"Amplification magic is annoying. It's so unsightly."

Shirone tilted his head. It might be something he could just let pass, but thinking about it, it was a strange thing to say. There were no mages who disparaged the magic they had learned.

"But I like this one."

If she had mastered sonar, there was no need to amplify sound. When Marsha spread both arms, the air in front vibrated and sonic cannons flew from both sides.

Shirone hastily cast Teleportation. But sound was faster than his reflexes.

When the high-decibel sound waves turned his mind upside down, the magic was dispelled. Sound-based magic was truly dangerous for mages who needed to concentrate their minds.

Marsha encompassed the entire building with Sidelooking magic.

Like a dolphin, it was magic that fired sound waves and read the echoes, a powerful detection magic that could accurately measure existence, direction, and distance regardless of cover.

Shirone was cornered. Sonic cannons were impossible to defend against. Moreover, with Sidelooking's immediate detection, even Photon Cannon was easily dodged.

'This is really strange. Sound-based magic is highly specialized. How can Marsha, who's from a mercenary background, use sound magic?'

Sound-type mages spend their entire lives studying and collecting only sounds.

Even if they encountered an opportunity, it was demanding magic that required academic knowledge to achieve omniscience at all.

"You're making quite the expression. I can clearly see the emotion of 'How can someone like you?'"
