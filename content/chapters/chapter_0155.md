When Marsha fired her sonic cannon again, Shirone pressed his palms against his ears. At this moment, no magic would be more effective than simply blocking his ears.

"Aaaaargh!"

But Shirone's expectations were spectacularly wrong.

A sonic cannon of completely different magnitude penetrated through the back of his hands. If he hadn't covered his ears, his eardrums would have burst.

"Phew, you're underestimating your big sister too much. I may not have gone to school, but I know how to use progression formulas."

According to magical society's classification, Marsha was from a non-magical school background, but she was also a veteran who had taken down countless mages. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say she had learned the important theories for real combat through experience.

"Banshee's Scream."

As Marsha vibrated her Spirit Zone, a strange sound like elongated notes filled the room.

Shirone jumped up in fear at the sudden phenomenon. He couldn't see anything. The world was pitch black as if someone had painted over his retinas with ink.

'What is this? What kind of magic is this?'

Sound mages travel the world collecting all kinds of sounds. Among them, banshees are winged humanoid monsters that live in mountainous regions, characterized by having the upper body of a woman.

They emit distinctive high-frequency sounds to blind their prey before devouring them. Marsha had used sound magic to perfectly mimic that frequency range.

Shirone grew anxious. He couldn't detect his opponent's position with his Spirit Zone.

The narrow space was chaotic with sound wave reverberations, and Marsha herself could only be sensed as sound, being the epicenter of the sound waves.

While Shirone's senses were paralyzed, Marsha had somehow approached his side. She extended her palm toward his ear. A direct hit from a sonic cannon at this distance would stop his brain functions.

'Farewell, Shirone.'

At that moment, Shirone's zone vibrated violently. Marsha, who had detected the crisis with her sonar sensitivity, immediately retreated. Simultaneously, a photon burst exploded outward, pushing away the furniture in the room.

With his eyes tightly shut, Shirone surrounded himself with lasers in all directions.

Rapidly swirling lasers couldn't deliver much impact, but Marsha, who had confirmed their power at the first gate, crouched under a desk.

Hidden behind cover, Marsha couldn't see ahead with her eyes. But using her sonar detection ability, she could clearly sense what Shirone was doing.

'Huh?'

Marsha's heart dropped. Shirone was concentrating a Photon Cannon right in front of him, aimed precisely in her direction.

How was this possible? In a narrow room, the echoing Banshee's Scream shouldn't disappear so easily.

Marsha remembered the laser that had swept around the room.

'No way? Did he cut through the sound?'

Sound wave vibrations aren't something that can be disrupted by ordinary magic. But with a high-efficiency energy amplification system like laser, it was possible to cut through sound waves.

Marsha didn't know the principles behind lasers, but Shirone understood the principles of sound. The difference in adaptability that arose from this knowledge gap was exactly why magic schools taught numerous subjects beyond one's major.

"Damn it...!"

Shirone opened his clear eyes wide and fired a Photon Cannon at Marsha's location. At the same time, Marsha sprang out like a flying squirrel and rolled to the side.

KABOOOOM!

A heavy sphere of light penetrated through the building's wall and extended outward.

* * *

The battle in the forest was like a war.

Freeman's subordinates clearly had the wrong idea about the cost of magic bullets. Not knowing their value, they kept firing their guns, completely destroying the landscape of the surrounding area.

But those being cornered were actually them. Their number, which had been twenty, had dwindled to just seven. Even so, they still couldn't locate Amy's position.

"Damn it! Where the hell is she?"

"There! She just passed by over there!"

A burning stone flew from deep in the forest. It struck a gunner directly in the back of the head before he could turn around, knocking him unconscious even while his Schema was active.

"Damn it! She's deliberately using fire-based magic."

"She's like a ghost. Moving that fast but still incredibly accurate."

What mattered most for gunners was mobility and accuracy. Amy was overwhelming them in both aspects.

Her ability to stably use Fly magic and her near-perfect targeting accuracy were both because she was the owner of Insight.

"Phew, six left now. No wait, seven including Freeman."

Amy floated more stones into the air around her. The stones glowed red-hot and then burst into flames like lava.

While photon-based magic had photonization theory, flame-based magic had ignition theory. Called Ignite, it formed the foundation of flame-based magic.

The properties of flames that could be created with Ignite were divided into five main categories.

Heat that generated warmth, Flare that lit fires, Burn that set objects ablaze, Blaze that burned wide areas, and Buster that caused explosions.

Heating stones with Burn-type flames was called Fire Call, a magic that made rocks burn like lava before hurling them.

For flame mages, the Burn category was important because it could compensate for flame magic's weakness of being lightweight. That made it perfect for dealing with gunners who operated Schema.

"Shall I go again?"

Rising into the sky, Amy mercilessly rained down Fire Call attacks.

Compared to Meteor's meteorite bombardment, it was child's play, but for those on the receiving end, it couldn't help but be terrifying.

"Above us! Everyone fire!"

The gunners raised their guns skyward and fired magic bullets. But Amy, who adjusted for errors using self-image memory, was toying with her enemies in terms of both evasion ability and accuracy.

While anyone could easily learn Fly magic, maintaining balance in mid-air where atmospheric conditions constantly changed was no easy task.

Yet Amy floated in the sky as if stationary. Her pupils, rapidly backing up her self-image at tremendous speed, were quickly flashing red light.

With each exchange of fire, the enemies' numbers decreased one by one.

When only two of Freeman's subordinates remained, Amy unleashed all her remaining Fire Call attacks.

This time, precise aiming wasn't even necessary. The burning stones struck with thudding sounds into the heads and backs of enemies trying to turn and flee.

Only then did Amy cancel her Fly magic and land in the clearing.

Twenty gunners had been annihilated in an instant. Now only Freeman remained.

"Your subordinates got taken out but your expression hasn't changed at all. Isn't that too cold? Or are you a coward?"

"If disliking fighting makes one a coward, then perhaps I am."

Amy frowned at Freeman's words. If this was psychological warfare, it was quite an advanced technique.

But Freeman didn't care what she thought.

-Freeman is coming. Coward Freeman is coming.

-If you make Freeman cry, Marsha will come. What a pathetic guy who needs help from a woman.

Freeman, recalling old memories, spoke unexpectedly.

"Let's stop this."

"What? What did you just say?"

Amy was dumbfounded. With victory right before her eyes, he suddenly wanted to stop? Moreover, such talk showed no respect for his subordinates who had fought risking their lives.

"I'm worried about our leader. I think I need to go check on her. I don't want her to fall."

"Hmph, nobody wants to lose. You should have lived righteously from the beginning."

"That's not what I mean. She absolutely must not be defeated. Even if it means dying."

"What the hell are you talking about?"

Freeman didn't answer Amy's question. He was just muttering to himself as if talking only about his own story.

"Our leader is strong. Your friends might die."

"Hmph, Shirone is stronger. He'll never lose to a woman like that."

"How pure-hearted. It's good that you believe in your man, but you'll regret it."

Amy seemed displeased at being mistaken for having pure romantic devotion and shouted while raising her fist.

"Don't be ridiculous. And I'm stronger than Shirone, you bastard. I absolutely can't let you go, so you'll have to fall right here."

"Is that so."

Realizing negotiations had broken down, Freeman gripped two guns in both hands and activated his Schema.

His figure, which had been looking at Amy, blurred like an afterimage and then disappeared.

Amy couldn't even react. But sensing a presence behind her through her zone, she hastily twisted her body.

Freeman's kick grazed past the tip of her chin. Amy bit her molars with a troubled expression.

'Damn... I made a mistake!'

Since he was a gunner, she had expected ranged attacks, but he had approached for close combat instead. His mindset was definitely different from his subordinates who had relied only on magic bullets.

"Hmph! I'll take you on seriously too!"

As Amy corrected her disheveled stance, Freeman leaped into the air and fired magic bullets in rapid succession. Fireballs utilizing explosive force fell toward Amy like a dotted line.

But Amy also fired Flame Strike in rapid succession, neutralizing them all.

In infinite coordinates, matching points and lines was an extremely difficult task. The precision of both combatants could be called neck and neck.

The two, clashing again on the ground, engaged in an ultra-close-range firepower duel. But as expected, gunners had the advantage at close quarters.

"In that case...!"

Amy deployed Fire Mist, a defensive magic. Hot winds blew as reddish smoke enveloped the surroundings like a gas cloud.

As Freeman escaped outside the range, Amy fired Flame Strike in rapid succession to end it here. Over ten flame spears charged forward, burning the air.

Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-BANG!

But this wasn't the end. Repeatedly using teleportation to circle around Freeman, she endlessly hammered him with magic.

As dozens of Flame Strikes converged on a single point, Freeman's eyes widened as he opened his Schema.

Compound Eye, one of the eye techniques.

The scenery Freeman was viewing became fragmented as if seen through insect eyes.

As individually analyzed information arrived, Freeman's waist bent back and forth like a willow branch.

The consecutive Flame Strikes didn't even graze his collar as they crossed past in chronological order, each following the next.

Amy intuited this was no ordinary technique. While it couldn't compare to Insight, it was definitely an eye technique specialized for gunners.

She changed strategy and hid in the forest. Since her opponent was a high-level gunner, she had no chance in close combat.

However, Amy had another specialty: sniping. Having distanced herself to a point 300 meters away, she observed Freeman. She could see him calmly opening his cylinder to replace magic bullets.

'Hmph, let's see how long you can stay so relaxed.'

Amy transformed her targeting-type Spirit Zone into sniper mode. The zone extended in a cone shape, aiming at Freeman's face.

Due to the nature of Fire Strike, its power amplified as distance increased. This was because of the air tunnel effect, which could also be considered a characteristic of wind magic.

Using air pressure, objects could be accelerated as they flew. A Flame Strike fired from 300 meters would have nearly four times the power of one fired at close range.

As Amy cast her magic, the flame spear was sucked into the air tunnel and charged toward Freeman.

At the point where it had covered 200 meters, Amy thought it was over. At the current acceleration rate, the speed for the remaining 100 meters would exceed four times that of the previous 200 meters.

Ultimately, Freeman could never react in time.

As expected, Freeman didn't move. But Amy was shocked. The Flame Strike had struck a point far away from Freeman.

'Did I make a mistake?'

At that moment, Amy realized it. The strange sensation that had infiltrated her mind.

"Anti-magic..."

Freeman's gun definitely had anti-magic enchanted on it.

From what she could sense, it was only about 3 percent, but when the distance extended to 300 meters, the margin of error would inevitably become enormous.

Anti-magic was dangerous for her. Since it directly affected her zone, it was magic that even Insight couldn't counter.
