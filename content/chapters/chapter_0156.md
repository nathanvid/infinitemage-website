Amy realized that Freeman was more tactical than she had expected.

A Schema master with Compound Eye, plus 3 percent Anti-Magic that even neutralized sniping.

It was a fighting style that could deploy combat at all ranges—close, medium, and long distance.

"So you were hiding there?"

Freeman flew up holding his gun loaded with magic bullets. The process of stepping on trees while controlling the distance was so fast it seemed disconnected.

The ensuing battle was a chase of hunter and hunted.

Amy continued attempting sniper shots, but hitting Freeman remained distant. No matter how much she backed up with Insight, somehow that 3 percent margin of error always occurred.

If she approached to medium range, she might be able to fight somewhat, but ultimately it would be no different from entering Freeman's home turf.

'This is the only way.'

Amy didn't give up and stuck to sniping. But Freeman, who didn't even need to dodge, was on the verge of yawning.

No matter what methods she devised, it didn't matter. The sniper shots couldn't possibly hit, and if she approached, he could just avoid her with Compound Eye.

"I heard that mages' mental strength has limits..."

While mages had the advantage in early combat since they didn't need to reload bullets, as long as they couldn't cast magic infinitely, the longer time passed, the more the tide of battle would inevitably turn toward the gunner.

When the speed of Flame Strike became slower than before, Freeman began moving in earnest to catch his prey.

Amy no longer had the mental strength left to cast magic. Her head felt bleached. Omniscience wasn't sticking to omnipotence.

"Hah. Hah."

But Amy squeezed out even her last bit of mental strength. And finally cast her last Flame Strike.

Freeman calmly watched the surging magic. As a ballistics expert gunner, he had already realized that the impact point was slightly off.

Freeman raised his two guns and put his index fingers on the triggers. His opponent wouldn't even be able to maintain Fly magic. It was safe to think of her as just an ordinary girl now.

Bang!

At that moment, a powerful impact struck Freeman's temple. For the first time, emotion showed on his face.

Doubt and wonder.

Clearly the Flame Strike had deviated 10 meters from the impact point. But how could a shock reach him?

His thoughts went no further. Freeman, struck in a vital spot, crashed to the ground with a thud. Flames began rising from his face as he lay sprawled out.

'Marsha...'

Amy, who had been clinging to a tree with difficulty as she descended to the ground, finally couldn't hold on and fell on her bottom.

The fatigue was tremendous. Her mind was more exhausted than if an ordinary person had worked all night for four days straight.

But since her gamble-like adventure had succeeded, her mood wasn't too bad.

"Huff! Huff! Done. I won."

In Amy's final attack, the range of sniper mode was actually less than 100 meters.

If Freeman hadn't approached, the Flame Strike would have disappeared before even reaching its target.

But Freeman had charged forward, and that was his fatal mistake. Amy, who had given up the full 200-meter distance, had attempted the Four-Direction Style's deflection form with her remaining mental strength.

She had changed the trajectory using a zone that only held the Flame Strike, striking Freeman directly.

With this method, 3 percent Anti-Magic couldn't avoid the attack.

If she had been throwing stones before, this time it was like hitting directly with her hand.

"Anyway, it's fortunate I won. If I had died, I would have been too embarrassed to even go to heaven."

Since her friends' battles were probably in full swing, she didn't even have leisure to recover her mental strength. Amy took difficult steps toward the cliff, her back bent forward.

* * *

Freeman's face was burning. But he didn't even make a groan.

From the moment consciousness returned due to the pain of burns, there was only one thought in his head.

'I need to get to Marsha.'

Amy's flames continuously burned his skin, but Freeman's body was also repairing cells at a matching speed.

At the crossroads between pain and peace, neither fully alive nor dead, Freeman recalled the days of childhood he had spent with Marsha.

"Oh? It's Freeman. Coward Freeman."

"Droopy-eyed Freeman! Why aren't you crying yet? Cry for us!"

Freeman was always a target of mockery. Because he was a coward.

Of course, no one is born a coward. He thought his seriously drooping eyebrows were the root of all his problems.

"D-don't do that. It hurts."

"That's why we're telling you to cry. When we make you cry, Marsha comes. Pretty Marsha."

"Don't bully Marsha!"

"Stupid, Marsha's the gang leader, who's going to bully her? Besides, Marsha's fun! Anyway, hurry up and cry. Hey, hey."

"Waaaah! Marsha!"

Freeman couldn't hold back his tears and ran away.

The children were desperate to make him cry. Poking his face with tree branches was routine, and sometimes they even threw stones at him.

"Hey! Tell Marsha to come here! We're going to play war games together."

The children made Freeman cry to play with Marsha. Even so, Freeman always ran to Marsha's house.

For someone who was ostracized, her house was the only place he could go.

He felt it every time he visited—it was a desolate house. Her father, a mercenary, didn't even bring furniture into the house. When he went out for work, he often stayed out all night, and when he returned, he would always beat Marsha at least once.

When he opened Marsha's door, she was sitting in a corner of the empty room.

In a room without a bed, desk, or even a common blanket, only leftover bread and a glass of milk occupied the space.

"Marsha, *sniff*, the kids hit me."

She always cut her hair short. But she had a pretty face. Marsha welcomed Freeman with a gentle smile.

"Geez, don't you get tired of always getting picked on? Why do you hang around with kids like that?"

"I don't hang around with them. They find me somehow and bully me."

"Okay. I'll go talk to them. Where are they?"

Freeman said while wiping his runny nose.

"Can't you not go? When you go out and your dad comes in, you get beaten."

"I get beaten anyway, so what. I'll tell the kids that if they bully you, I won't play with them."

"No! You don't like playing with those bastards either, but you're forcing yourself to play because of me. I hate seeing Marsha smile at those bastards."

"Oh my, thank you. Then get stronger. Making demands while getting help."

Marsha poked Freeman's forehead repeatedly. Freeman, annoyed by this, ran to the door and spread his arms wide, shouting.

"Still no! Don't go!"

"Why are you like this today? Try shouting at the other kids like that. Wait, do you like me by any chance? Is that why you're jealous of me playing with other kids?"

Freeman's face turned bright red. He was so nervous that he could hear his heartbeat and felt like he might dry heave.

Finding this amusing, Marsha waved her hand and said.

"Hey, it's a joke, a joke. Anyway, your guts are the size of a bean..."

"Yes! I like you! What are you going to do about it? You're just a girl!"

Marsha stared blankly at Freeman.

"Can't I like you? Did I even ask you to like me back? Liking someone is my feeling, so why are you telling me what to do? A coward like me isn't allowed to like anyone?"

When Freeman, who was poor at expressing emotions, shouted with unprecedented excitement, Marsha held out both hands to calm him before things got serious.

"O-okay, I understand. I'm sorry. Of course it's your freedom to like someone."

"Damn it! Really! Even you treat me like an idiot!"

Freeman became even angrier at Marsha's attitude of appeasing him like a child. Then Marsha chuckled and grabbed Freeman's wrist, bringing him to sit in her usual spot.

"I didn't treat you like an idiot. So calm down your excitement."

Marsha wrapped herself in a rag-like cloak and prepared to go out.

Freeman, embarrassed about his outburst, stayed quiet for a moment before sneakily raising his gaze.

"Are you really going to play with them?"

"No, I'll just scold them sharply and come back. Let's play together later."

Freeman's expression brightened at Marsha's words.

"Really? You have to come back quickly!"

"Yeah. If you get hungry, eat the bread and milk. I already ate."

When Marsha left the house, silence returned. Freeman's expression became gloomy again, blending with the scenery of the poor room.

'Ah, I was going to give this to her while saying that.'

Freeman took out a small hand mirror from his pocket. It was something he had bought by earning pocket money through errands for three months.

Marsha had nothing except one set of clothes. Her adoptive father took everything away.

"Still, she's a girl, so she should have a mirror. That man is really strange. Having such a pretty daughter, I don't know why he acts like that."

Freeman smiled at the thought that Marsha would like it. But his reflection in the mirror was not a smiling face at all.

Seriously drooping eyebrows.

Because of these eyebrows, he had earned the nickname "crybaby" since childhood, and after living like that for 10 years, he had really become a crybaby.

"Is it that strange? I think this is fine."

Time passed, and both Marsha and Freeman turned 17.

Freeman was still a coward in the neighborhood, but because he worked diligently, he had a fairly good reputation.

But the only person he seriously associated with was Marsha.

The reason he saved money left over from living expenses was to buy gifts for Marsha.

Of course, no matter how many things he bought for her, her father seemed to take them all away, but Marsha was genuinely happy when he brought her gifts.

Freeman didn't mind spending any amount of money if it meant seeing Marsha smile.

At some point, she seemed to have lost her laughter. He had a vague idea why. The man called her adoptive father had been tormenting Marsha even more severely lately.

Of course, most children grew up in similar family environments.

Freeman too lived hearing his alcoholic father call him an idiot every day.

Then one day, Freeman finally learned the truth. The violence inflicted on Marsha was completely different in nature from what parents did to children.

"Marsha, Marsha?"

It was perhaps fate that brought him to Marsha's house that night. Marsha's face when he met her during the day had been much more depressed than usual, which bothered him.

No matter how much he knocked on the door, Marsha didn't come out, increasing his anxiety.

Freeman had no choice but to climb through the window. Since there was nothing to steal anyway, most windows were open during summer.

"Huh, Marsha? You were in your room? But why didn't you answer..."

Freeman froze seeing the scene in the room lit by moonlight. He saw Marsha kneeling with her soul absent.

A knife was in her hand, and blood dripping from the blade was flowing along the floor toward a corpse.

"M-Marsha..."

Freeman snapped to his senses and ran over. He didn't know where such courage came from, but he thought that if Marsha was out of her mind, he at least had to do something.

"Get up. What on earth happened?"

After grabbing her shoulders and shaking her several times, Marsha regained consciousness.

She looked up at Freeman blankly, then shocking words came from her mouth.

"Dad... tried to assault me."

Freeman was at a loss for words.

He had thought the man was like a pervert because he was quiet and had shifty eyes, but wasn't he still her parent?

When what he had feared became reality, disgusting emotions surged through him.

"Let's run away. Your dad is a mercenary. If his colleagues find out, they'll come for revenge."

Freeman's words were right. Smart Marsha regained her senses immediately upon hearing this. They had to get out of the house as soon as possible.

Marsha suddenly burst into hollow laughter. She realized that since she had never owned anything, there wasn't a single item she needed to pack when leaving this place.

Freeman grabbed Marsha's wrist and pulled her out of the house. The two ran without stopping once until they reached the village entrance.

"Huff! Huff! Now it's okay. I think we can feel safe for now."

"Yeah. They probably won't chase us outside the village."

Marsha panted as she calmed her mind. Although she feared her adoptive father's colleagues, she was confident she could run to the ends of the earth.
