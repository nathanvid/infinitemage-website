"Freeman, thank you."

"Hehe, what's the big deal? Let's get out of this awful place quickly. No matter where we go, I can support at least one person like you."

Marsha was flustered by his unexpected words. Then, realizing that the time had come, she spoke in a sad voice.

"Freeman, I'm sorry. I'm leaving alone. I won't be taking you with me."

"What? Why? What's a woman going to do alone out there? The outside world is dangerous."

"It's okay. I feel like I can do anything now."

"No! I don't want that! I'm coming with you! You absolutely cannot go alone."

Marsha thought it over one last time. But no matter how much she considered it, she couldn't take him with her.

Freeman had a family.

Even though his father was no different from her own adoptive father, he was still his real father, connected by blood.

"Freeman, I don't love you."

Freeman's face flushed at Marsha's blunt words.

"Wh-what are you suddenly saying?"

"You're a really good friend. But I will never accept you as a man. Following me would be unfortunate for you too. I might marry another man."

Freeman felt as if his heart was being torn apart. Cruel. So cruel, Marsha.

How could she say such things in this situation? When this might be their last time together?

Freeman clenched both fists and gritted his teeth.

If that's how Marsha felt, then so be it. Hovering around her would only result in him getting hurt in the end.

"I don't care. I'm still going with you anyway. I'm also sick of living while being called an idiot by my alcoholic father. This is my decision."

Marsha became angry. Freeman's frustrating personality was so annoying she felt like she was going crazy.

"You idiot! Why can't you understand? I said I don't like you!"

"So what? If you don't want to like me, then don't! I'll just like you anyway! I don't care if you marry another man or have children! I just like you! You don't have the right to tell me not to do even that!"

Marsha also shouted back in fury.

"Oh, really? How wonderful. Go ahead and spend your whole life staring only at me until you die a lonely old man. Should I tell you the truth? You following me would be a burden. How long do I have to take care of a coward who can't even kill an ant? It would just make things harder for me!"

"I'm not a coward! I'll protect you!"

"Then how exactly are you going to protect me! What can you even do?"

"Aaaahhh!"

Freeman screamed toward the ground. Then he picked up a sharp stone he saw and began scraping his eyebrows.

Marsha was startled and tried to stop Freeman.

"What are you doing, you idiot!"

"Let go! Let me go!"

Freeman was unstoppable.

The sound of skin being scraped away made her shudder. Marsha watched the scene in disbelief.

Freeman rubbed the stone until his eyebrows were completely scraped off, then threw it on the ground. When he stood up again, his face was covered in blood like a demon.

"How's this? Now I look scary too, right? I was only a coward because of my eyebrows. Now no one will be able to mess with me. So I won't be a burden to you either."

"Are you... insane?"

Marsha was so dumbfounded she couldn't speak. But Freeman was serious.

With his eyebrows shaved off, his expression was certainly frightening, but in reality, he was making the saddest face in the world.

"I'll get stronger. I'll become strong no matter what it takes. So can't you just let me stay by your side? I promise I'll never ask you to like me, so can't you let me come with you?"

"You... Ugh, you idiot."

Marsha let out a deep sigh. She thought this wasn't right, but even that thought was swept away by her sigh.

"Marsha."

Freeman's eyes suddenly opened wide. His face, which had been disfigured by burns, had somehow completely regenerated.

How much time had passed? Perhaps it was already too late. But he had to go. He had promised. Until Marsha died, even his life wasn't his own.

"I'm coming now. Wait for me."

The energy he had poured out to return to life from the brink of death had been tremendous. His body was heavy and his legs had no strength.

But Freeman walked without rest.

Toward where Marsha was.

**Clay Marsha (1)**

Amy ran up the mountain path, gritting her teeth. Her mental strength had recovered enough to think, but it was still too much to cast magic.

But she couldn't slow down. The battle wasn't over yet. She had dealt with Freeman, but there was still another formidable enemy remaining—Falcoa.

"Huff! Just a little more!"

When the destination came into view, Amy picked up even more speed. And finally, when she climbed up the hill, she encountered an unexpected sight and opened her eyes wide.

Rian, battered and bruised, was holding Falcoa from behind.

But the reason Amy was surprised was something else.

Tess was running at full speed and thrusting her sabre into Falcoa.

Tess's eyes were fiercer than ever before. At this rate, even Rian would be pierced by the sword. But the two had already reached some unspoken agreement and showed no hesitation.

Finally, Tess's sabre pierced through Falcoa. Rian's pupils dilated and his shoulders convulsed.

A moment later, blood burst forth from Rian's mouth with a splurt.

* * *

Twenty minutes before Amy arrived.

Falcoa's attacks were the epitome of brilliance. But it was not skill that showed—it was the beast-like violence that emerged from savagery.

Rian couldn't think about technique. Just enduring the impacts had already exhausted his stamina to the limit.

Falcoa found an opening and slashed Rian's thigh.

He heard Tess's voice shouting 'Rian!' Rian had held out better than expected, but with his lower body injured, half his strength was gone.

Angered by his friend's injury, Tess attempted an attack. But Falcoa truly deserved to be called the Demon of the Battlefield.

As if it didn't matter where he got hurt as long as he didn't die, he concentrated most of his movements on attacking.

This actually reduced the frequency of Tess's attacks. It was a moment that proved anew the maxim that attack is the best defense.

As the battle progressed, more and more scratches appeared on Rian and Tess's bodies. They were avoiding fatal wounds, but like clothes getting wet in drizzling rain, after ten minutes their bodies had become almost like rags.

"Kahahaha! Is this the end now? It was fun for once."

Ignoring Falcoa's words, Tess looked back at Rian, who was breathing heavily.

"Rian, are you okay?"

"Yeah, I can hold out. How about you?"

Tears welled up in Tess's eyes and she couldn't continue speaking. What did he mean he could hold out? Clear traces of Falcoa's sword were carved all over his body.

She had never been so upset in her life. What was that piece of trash anyway, to inflict wounds on Rian?

Tess gripped her sabre's handle tightly. Even if it meant giving up her life, she intended to cut off Falcoa's breath.

"Hyaaaaa!"

Tess pulled her sabre toward her body and charged. It was the charging stance unique to the Elzaine family.

But the gap in strength couldn't be filled even with secret techniques.

Tess's forward speed was tremendous, but Falcoa was backing away at an even greater speed.

Once he had created distance, his intention became clear at a glance. Falcoa, who had wickedly split his lips into a grin, suddenly kicked off the ground and charged forward. Then with smooth skill, he deflected Tess's sabre.

"Hueok!"

Falcoa circled around to Tess's side and struck her ribs with his knee. As her lungs were compressed, Tess's breathing was momentarily cut off.

"Heh heh, not bad. But you still smell green."

Falcoa's longsword fell toward Tess.

Tess felt as if time was slowing down. She could clearly see the trajectory of the sword coming down to cut her neck.

But she couldn't move. As much as time had slowed, her body had also slowed accordingly.

'Sorry... Rian. I wanted to at least get one hit back.'

At that moment, Rian charged like a bull and tackled Falcoa.

"Uaaaahhh!"

Falcoa's legs floated up. But Rian's tackle was a failure. Even while floating, Falcoa maintained his balance with terrifying skill, landed on the ground as he was, grabbed the back of Rian's neck and drove his knee upward.

"Kueok!"

The impact pierced through his solar plexus, passed through his stomach, and burst out through his back.

Was this the combat ability of a demon who had lived obsessed with war? It seemed like there was no way to shake Falcoa by any method.

"How pathetic. Don't worry too much. I'll take good care of your woman."

Rian's consciousness, which had been fading, returned. Though they usually bickered, Tess was a good friend. She was someone he respected and acknowledged as a swordsman.

"To a bastard like you..."

Rian grabbed Falcoa's collar and pulled with all his might, as if burning his entire body.

"I won't hand over my friend, you bastard!"

"Kueuk!"

Even while being dragged by Rian like he was swept away by waves, Falcoa was puzzled. He knew Rian was strong, but not to the extent of matching his own Schema.

So where did this sudden strength come from?

Rian circled behind Falcoa and applied a wrestling technique. With his arms locked under Falcoa's armpits, Falcoa's arms were lifted and he couldn't swing his sword.

"This bastard!"

Falcoa expanded his latissimus dorsi and brought both arms down. Rian's nose bridge contorted. It was as if ropes were tied to his shoulders and horses were pulling him—his body was screaming.

"Keuuuuu!"

But Falcoa couldn't break free.

It was definitely strange. The opponent he had experienced in battle wasn't stronger than him in brute force. So how could he produce such strength?

"Damn! This bastard! Let go!"

"Heh heh! Try to escape. This is what's called Imagination Schema, you bastard."

Mages train the mind, swordsmen train the body. But even for swordsmen, whose ultimate goal is enhancing physical abilities, there was one organ closely connected to the mind.

The brain.

Perhaps thoughts could also influence the body?

Though very few in number, some Schema users dedicate their entire lives to restoring the brain's patterns.

Rian didn't know it, but the name Imagination Schema had been coined by them.

Could the thought of not letting Falcoa go influence his body? If so, would the effect also vary according to the intensity of the thought?

If all this was possible, and since thoughts had no limits, then how much could the effect be amplified if thoughts were strengthened to the extreme?

Rian thought he shouldn't move. He had given his body a specific command and locked it in that state.

A kind of mental lock.

Though the prevailing theory was that Imagination Schema wasn't actually a Schema, Rian's current tremendous strength couldn't be explained any other way.

"Uaaahhh! Let go! Let me go, you bastard!"

Falcoa shook his body frantically. It didn't feel like he was being held by a living being. Rian's body wasn't budging an inch, as if it had been petrified.

"Tess! Stab him!"

"B-but..."

Tess realized what Rian was saying. It was a rational judgment. If not now, there would be no chance to defeat Falcoa.

But Tess couldn't make the decision. To kill Rian? She'd rather die together than stab him with her own hands.

"Rian..."

"Uaaahhh! Hurry! I can't hold out much longer!"

Danger signals were coming from all over Rian's body. His body was simply carrying out 100 percent of the mental command, but the limits were clear. If Falcoa broke free, Rian's body would probably be in pieces afterward.

"Tess! Hurry up!"

"Hyaaaaa!"

Tess charged forward with tears streaming down her face. Rian was risking his life to complete his mission. If she missed the timing due to foolish emotions, she would make Rian look like the world's biggest fool.

It was at that exact moment that Amy arrived.

"Tess! Don't do it!"
