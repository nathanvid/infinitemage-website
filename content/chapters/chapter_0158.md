The moment Amy's shout erupted, Tess's thin sword pierced Falcoa's heart. Following that, Rian's eyes widened as blood burst from his mouth.

There was no mistake in Tess's swordsmanship. The saber had accurately penetrated Falcoa's heart, and his functions would soon cease.

Falcoa sensed his death. He wasn't particularly afraid. Perhaps death was the closest thing to the most pleasurable drug in this world.

"Marsha."

The last word that came from Falcoa's mouth as he faced death was surprisingly the leader's name. As if experiencing a panoramic life review, the corners of his mouth faintly curved upward.

'Take me to the battlefield.'

When Tess pulled out the thin sword, Falcoa's body fell backward. With a thud, he collapsed, and then Rian, unable to endure the physical pain, fell to his knees.

"Rian! Are you okay?"

Amy rushed over frantically. Rian forced a smile as he looked back at her.

"Hey, Amy. Did you finish off everyone?"

"Tell me. Where and how are you hurt? Tess! No matter what, how could you stab them both together?"

Amy shouted at Tess with disappointment. However, Tess was merely wiping the blood off his thin sword. Then he suddenly smiled and winked.

"Hehe, what are you talking about? What do you take me for? I'm confident in distance control, you know. I only stabbed Falcoa's torso. Rian is unharmed."

Amy looked at Tess with a bewildered expression.

"Um... Rian's chest is bleeding?"

"What?!"

Tess's eyes widened as he examined Rian. As Amy said, thin streams of blood were trickling out.

"Rian! Rian! Are you okay? Get a grip!"

As Tess, whose face had turned pale, buzzed in his ear, Rian momentarily lost consciousness before returning, waving his hand dismissively and getting up.

"Don't make a fuss. It just went in a little."

"Sorry, Rian. I lack skill..."

"Don't say that. If it had been even slightly shallower, Falcoa wouldn't have fallen. Then we both would have been in danger. Your judgment was correct."

"Hiiing, but still..."

Rian truly thought so. No matter how worried about a friend's safety, deep was better than inadequate. That's why Tess had been able to achieve maximum concentration.

"Come on! This level of wound is nothing. Let's go quickly. I'm worried about Shirone."

Even during their intense fight, eerie sounds and explosions had been heard from inside the building. He was clearly fighting the leader. At minimum, a more dangerous situation than Falcoa's battle was unfolding.

At that moment, the building's wall burst open with a bang as Shirone came flying out.

"Shirone!"

Just before crashing into the ground, Shirone cast Teleportation and retreated 10 meters. As his photonization state was released, Shirone took a landing posture and slid across the ground.

"Shirone, are you okay?"

"Don't come!"

Shirone shouted urgently. The fact that the always-calm Shirone was unusually excited made his friends freeze as if nails had been hammered into the soles of their feet.

"It's not over yet. It's sound magic, so it's dangerous if you approach."

Marsha's sonar could freely utilize both targeted attacks and area attacks. If the three people, who were surely exhausted from battle, came closer, they would definitely get caught up in powerful sound magic.

"Not bad. For facing me, you've lasted quite a while."

Marsha, who had bent down and exited the building, approached with a smile. However, her smile slowly faded when she saw Falcoa's corpse.

Falcoa was dead.

Although he was a man with some mental issues, the outcasts had gathered together and truly lived it up. The name "Parrot," which had made a name across the continent, was infused with 30% of his blood.

'You won't have regrets, Falcoa.'

Marsha could tell without looking. He was a man who would have thought dying at the end of sword fighting was far more stylish than dying of heart failure from drug abuse.

But the sentimentality ended there.

It was unexpected that he had been defeated by mere students, but considering Falcoa's physical condition after five years of drug addiction, it wasn't an unusual situation.

Marsha focused again on facing Shirone. As she had suspected when he broke through the first checkpoint, facing him directly confirmed that his combination of magic was quite balanced.

His Teleportation was high-level, and the power of Photon Cannon, his core attack method, was also satisfactory.

The laser was perfect as a siege weapon, and while the defensive magic Berserk had the disadvantage of requiring timing, it had the advantage of being convertible to attack magic when necessary.

The balance that one mage had achieved through long contemplation and evolution.

What pleased her most was that it was unique magic that only Shirone could use, which couldn't be learned from any other mage.

'Unlocker magic, huh. Interesting. I want it.'

While Marsha was thinking such thoughts, Shirone was also analyzing the variables in the open field situation.

Since he had received numerous penalties inside the building, there weren't particularly any disadvantages. Most importantly, since there was no risk of hostages being hurt, he could freely increase his power.

"From now on, it will be different. I absolutely won't forgive you."

"Hehe, Shirone, you will forgive me."

"On what grounds? What you've done crossed the line of human decency."

"Well, about that, actually..."

Marsha stuck out her tongue like a mischievous child and shouted.

"It was all lies!"

Shirone's group couldn't understand her words and wore blank expressions. Then Marsha shouted toward the building.

"Yuna! You can come out now!"

Her voice was amplified and spread thunderously toward the sea.

After a moment, the building's door opened and a pretty-looking girl walked out.

"Could it be, that girl is Yuna?"

"That's right, it's Yuna. As you can see, she's been staying here comfortably without any trouble. How about it, Shirone? Are you not angry anymore?"

Shirone couldn't respond. Even with his excellent insight, he couldn't even guess what Marsha was thinking.

"Oh my, still don't get it? Sister just played a little prank on her younger sibling, so why get so angry? Everything I said was a lie. So forgive me, okay?"

Yuna bowed her head toward Shirone's group and said.

"Sister did nothing wrong. Rather, Marsha unni saved me."

Rian opened his mouth in frustration.

"What the hell is going on? Someone smarter than me please answer."

But neither Amy nor Tess spoke.

It was clear mockery. That was certain. The problem was the motive. What intention did Marsha have in orchestrating this?

Shirone was thinking about that very thing.

It couldn't be dismissed as just a prank. The Parrot Bandits had been annihilated. Falcoa was dead. Yet the idea that all of this was lies was unthinkable.

"If that's really true... send Yuna over here."

For now, rescuing Gis's younger sister was the priority. However, Marsha shook her head with her characteristic mischievous smile.

"Yuna, go back inside. I'll send you to your brother later."

Yuna nodded and went back into the building.

Shirone was thoroughly irritated. What exactly did Marsha want to do with this situation?

He could feel neither purpose nor meaning. It only seemed like she wanted to cause chaos like a child.

"What is this? What exactly do you want?"

"Hehe, why are you like this? Yuna is safe, isn't she? Isn't that enough? Ah, did you perhaps want to take her yourself like some apostle of justice?"

"That's not it, but..."

"Now you understand, right? Sister did nothing wrong. You're the bad one, Shirone. You made me feel disgusted. So I absolutely won't hand Yuna over to you."

Shirone entered his Spirit Zone. Marsha's blade-sharp offensive zone was already aimed at his forehead.

"Hmph! I won't be caught off guard now."

Though Shirone shouted boldly, his mind was truly in chaos. Marsha had removed the motivation to fight. Yet she was still spreading hostile killing intent.

'Stay calm. She's showing hostility toward me. That's reason enough to fight.'

If it was a tactic to deceive the opponent, he couldn't just keep taking it. Moreover, since the hostage was safe, once he entered battle, he wouldn't be pushed back like inside the building.

However, contrary to Shirone's expectations, Marsha released her Spirit Zone. And as if disarming herself, she spread both arms and said to Shirone.

"You can kill me."

Shirone's heart sank. He knew what meaning her words carried.

It was the magic incantation she had memorized every time she was beaten by her adoptive father.

That's why Marsha was sincere. She was definitely asking him to really kill her.

'What the hell, Marsha. Who exactly are you?'

* * *

Magic Association Investigation Office.

Sakiri, a certified 5th-grade mage and investigator, wiped the sweat beaded on his forehead. His sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, and more than half the buttons on his shirt were undone.

Clearly the appearance of someone exhausted. However, the forearms holding the steel club still seemed full of strength, bulging with power.

"Phew, now that I've rested, shall we start again?"

"Grrrr..."

Lucas, collapsed on the floor, made a groaning sound.

The vice-leader of the Parrot Bandit group who had followed Arcane to raid the Magic Association. However, at that time, he had been caught by Siena's freezing magic Absolute Zero and had both legs severed.

He didn't know how many hours he had been beaten.

If he hadn't protected his body with Schema, he would have died long ago from the ordeal.

"Here I go. Grit your teeth."

Sakiri swung the steel club again. Under the pouring beating, Lucas crawled across the floor with both arms before collapsing from exhaustion.

"Aaaah! Please stop! At least ask me something before hitting me! I said I'd tell you everything!"

"Wait. I need to reach a thousand hits, don't I?"

"You crazy bastard!"

Sakiri counted in his mind. Five hits remained. Now four. Three.

Finally, he delivered the final blow to the ribs and threw down the steel club as if satisfied.

The club rolled across the floor with clanging sounds.

"Phew, refreshing. I got my exercise for today."

"Hnnng, why are you doing this..."

Lucas clutched his aching stomach and shed tears.

Though he was recruited when the Parrot Bandits fell to banditry, he had risen to vice-leader position in an instant with his outstanding skills. A notorious villain who hadn't been intimidated even when facing Arcane.

However, before Sakiri, he was like gum stuck to the ground.

Sakiri grabbed Lucas by the hair and threw him toward a chair.

As the roughly thrown Lucas clung to the chair, Sakiri sat on the opposite side of the desk and spoke.

"Sit down quickly. Before I cut off your remaining arms too."

Lucas used both arms to lift his body and barely sat in the chair. Then Sakiri remained silent for a long time, carefully examining the file of documents prepared by investigators.

"Investigator sir, please send me back to prison. I'll tell you where Marsha is."

"No need. What kind of woman do you think she is to still be there?"

"Damn it! Then why the hell did you beat me up?"

Sakiri, who had turned to the last page of the file, slammed the desk in irritation.

"Do you know what kind of criminal I hate most? Murderers? Home wreckers? No, escapees. Does the state look that easy to you? Even with swollen guts, there's a limit - a mere B-grade criminal escaping? Your life is over now. You'll never see the sun again for the rest of your life."

Lucas gulped. Sakiri's words weren't threats but facts.

Just looking at the investigator's nature - saying he'd hit a thousand times and actually doing it - made that clear.

"Anyway, let's begin. You'd better listen well. My daughter is four years old now. She's at the perfect age to show off in front of daddy. But I haven't been able to go home for several days! Let's both try to live. Got it?"

"What do you want to hear?"

"Forget everything else - the woman called Marsha. Tell me everything you know about her."

That was the only information Sakiri wanted.

Clay Marsha. Though she was a political prisoner and A-grade criminal who hadn't caused major disturbances, she was all the more difficult to catch because of that.

The biggest problem was that intelligence reports were scattered and contradictory. Sometimes she was said to be a fire mage, other times she was reported to use ice magic.

From that perspective, she had an extremely cautious and meticulous nature. Even deploying investigators to their maximum capacity, they couldn't clearly trace her movement routes.

That's why Sakiri had summoned Lucas. He thought the operation had been wrong from the beginning.

What they really needed to know wasn't where Marsha was, but Marsha herself.
