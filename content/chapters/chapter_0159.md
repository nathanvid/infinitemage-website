"Anything will do. If you spill everything you know, I'll send you back to prison nice and easy."

Lucas remained silent. His quick mind was spinning rapidly.

Lucas, who had joined when they were still the Parrot Bandits rather than the Parrot mercenaries, had no particular loyalty to Marsha. Therefore, confessing what he knew would be easy.

But if he confessed here, he'd be locked away in a deep underground prison until he died of old age.

"How about we make a deal?"

"A deal? What kind of deal?"

"I'll tell you everything about Marsha. In exchange, reduce my sentence. If you just let me out before I die, I'll give you all the information you want."

"Hah..."

Sakiri stared at Lucas with a dumbfounded expression. Then suddenly burst into laughter, stamping his feet.

"Hahaha!"

Crash! The desk toppled over. Sakiri shot up and approached, screaming in rage.

"You crazy bastard! Do you know where you are right now?"

He kicked out, sending Lucas tumbling over with his chair. Still not satisfied, he stomped on the fallen Lucas.

But this time, Lucas was desperate too.

Either way he was dead. If he couldn't achieve his goal here, his life would be over anyway.

"Go ahead! Hit me all you want! I'll never talk! So let's make a deal!"

Sakiri's kicks stopped abruptly.

Why were all the bad guys so shameless? If they didn't want to go to prison so badly, they shouldn't have committed crimes in the first place.

"Ah, this is really driving me crazy."

Sakiri caught his breath and turned around.

Even in his terrified state, Lucas observed his movements carefully. The fact that he stopped kicking meant he was conflicted. If he held out just a little longer, it seemed like a window for dialogue would open.

But contrary to his expectations, Sakiri opened the interrogation room door and gave a terrifying order.

"Hey, disable the magic restriction device here."

The magic restriction device was different from Anti-Magic. It was a technology that prevented the activation of magic itself from the start.

Of course, that too was a form of magic, but there weren't many thieves in the world who could break through magic circles designed by first-class archmages.

Lucas gulped. He mustn't be afraid. This was surely Sakiri's last desperate move too. If he could just get through this crisis, someday he'd be able to return to the world.

Sakiri waited calmly. Soon there was a whoosh as the air seemed to settle.

Lucas couldn't tell what had changed, but Sakiri approached with his head tilted, looking much lighter.

"Tell me everything you know about Marsha. If you conceal the truth or commit perjury, unbearable terror will overwhelm you."

"I won't talk. I absolutely won't talk."

Sakiri paid no mind and extended his hand toward Lucas. Then he calmly closed his eyes and recited words like an incantation.

"As one who judges, I command: word shall answer word. The scales of truth belong only to you."

Lucas's complexion turned pale as a corpse.

He'd been mistaken in thinking Sakiri was just an ordinary investigator. Sakiri was one of those numerous people who should never be crossed.

"Damn it all!"

Ten minutes passed.

"Aaaahhhhh!"

A soul-rending scream echoed through the interrogation room.

Lucas was barely in his right mind. Even when he'd had his leg amputated, it hadn't been this painful.

"Fine! I'll talk! I'll tell you everything, so please stop this!"

The moment he shouted, the pain vanished like a lie.

Lucas, crumpled in a corner of the interrogation room, curled up his body in terror and looked up at Sakiri.

"It's your choice. If you want to be comfortable, confess obediently."

Lucas gave up. Neither keeping silent nor lying was tolerated.

Before Sakiri's magic 'Scales of Truth,' any criminal had no choice but to confess the facts.

"Marsha is clever. And she makes no mistakes. First she pretends to be losing while making the opponent reveal all their cards. But she always lays tricks so they can never hate her."

"Typical con artist methods."

"Heh, con artist? No, she's not a con artist. You know what's scary about her? She doesn't lie to deceive someone. Her entire life itself is a lie. You won't be able to catch her with ordinary methods."

"Hmm, I understand what kind of personality she has. But with just that much, intelligence wouldn't come in so chaotically, would it?"

Sakiri rested his chin in his hand, lost in thought. Then suddenly he recalled one possibility.

Unlike others, he could be certain. Why the intelligence had been going back and forth.

"Could it be? Is she perhaps..."

"That's right. She's the same type of person as you."

With the thought that he no longer had to suffer, Lucas spoke with strength in his voice.

"Marsha is... an Unregistered."

* * *

Shirone analyzed her without regard for means or methods. But he couldn't understand. She was completely different in character from anyone he'd met in his life.

"It's okay to... kill me?"

"Fufu, yes. You hate me, don't you? So feel free to kill me."

Shirone stopped thinking. If he couldn't find an answer anyway, he'd just stick to his beliefs.

"If Yuna is safe, then I have no reason to fight you either."

A faint smile like a crack appeared at the corners of Marsha's mouth.

When an offensive form Spirit Zone came thrusting in, Shirone immediately cast Teleportation.

'Huh?'

Shirone was confused. The Spirit Zone suddenly disappeared and his Teleportation was canceled.

At that moment, the roar of a sonic cannon passed by, making his eardrums burn hot as if on fire.

Unable to withstand the shock, Shirone rolled on the ground, causing Rian to speak with a surprised expression.

"What? Why is Shirone suddenly acting like that?"

Because sonic cannons compress sound waves, the sound doesn't spread widely. Therefore, his friends who were far away had only heard a high-pitched scream.

"That's a sonic cannon. A type of sound magic. But that's not the problem."

Tess agreed with Amy's words.

"Right. Shirone got hit."

A dark shadow fell across Amy's face. Shirone had clearly tried to evade with Teleportation. But just before the magic activated, his photonization was canceled.

"That's not getting hit. It was stolen."

"Stolen? What was stolen?"

Amy could confirm it through synesthesia. The moment Marsha absorbed Shirone's Spirit Zone like dew.

"Probably... mental power."

"That's impossible. How can you steal someone else's mental power?"

Amy hurriedly stepped toward Shirone.

A-class criminal Clay Marsha.

If her guess was correct, that woman was an extremely dangerous person.

"Shirone! Be careful! That woman is an Unregistered!"

Shirone's head snapped up. Though blood seemed to be flowing from both ears from the power of the sonic cannon, making them damp, his Diamond Body mental strength was still solid.

"This is... Unregistered magic?"

"Oh my, you even know about Unregistered? You're really amazing. Education really does make a difference."

Mages develop countless new spells every day without fail, and the association registers them as regulated magic.

But there also exists magic in the world that can absolutely never be registered - that was Unregistered magic.

The omniscience of Unregistered magic is unique.

Rather than actual facts that everyone knows, it constructs omniscience solely from an individual's blind ideology.

In other words, they were mages who could create their own rules and force them on others.

Shirone recalled the story about Unregistered magic he'd heard in Shiina's class.

"Omnipotence is belief. The reason photon speed is classified into four types, flame temperature changes, and plasma can be created even at moderate temperatures is because a mage's omnipotence supports omniscience."

Shiina wrote the words "Unregistered Magic" on the blackboard.

Though students stirred at the appearance of an unfamiliar term, she continued her explanation without concern.

"But there exist those in the world who use omnipotence privately. That is, rather than supporting omniscience, they twist omniscience itself. The magic such people use is called Unregistered."

"Teacher, I don't really understand."

"I'll explain from now on. Everyone, what is my profession?"

"Obviously you're a teacher."

"That's right. I am an educator. Then shall we begin? Is there anyone among you who doesn't think I'm a teacher? Please raise your hand."

Naturally, no student raised their hand. It was impossible. Knowing the fact that she was a teacher while denying it would be contradictory.

"This is precisely the characteristic of the mind. Unlike the body, when a concept enters the mind, it doesn't push it away. Rather, it absorbs it to form a new kind of mass."

Shiina raised her finger for emphasis.

"In other words, others' thoughts can be applied to people, and actually all the thoughts that make us up come from others. Now I'll demonstrate Unregistered magic."

Shiina came down from the platform and stared intently at the students.

"Those who think of me as a teacher all die."

The students murmured. Because Shiina's words were serious, some students tried to deny it, but ultimately it was impossible.

The mind cannot be denied. It only changes.

"Teacher, is this... real?"

"Don't be surprised. I was explaining the mechanism. I'm not an Unregistered user."

Deflated voices erupted from students here and there.

Shiina adjusted her glasses and went back up to the platform.

"Of course, it's not actually this simple. No Unregistered user can kill people by injecting fundamental concepts. Unregistered magic is still magic after all. The principle of equivalent exchange always applies."

A male student raised his hand.

"But there really could be such a person, right? A crazy person who thinks the previous rule is appropriate for equivalent exchange."

"Of course it's possible. But magic is a product of reason. Someone that mentally deranged couldn't handle magic in the first place, and even if they existed, it wouldn't work on you."

"Because they couldn't even penetrate the mind."

"Correct. Therefore, Unregistered magic comes with considerable restrictions and costs. For example, you could make a rule like this: Those who think of me as a teacher must use honorifics with me."

"Aw, that's only natural."

"Right. And this is the frightening aspect of Unregistered magic. Just as this seems natural to you, Unregistered users inject their own rules into others to make them seem natural. Then what about this: Those who think of me as a teacher fall in love with me."

"Haha! That's natural too!"

The children giggled and laughed. Shiina continued without concern.

"Those who love me must unconditionally obey my words."

The children's laughter gradually subsided.

"Those who obey my words must die before me."

Silence fell over the classroom.

"This is one of the techniques of Unregistered magic called constraints. Several constraints are placed to expand the rules. The parts where logic makes leaps are connected through omnipotence. Because they truly believe it, such things actually happen. Therefore, once caught, you cannot escape."

The sound of swallowing could be heard. Was there really such magic in the world? If true, it was a type of mage they absolutely didn't want to encounter.

"But the reason Unregistered magic is truly troublesome isn't constraints but costs. Earlier I said you can't kill people with fundamental concepts, but it's different when costs are involved. I'll demonstrate right now. Those who don't think of me as a teacher die."
