Now the students had become serious. Everyone was staring intently at Shiina.

"But for that person to die, they would have to spend a night with me."

The male students' faces turned red.

"T-Teacher, that kind of example is a bit..."

"There's no need to be embarrassed. I would never do such a thing. I gain powerful abilities by wagering something I absolutely never want to do. That's equivalent exchange. Revealing the price can also become a price itself, but what's important is that the unorthodox practitioner truly believes it. They inject their very personal omniscience into others with the power of omnipotence."

The students finally understood.

An unorthodox practitioner was a type of human whose way of thinking had become completely twisted compared to ordinary people.

"It's not something you can learn just by studying. Mental peculiarity manifested through obsession and bias. Unorthodox practitioners can be said to be the most fearsome existence to mages."

This was everything Shirone knew about unorthodox practitioners. At the time, he thought he understood, but when actually faced with it, he was in complete confusion.

Above all, he couldn't understand why his Spirit Zone had suddenly disappeared. From when exactly? Even if it activated through constraints and prices, Shirone had never done anything to her.

'No, there is! I certainly...'

Shirone suddenly recalled the situation from just moments ago.

-You can kill me if you want.

That was the moment. A magic incantation known only to Marsha and himself.

The moment he uttered those words, Marsha's omnipotence had penetrated his mind and activated the rule.

His heart pounded. He had been caught by an unorthodox practitioner. What would happen to him now? He couldn't predict anything.

'Stay calm. My Spirit Zone has just disappeared. If I keep my wits about me, I can escape this crisis.'

Unorthodox practice was like weighing the value of the possible and impossible on scales. Therefore, the price to be paid was inevitably as great as the strangeness of the ability.

Probably, if he had said "You can kill me if you want," she would have had to endure a defenseless state for quite a long time. If he had attacked then, Marsha would have died.

But why couldn't he attack? Was it because of Yuna? No, Yuna was safe.

His thoughts weren't connecting. What exactly was happening to him right now?

'From the beginning. I was already caught in a trap from the moment I met Marsha.'

The moment Shirone realized that all the events had been scripted under Marsha's direction, he got goosebumps.

Taking him to the tavern, provoking him using Yuna, not touching Yuna at all.

"All for this moment?"

Marsha laughed heartily as if she had seen through Shirone's thoughts. Seeing his bewildered expression made her so happy she could go crazy.

"Hohoho! Of course. Ah, but meeting you was coincidence. I'm someone who turns coincidences into inevitabilities. There's nothing wrong with laying groundwork in any situation. This kind of thoroughness is my charm, wouldn't you say?"

Shirone had to acknowledge it.

She hadn't approached him as a target. She had set up operations with every person she met in life. Based on just the small assumption that they might meet again someday.

This kind of meticulousness was exactly why Marsha had been able to escape the Magic Association's encirclement.

"Shall we begin then? I'm not sure what you'll be able to do though."

Marsha approached Shirone with a leisurely smile. Meanwhile, Shirone couldn't help but feel intimidated. He tried casting teleportation, but it still wouldn't activate.

Surely this state wouldn't last forever. But the concept of stealing someone's mental power was an extremely unfamiliar rule to Shirone.

'This is impossible. What kind of magic like this exists in the world?'

Shirone felt the greatest crisis of his life. Marsha's unorthodox practice was definitely dangerous. It sealed away the Immortal Function itself, which could be called his last bastion.

"Hoho! I'll gladly receive it, your mental power."

All the mental power Shirone had tried to use for teleportation flowed into Marsha. Using that power, Marsha fired another sonic cannon.

"Ugh!"

Shirone turned and ran away. It was a shocking sight for a mage to run with his body in such a situation, but if hit by a sonic cannon while unable to use magic, he could lose his life.

"Huhu, I'll praise you for abandoning your pride. But the fight is already over. Once you're caught by my deprivation."

Unorthodox practice: Deprivation.

She could deprive others of their ownership and steal it. Among these, the magic she had cast on Shirone was called plunder, an ability that stole the mental power of the Spirit Zone.

Shirone distanced himself as far as possible. He had to buy time somehow.

If his mental power was being stolen just for not following the words "You can kill me if you want," then in terms of equivalent exchange, there had to be a time limit.

'Got it!'

As expected, the plunder was released and his mental power returned. Unable to check the situation behind him, Shirone turned around and immediately cast a light storm.

Like thunder striking repeatedly, everything flashed brilliantly in all directions.

The light storm cast with determination in an open field had effects beyond imagination, never mind its power.

"Whew, impressive. Really amazing."

Shirone glared at Marsha. Seeing that she wasn't even approaching, she was definitely looking down on him.

Anyway, if there was a time constraint, he no longer needed to fear plunder. There was no fool who would fall for the same trick twice.

"Here I come!"

Shirone cast teleportation and rushed at Marsha. But Marsha was still overflowing with leisure. And the moment Shirone entered her Spirit Zone, she extended her hand and muttered.

"Unorthodox practice. Robbery."

At the same time, Shirone's teleportation was cancelled. Following inertia, Shirone fell to the ground and slid several meters.

"Ugh! What?"

Once again his magic was cancelled. Had his mental power been stolen again? But his Spirit Zone was still being maintained.

"Huh? Huh?"

Shirone couldn't believe it. Such magic couldn't exist in the world. He couldn't think of the events happening to him as reality.

Watching Shirone's bewildered state, Tess looked at Amy and asked.

"What? Did something happen to Shirone?"

"I don't know. His Spirit Zone hasn't disappeared. But the fact that his teleportation was cancelled..."

At that moment Amy suddenly realized and trembled all over.

No, it couldn't be. It absolutely shouldn't be. Wasn't it too cruel? How much effort had Shirone put in to reach that level?

Amy's ominous premonition became reality. Shirone examined his own body in disbelief and muttered.

"I can't cast magic."

"Huhu, that's exactly it. Unorthodox practice robbery is only possible when caught by plunder. Of course, there's also the constraint that you must see the opponent's magic with your own eyes."

Marsha smiled and kindly explained. Of course, she never conveyed any information beyond mocking her opponent.

Shirone shook his head. It didn't make sense. Even with such constraints, unconditionally stealing the opponent's magic was absolutely impossible according to the principle of equivalent exchange.

"Wow, to have such wonderful magic. I'm so happy. Sound magic was annoying. Thank you, Shirone. You're really a good little brother."

Spheres of light gathered before Marsha's eyes. It was magic that gave mass to light - Photon Cannon.

Shirone hastily threw his body to the side. At the same time, a heavy flash struck where Shirone had been.

Ground debris stung Shirone's face painfully. Being hit by his own magic felt truly terrible.

"Phew, this consumes a tremendous amount of mental power? How did you handle it? Really amazing, Shirone."

Shirone jumped up and glared at Marsha.

This time he couldn't contain his anger. No, it was indignation. The resentment of having all his magic stolen made his body tremble.

"But it's wonderful. The ability of an unlocker."

With a pleased expression, Marsha even showed off a laser, intending to provoke Shirone further.

Watching the laser approach while scraping the ground, Shirone couldn't react at all. Even teleportation had been stolen from him.

At that moment Amy ran over, grabbed Shirone, and cast teleportation. Since her mental power was also at rock bottom, she couldn't move a great distance. Rian and Tess ran over and stood protecting the two of them.

Marsha watched them mockingly.

The swordsmen were a disgrace, Amy was struggling just to cast teleportation, and even Shirone, who had been their only hope, had his magic stolen and became an ordinary boy.

"See? What did I tell you? You can't win fighting against me."

It was certainly a miserable situation. Especially the mental shock Shirone received was enormous. An ordinary person would have cried and wailed while cursing Marsha, then fainted.

"Shirone, pull yourself together. The battle isn't over yet."

"But magic, my... magic."

Shirone's voice was trembling.

Amy understood. If it had happened to her, she might have collapsed from heartache.

To a mage, magic was everything. Just thinking about handing it all over to someone else was horrifying.

"Shirone! Get up! You have to keep fighting!"

Shirone staggered but managed to stand up.

True to his strong mental power, the thought that he must not give up was rising like instinct. But the wound to his heart was too great.

"How exactly? How am I supposed to fight?"

"Think rationally! What magic in the world could steal magic this easily? According to equivalent exchange, there must be tremendous risk involved."

Shirone suddenly came to his senses. Now that he thought about it, that was right. He had been so distracted by having his magic stolen that he hadn't noticed, but Marsha's robbery absolutely couldn't just activate freely.

First, you had to be caught by plunder. And you had to see the magic you wanted to steal with your own eyes. These were certainly troublesome conditions, but even with just these two constraints, Marsha's unorthodox practice was overpowered beyond reason.

Amy desperately tried to convince Shirone.

"If it was easily stolen, it can be easily retrieved. No, it should be much easier to retrieve than it was to steal. That's equivalent exchange. So never give up."

"Alright. I'll try."

Shirone regained his courage. That didn't mean any particular method had emerged, but he couldn't just sit there in a daze and cry.

"I don't really understand what you're talking about, but..."

Rian, who had been just listening until now, spoke.

"If she steals what she sees directly with her eyes, then you can use magic she hasn't seen, right? Like the Wind Cutter magic you showed us at home."

"Ah, that's right."

At that moment, an intense thought penetrated Shirone's mind. That's right. Strictly speaking, from the victim's perspective, robbery was better than plunder. At least he could operate his Spirit Zone.

"Right. I have no choice but to clash with my body directly. Thanks, Rian."

Amy wrapped her arms around Shirone's waist and whispered.

"I'll approach with teleportation. From there, try to do something with Wind Cutter."

Amy cast teleportation with all her might. As the two of them simultaneously emitted light and cut through the air, Marsha also cast teleportation to distance herself.

Magic stolen through robbery only implemented the opponent's omniscience as is, so applications were impossible without knowing the activation principle.

Therefore, even Marsha, who had stolen Shirone's teleportation, couldn't attempt Patrol techniques or Rainbow Drop.

Amy persistently exploited that aspect. With dazzling movements, she approached Marsha and threw Shirone.

Shirone extended his hand toward Marsha and cast Wind Cutter. Since it wasn't his specialty magic, it was difficult to hit without getting close.

But that disadvantage worked as a blessing in disguise. Marsha had distanced herself much farther than expected.

'What?'

Marsha's movement was strange. No matter how unfamiliar the magic, she should have been able to try Photon Cannon or light storm against Wind Cutter.

But she chose to retreat. Very far at that.

"The constraint of robbery is perhaps...?"

One possibility arose in Shirone's mind.
