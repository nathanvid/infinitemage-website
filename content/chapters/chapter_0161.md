"If you make contact with someone whose magic has been stolen, the plunder is undone?"

The mere fact that Marsha gave no response was enough for Shirone to be certain this was the correct answer.

Even so, a sense of unease remained. If the constraint of plunder was contact, then keeping distance was somewhat understandable.

But the problem was that Marsha was in far too advantageous a situation. She had stolen countless magic spells using divine particles, while he had to rely on just Wind Cutter alone.

Wasn't this a situation worth fighting in? Yet she had fled in terror, distancing herself by dozens of meters or more.

'Unorthodox methods...'

Shirone's eyes flashed open. Now everything was clearly organized in his mind.

'Found it! A mental weakness. Marsha isn't perfect either.'

When he thought about it, it was a simple matter. Contact would release the plunder. If she could steal opponents' magic with just that constraint alone, who in the world could defeat her? Ultimately, there had to be an additional price attached on top of that.

He didn't know what price would be paid, but it would be closely related to the trauma that created her unorthodox methods.

'Unorthodox practitioners are beings with mental biases. To possess such tremendous abilities, they must bear the trauma that made those abilities inevitable from the beginning.'

Therefore, she couldn't approach. The moment Shirone found a way to cancel the plunder, the probability of having to pay the price became enormously high.

What she feared wasn't having her stolen magic taken back. What she truly feared was the terrible price that would occur simultaneously with the plunder's cancellation.

'But she must have stolen countless magic spells until now. How did she overcome it back then?'

The answer to that came quickly. As soon as Shirone found the answer, he immediately charged toward Marsha.

This wasn't the time to be thinking. Marsha was buying time until reinforcements arrived.

Ability deprivation obtained by staking her most terrible pain.

As long as there was a risk of Shirone triggering that price, Marsha would absolutely refuse to fight.

Conversely, if it weren't that level of fear, the magic called plunder couldn't even manifest in the first place.

Shirone was no longer afraid. There was still enough time. Somehow, he had to catch Marsha before the reinforcements arrived.

"Ugh!"

Marsha groaned and moved away. Her face turned pale whenever the distance between her and Shirone narrowed even slightly. Her playful tone and charming expressions were nowhere to be seen now.

'I can do this! I can get my magic back!'

Having discovered a ray of hope, Shirone continued pursuing Marsha. Of course, chasing a mage who could cast teleportation on foot was nearly impossible, but he couldn't just stand still with the thief who had stolen his entire life right before his eyes.

"Shirone! It's dangerous!"

At Tess's voice, Shirone looked up at the sky. With thunderous roars, about ten flashes streaked through the air and fell.

Color finally returned to Marsha's face. Meanwhile, Shirone became so dejected he lost even the strength to run.

He had thought there was enough time. But it was a misjudgment. The surviving subordinates had arrived instantly using magic circles.

"Hohoho! They're finally here. It's all over now!"

Nearly twenty Schema users swarmed in and surrounded Marsha. Breaking through those gaps to catch Marsha would be impossible.

"Shi... Shirone..."

Amy bit her lip and swallowed her tears.

Was it really going to end like this? Shirone might have to give up his dream of being a mage.

'This can't be right. I really loved magic. I worked so hard.'

Shirone looked at Marsha as if he had given up everything. It was the most hollow expression a human could wear.

"Oh my, Shirone? Why are you looking at me like that? Ah, because of the magic? It's fine. You're young, so you can learn from the beginning again. Of course, the magic I stole will be unusable even if it takes your whole lifetime."

"The sonic magic was also stolen from someone else, wasn't it?"

"Hehe, that's right. You know I have a habit of stealing. You said you understood me once, so why are you suddenly being so petty? You readily paid 50 silver for the pottery, but you can't give me magic? Why? You pretended to be so kind, but giving magic to others is too, too precious?"

Amy screamed in outrage.

"Shut up! How can you say such things? What did Shirone ever do so wrong to you!"

How could a person be like that? It seemed Marsha intended to not only steal Shirone's magic but trample on his life as well.

"Hohoho! That's what hypocrisy is. There are no good people in the world. They have all sorts of wicked thoughts inside while pretending to care for you on the surface - it's so disgusting I could die!"

Marsha was cursing the world, but to Shirone's ears, it sounded like she was cursing only one person.

Her father.

He had taken in orphaned Marsha and raised her until she was seventeen. But when she realized those long years had been time built from ugly desires, how much despair must she have tasted?

That's why unorthodox methods are frightening. The manifestation of abilities itself uses human trauma as its source.

For ordinary mages, omnipotence is power that reinforces omniscience. But unorthodox practitioners use omnipotence to distort omniscience.

'Because it's so painful, even their ideology becomes twisted. That is unorthodox methods.'

That twisted humanity is implemented in the world through the power of magic. Now he understood why the Magic Association didn't recognize unorthodox methods as magic.

"You're a pitiful person, sister."

Strength filled Marsha's eyes. Who was calling whom pitiful?

Shirone, who had pretended to embrace the whole world with hypocrisy only to have his magic completely stolen, was the pitiful human.

"Hmph! Is this appeasement now? After running at me trying to kill me. You think I'll spare you for that?"

"Actually, I'm not sure anymore. How painfully you've lived."

"Hoho! Finally admitting it! Now you understand? There's no one who understands others' pain! That's human nature! Only bad humans live in this world."

"So... I'm coming to you now."

Marsha's heart sank. There was no way he could come here. Twenty subordinates were protecting her.

"Your words might be right. It might have been hypocrisy. But I still believe there's a way to share pain. If you truly show your wounds. So I want you to show me. I need to see your real pain, not lies."

"Don't talk nonsense. Who's going to receive sympathy from the likes of you?"

"I'm going to break the shell that's imprisoning you. And I'll check directly. How festered your wounds are."

"Don't come! Don't come!"

Marsha screamed with a horrified expression. It was a wound so painful that even a feather landing would make her scream. Yet he wanted to tear that wound open? Not only that, but dig into it with his hands?

"Instead, I promise I'll absolutely never give up on you. I'll embrace any pain for you."

The moment Shirone finished speaking, the subordinates drew their swords and blocked Marsha's front.

"Don't let him come at all costs! Cut off his head."

Looking at the enemies standing like a net, Shirone turned his head and called to Rian.

"Rian, guard my side."

Among the four, Rian was in the worst condition with his injuries, barely able to move. But he got up without complaint and shouldered his straight sword.

Following Rian, Tess ran over.

"Wait! I'll do it. I'm less injured than Rian."

"It's fine, Tess. This is an order my lord gave me."

"But with this body..."

Shirone looked back at Tess and shook his head.

"Tess, only Rian can guard my side. I can't ask anyone else to see blood."

"See, see blood?"

As Shirone slowly moved forward, he spoke to Rian.

"Rian, cut down everyone who comes at me."

Rian didn't understand Shirone's words. His magic had been stolen and he could barely walk. If they entered enemy lines like this, only death awaited.

"Good. Leave it to me."

But Rian obediently followed Shirone's steps. Swords don't judge. If his master commanded it, he just had to stake his life and carry it out.

Marsha couldn't contain her fury.

He wanted to check her wounds? Share the pain together? Nonsense, bullshit.

Shirone was just wagging his tongue without regard for means or methods to get his magic back.

That's what humans are. No matter how much they pretend to show kindness, in the end, they only try to satisfy their own greed inside.

"Kill him! Kill that brat right now!"

At Marsha's cry, twenty subordinates leaped out simultaneously. Enhanced by Schema's physical techniques, they closed the distance instantly and raised their vicious swords overhead.

Rian gripped the handle of his straight sword tightly. He didn't know how long he could hold out, but even if his neck was cut, he intended to keep moving.

The swordsman leading the charge jumped up and swung his long sword down toward Shirone's crown. At the same time, Rian also gritted his teeth and prepared to swing his sword.

But at that moment, the swordsman's body suddenly turned to light and shot up into the sky.

The sharp noise of spatial teleportation split the heavens.

Marsha stared blankly at the scene. Amy and Tess, watching anxiously from the other side, were the same.

"What are you all doing! Attack all together! We absolutely win!"

At the leader's command, three swordsmen launched a simultaneous attack. But they too turned to light and flew into the air before they could swing their swords at Shirone.

Marsha's lips trembled.

Shirone was approaching. With each step he took, subordinates were flying away with thunderous roars.

'What? What on earth is happening?'

The only one who understood the current situation was Amy, the mage. But even she was trembling.

"Amazing. I knew his magical sense was tremendously excellent, but I didn't know it was to this extent."

Since when had Shirone been predicting this moment?

From when Marsha's subordinates came? From when he realized the constraint of plunder? No, probably from when he heard about Wind Cutter from Rian.

"What, Amy? What is Shirone doing right now?"

"That's magic. Slow magic that reduces the speed of time."

Immediately combining theory that had remained only in omniscience with omnipotence was impossible for anyone but Shirone. Honestly, even Amy hadn't expected him to achieve this much.

That's why Marsha couldn't have predicted it either. Shirone's insight, which had lost power while caught up in all sorts of lies and conspiracies, was finally rising to the surface and swallowing Marsha's calculations.

"Slow? That's Slow?"

Tess examined the front again. From the outside, no particular change could be felt. All that could be seen was enemies flying away on thunderous sounds without exception the moment they approached Shirone closely.

But the scene that Rian, who belonged to Shirone's Spirit Zone, was seeing was different.

The moment someone entered Shirone's Spirit Zone, their body flashed with light and began moving boringly slowly.

Those who reached the realm of light-speed could distort the time of their zone. Of course, it wasn't the extreme level of slowing time like Alpheas, but doubling the relativity of time was sufficient at Shirone's level.

'What? Should I just cut them?'

Rian prepared to swing his sword at the enemy approaching slowly. The enemy's pupils were filled with terror. At this rate, death couldn't be avoided. Eventually, he fled using the spatial teleportation magic on his bracelet.

When the enemy ran away before he could even fight, Rian snorted as if it were anticlimactic and followed behind Shirone again.

Screech! Screech! Screech!

The distinctive sound of spatial teleportation could be heard continuously. Now only three subordinates stood blocking Marsha's front. But even they fled when Shirone approached.

Alone again, Marsha trembled with a pale face. Only terrible imaginings repeated in her mind.

"Don't come! If you come, you'll die! If I die, you'll never get your magic back!"
