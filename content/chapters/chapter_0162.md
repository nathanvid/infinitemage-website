"I don't know anymore either. What kind of person are you really, sister? Why is everything a lie? What could you possibly gain by deceiving people like this?"

"Why should I tell you? You're just trying to use me anyway! If you truly cared about me, you'd leave right now! Then I'd believe you! Really! I mean it! So just go!"

"I'm asking you what's actually real!"

Shirone's sharp rebuke made Marsha's shoulders jolt upward.

"Don't just say it hurts—tell me where and how it hurts! That's how I'll decide whether to leave or not! You're painting the world with all these lies, so..."

Shirone approached Marsha closely, raising his fist as he shouted.

"I can't properly see how much pain you're actually in!"

At that moment, an intense shout came from behind.

"Marsha! Noooo!"

Amy and Tess turned around. Freeman, his eyes rolled back, was charging toward Shirone at tremendous speed.

"That's impossible! He definitely took a direct hit to the face."

Amy was shocked as if she'd seen a ghost. The impact of the Flame Strike aside, there was no way someone could come back alive with their face burned by fire.

"Like I'd let anyone pass through...!"

Just as Tess moved to block his path, Freeman leaped up. With incredible jumping power, he soared well over Tess's height, drawing his gun as he flew toward Shirone.

Rian spun around and swung his straight sword at Freeman. Though his muscles ached as if they might tear, if he let Freeman slip by here, all their efforts would be for nothing.

"Uaaahhh!"

The slow magic affected Freeman without exception. It was obvious he would be cut in two by Rian's sword.

But he didn't retreat. He had to protect Marsha. Somehow, he had to separate Marsha from Shirone.

At that moment, both Rian and Freeman froze with identical shocked expressions. Rian's sword failed to cut Freeman, and Freeman couldn't reach Shirone.

It was because Shirone, who had been sensing the situation behind him, suddenly released the slow magic.

The ability to expect the same effect from both on and off modes was an advantage unique to time magic.

Even during this, Shirone's fist was still swinging in a large arc.

Marsha could only watch. The cruel boy's fist coming to shatter everything about her.

Shirone's fist struck Marsha's face. Her head turned, and she collapsed to the ground as if hit by a tremendous impact.

"M-Marsha."

Freeman's face went pale. Marsha too couldn't accept reality. With a blank expression, staring only at the ground, she looked no different from someone already dead.

Shirone realized his magic had returned. In contrast, Marsha's mind now contained no magic whatsoever.

"Marsha..."

Freeman approached with a somber expression. The subordinates who had returned from the spatial teleportation magic circle appeared behind the building. But none of them dared to come closer.

Marsha had fallen. They knew what that fact meant.

"Are you alright?"

Freeman's voice was heavy as he asked Marsha. His jaw twitched visibly as he gritted his teeth.

"Yes, I'm fine."

Marsha forced a smile. Do humans become detached when faced with absolutely unchangeable facts?

Though she was smiling, most of her emotions had evaporated. It was as if her soul had left and only an empty shell remained.

Amy had no intention of sympathizing. This was the very person who had tried to completely destroy Shirone's life.

"You reap what you sow! Surely this isn't the end of it. That ability to steal others' magic—there must be a price waiting for you."

Marsha didn't get angry. That's what equivalent exchange meant. If she hadn't been prepared for this outcome, the magic wouldn't have activated in the first place.

"Yes, the condition for canceling the theft is for someone to touch my body. Then the magic returns. And the price for that is... I have to say this to that person."

Marsha turned to sit facing where Shirone stood. Then she opened her mouth with a terrified expression.

"You may embrace me."

Tess frowned as if dumbfounded.

"Wh-what?"

To think she'd stake something like this when she had nothing else to wager. What kind of woman could be so frivolous?

But Shirone understood. Theft was an ability that could only be obtained by staking a price equivalent to death.

The spell that had forced her to kill her adoptive father that night was a recreation of memories she'd rather die than recall.

Rian, who had finally grasped the situation, spoke with displeasure.

"What kind of price is this supposed to be? There's no way Shirone would do such a thing. What happens if Shirone refuses?"

Freeman answered.

"Then Marsha dies. According to the rules she set, the moment Shirone refuses, she'll lose her life."

When death was mentioned, Tess waved her hands frantically, her words getting tangled.

"E-even so, it's impossible! Where is there such a law? Amy, say something too. This doesn't make sense, right? Right?"

"Don't ask me. It's for Shirone to decide."

Amy's heart was equally troubled. Shirone wasn't the type to hurt a woman like this. But she couldn't know what kind of responsibility he felt while holding someone's life in his hands.

"I understand. I think living would be better than dying. I'll pay the price myself."

Shirone made his decision and stepped toward Marsha. Even Amy's heart couldn't help but race this time.

Freeman, who had been keeping silent, suddenly blocked Shirone's path. His body had moved without his knowing. It was unavoidable pure devotion.

But he ultimately had to step aside.

"Please. Save Marsha."

Marsha was waiting with her eyes closed. She trembled like someone on an operating table for the first time, but part of her wondered if this was how things should be.

The persistent trauma. The hateful memories she wanted to cut out but couldn't because they were hers—if someone would brand them with a hot iron, it might at least feel refreshing inside.

"Freeman, I'm sorry."

Marsha spoke the words "I'm sorry" for the first time. Understanding what those words meant, Freeman bowed his head and stepped back.

Shirone approached Marsha's side.

Trauma is dangerous because it holds both the present and future captive to past events. Perhaps she hadn't truly lived in the future since that day.

"Could we go somewhere private? Please."

"There's no need. Here is fine enough."

Marsha opened her eyes and studied Shirone's expression. But he remained calm as ever.

What could he be thinking? Perhaps he planned to torment her with false hope before killing her.

'Well... I did do such things to him.'

She had stolen his magic and tormented him countless times. Shirone must have experienced the depths of despair. She could understand wanting to vent his anger this way.

Shirone supported Marsha's back and drew her upper body close. She did as he directed. Whatever he demanded, she had to accept it or pay an even greater price.

With Marsha's face nestled against his chest, Shirone whispered softly in her ear.

"I have embraced you."

Marsha just blinked. Then, realizing Shirone's intention, she frowned.

What kind of childish prank was this?

"What are you doing right now?"

"I embraced you, sister. You said I could embrace you."

"Stop playing around. You think this will end it? Are you mocking me?"

"I told you, I'll never give up."

"Let go! I don't want your cheap sympathy! Do you think this makes you look great? Just embrace me properly! You're angry at me! Get your full revenge!"

Due to the rules of the price, Marsha couldn't harm Shirone. But even if she struggled, Shirone had no intention of letting her go.

"Evil boy! Hypocrite! Trash!"

"You're a good person, sister."

Shirone said while stroking Marsha's head.

"You're different from Arcane. I can tell just by seeing how many people follow you. Even if it's false, that's enough. Nobody knows what's really in another person's heart, not even you, sister. I don't know either. We just live believing. Even if you can't trust anyone else, you can trust yourself. If you truly love someone with all your heart, then somewhere in this world, there's definitely someone who will love you back just as truly."

"No! That can't be! What do you know! What gives you the right to spout such nonsense!"

Marsha desperately denied Shirone's words. But when she realized tears were flowing down her cheeks, she stopped speaking with a surprised expression.

Even now, her heart wasn't sad at all. So why were tears flowing?

"Huh? Why is this happening? Why are tears suddenly..."

How tightly had it been sealed that tears flowed before emotions could even open?

But now it was different. As the memories she'd kept in sealed storage rose to consciousness, Marsha finally faced her trauma for the first time.

It was a day when she was seventeen.

Marsha lay on the floor, staring only at the ceiling, as her adoptive father approached reeking of alcohol.

Always the same situation, always the same violence.

Marsha was conscious of the dagger hidden behind her back. Its cold touch seemed to freeze her skin.

"You may embrace me."

Her adoptive father's eyes widened as if shocked.

Marsha still remembered clearly—the monstrous emotion rising in her adoptive father's pupils.

Marsha gripped the dagger. He was approaching. She had no choice but to stab him.

But in this moment, the father she imagined was different from the father in her memories.

The father who lifted Marsha's upper body buried her face in his chest and gently stroked her back.

"I'm sorry for everything until now, Marsha. You are my daughter."

The words she'd wanted to hear most in the world.

The moment she recalled those words, the closed door of her heart opened completely. Ten years of suppressed emotions burst forth, and she couldn't control her tears.

"Sob! Hic!"

Marsha, held in Shirone's arms, burst into heartbroken tears.

"Wahhh! Daddy! Daddyyyy!"

Shirone said nothing. He simply stroked her back.

"Daddy! Why did you do that! I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Daddy!"

This was what she had truly wanted—to be embraced like this. No matter how violent that person had been, she had wanted him, who had taken in an orphan like her, to remain her father until the end.

"It's okay, sister. It's okay now."

Marsha's past was crumbling. It was being reconstructed into slightly stronger memories, transforming into hope that would allow her to live in the future.

"Wahhh! Daddy! Daddy...!"

Freeman checked the time.

It was already past the time when the rules she'd set should have taken effect. But Marsha was still alive.

"What's going on? What's the situation?"

Only the two of them would know what emotions had passed between Marsha and Shirone. Therefore, the others still couldn't let their guard down.

Freeman explained.

"The theft has been canceled. Shirone released her magic."

"That's impossible. 'You may embrace me'—you're saying it really ends just by embracing her? What kind of price is that?"

Freeman hesitated to answer. It was natural for Amy, who didn't know the full situation, to think that way.

But looking deeper, it wasn't a matter of language.

Shirone had opened Marsha's closed heart. He had shattered the shell she'd built with her defensive mechanisms and shown her a new path.

"Shirone didn't cancel the theft. He canceled the very conditions for the theft to activate, severing Marsha's power. Marsha's theft no longer exists in this world."

Freeman smiled bitterly. Perhaps what Marsha's true pain was didn't matter to Shirone from the beginning. He had planned to embrace everything from the start.

'I couldn't do that... This is our complete defeat.'

"Wahhh! Wahhh!"

Marsha's tears showed no sign of stopping. She too understood. If not today, the door might never open again.

Countless memories of living in the past were sinking into the abyss after ten years.

**Late Lunch (1)**

Twenty minutes had passed since the battle ended.

The Parrot Bandits' subordinates sat down to rest, and Rian also received first aid from Tess for his injured areas.

Throughout all this, Marsha was still nestled in Shirone's arms.

No more tears came now. But she trembled intermittently, savoring the afterglow.
