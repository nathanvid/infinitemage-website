"Huff, huff."

Amy, who had been watching this scene for quite some time, finally couldn't stand it anymore and shouted.

"Hey! Can't you just move out of the way? This is getting ridiculous - people watching would think we're the bullies and you're the victim!"

Marsha, who had been looking at Amy, pursed her lips as if to set fire to Amy's chest and burrowed even deeper into Shirone's embrace.

Amy heard the sound of her patience snapping.

"I've been trying to be patient, but this woman!"

Freeman blocked Marsha's path and pleaded.

"Leave her be. She's exhausted from crying."

Amy stared at Freeman in disbelief and pointed at him accusingly.

"Aren't you misunderstanding something too? Do you know how much trouble we went through because of you people? It's only because we won that it ended well - Shirone nearly had his life ruined!"

That was what Amy was truly angry about. Was it enough just because the result was good? If Shirone hadn't overcome today's crisis, what would have happened afterward was too horrible to even imagine.

Not only Shirone's heart after losing his magic, but Amy, who had to watch it all, felt like she had returned from hell.

"I'm sorry. All the crimes committed while operating as the Parrot Bandits were under my orders. Marsha only confronted the Association's pursuers. But if even that is considered a sin..."

Amy crossed her arms and asked back.

"If it is?"

"I'll take responsibility for her life as well."

Marsha, who had been nestled in Shirone's arms, suddenly stood up. Then she stomped over angrily and kicked Freeman in the rear.

"Don't be ridiculous! Who asked you to interfere with my marriage prospects? I don't need someone like you!"

Though Freeman's waist swayed, he still stood firmly in place like an old tree. He was used to Marsha's tantrums from childhood.

"Sister Marsha."

At the sound of Shirone's voice, Marsha's shoulders flinched. She couldn't find the courage to turn around. The reason she had taken out her anger on Freeman was because she was afraid of this situation. In the end, she spoke without turning around.

"Um... I'm sorry about what happened. Of course, I don't expect forgiveness."

"You're right. I can't forgive you, sister."

Marsha turned around with a startled expression. Shirone's gaze was cold. There was no trace of the gentle manner he had shown when comforting her wounds just moments ago.

"No matter what reasons you had, you kidnapped and used a young girl. That's something that should absolutely never be done."

Marsha couldn't argue back and hung her head. She had never bullied the weak in her life. But she didn't want to make excuses. It was because Shirone was the person who suffered the most when Yuna was kidnapped.

"Yes, I suppose so. Now that I think about it, I was truly a villain."

"That's right. You are a villain."

Shirone spoke without hesitation. Come to think of it, that was his personality. The reason he could treat someone sincerely without causing conflict was because his nature itself was good, not because he liked to obscure facts or give false testimony.

"I'll be going. I hope you overcome this well. And... I hope we never meet again."

Shirone turned around without any lingering attachment and walked away. Sympathizing with and understanding Marsha was all he could do.

"I was wrong!"

At that moment, Marsha gathered courage and shouted. Shirone hadn't made any judgment about this incident.

It was the same as when she stole pottery from the market. That's why she had no choice but to approach him first.

"How can you just leave like that? I'm just getting started. You should at least promise we'll meet again!"

Shirone, who had been standing there for a long time, turned around. His gaze was still sharp, making Marsha anxious like a prisoner awaiting sentencing.

"If you truly think you were wrong, apologize to Yuna. Also apologize to her brother Gis for your wrongdoing. You must compensate for all the damage the siblings suffered."

"Of course! Actually, I hate this kind of thing too. I won't make excuses, but I'll ask for forgiveness from both of them separately."

"Even so, that doesn't erase the wrongs you've committed. I can never forgive what you've done until now."

Marsha's shoulders drooped. The tears that had been welling up seemed ready to fall at any moment.

"But if you truly decide to live a new life, I can forget the past."

Marsha quickly raised her head. Then she cried like a child and hugged Shirone.

"Waaaah! I was wrong!"

Shirone couldn't comfort Marsha as she cried in his arms. This was actually the first time in his life he had made such a choice.

Some people live harder lives than others. Not everyone in the world can fight for their beliefs.

That's why Shirone decided to forgive her.

If he was the starting point of her change, he thought he had at least the responsibility to watch over her.

'Clay Marsha...'

Was that why? Shirone suddenly realized.

Marsha, who had seemed only strong and frightening, was actually such a small woman that she could fit entirely in his embrace.

* * *

Marsha led Shirone's group to the building. Since it was the place where two mages had battled, not a single piece of furniture remained intact.

His friends could guess how fierce a fight Shirone had fought.

"Let's go to the second floor. I'm hungry after fighting. I'll cook something for you. My skills aren't great though."

At least the second floor was in a livable condition. Only a few flower pots were broken on the floor.

Shirone's group waited for the food to be served.

Yuna was also sitting there. Perhaps because the tension had eased, her complexion looked much better than at first.

They had left at dawn and hadn't eaten a single meal until the sun was setting. Since their hunger was beyond what could wait for a proper meal, Marsha served soup and bread that could be eaten immediately.

As soon as the food came out, they frantically filled their stomachs. Though Rian's injuries weren't serious enough to prevent eating, he seemed to eat the most among the group.

"Can't you use your unorthodox magic anymore?"

What impressed Shirone most about this battle was definitely the unorthodox magic. Even if it wasn't as rare as being an Unlocker, it was certainly a rare trait in the magic world.

"No, that's not the case. Of course, deprivation would be impossible, but wounds carved in the heart don't heal that easily. It will be modified in some way."

"I see. Hmm."

When Shirone trailed off, the perceptive Marsha smiled brightly and said.

"Don't worry. I won't create such malicious magic anymore. I can change the rules to some extent."

Shirone nodded with a surprised expression. This was also practical information that couldn't be learned at school.

"Then do you have any rules in mind?"

"Not really yet. Let me see... Maybe I should develop magic to enchant handsome blond men who attend magic school?"

Shirone smiled uneasily. Having experienced the eccentricity of an unorthodox magic user, he couldn't just brush it off as a joke.

Marsha, receiving Amy's sharp glare, waved her hands reassuringly.

"Hehe, don't worry. It's not Shirone."

"Oh really? Then who is it?"

"There is one. A handsome blond man who attends magic school."

Amy swallowed her words. It was pointless to argue with an unorthodox magic user who viewed the world according to her own thoughts.

Freeman put down his spoon and said seriously.

"How about magic to seduce men without eyebrows?"

"Pfft!"

Marsha spat the soup she had in her mouth back onto her plate. She never expected him to say something so shameless in this situation.

"What nonsense are you talking about? Is there something really wrong with you?"

"Why? I didn't mention myself even once."

"What other human in the world lacks eyebrows besides you and monkeys?"

"Monkeys aren't human."

"No! I'm saying you're the monkey! Come to think of it, you lost, didn't you? You pathetic coward. How many times did I tell you not to use reverse technique tree? Huh? Huh?"

Marsha poked Freeman's temple repeatedly with her fork.

Watching this, Amy suddenly had a realization. It was certainly strange that Freeman was fine after taking a direct hit from her Flame Strike.

'Reverse technique tree?'

Those who train in Schema stack multiple Schemas to build up. The most basic build forms the foundation, with optionally chosen builds layered on top.

Reversing this in an instant was called a reverse build.

Schema users called this "reversal," and it could be considered a defensive build chosen only when life was in critical danger.

For gunners whose mobility and accuracy were vital, they usually based their builds on sensory or neural enhancements.

Therefore, regeneration-based builds or cellular activation builds related to defensive abilities had to be relegated to options.

Since Freeman was also a gunner, it wouldn't be much different.

But listening to Marsha's words, he had fought from the beginning with a defensive build - essentially a reversal build.

Then it made sense that he was fine even after his face was burned by Flame Strike.

'Come to think of it... his speed when saving Marsha at the end was incredible.'

That was probably his movement as a gunner without reversal. Thinking about it that way made her feel angry.

Perhaps sensing Amy's mood, Freeman said.

"If it hadn't been reversal, the opponent would have used different tactics too. There's no strong or weak. We just do what fits the situation, and courage is also part of skill. Amy was stronger than me. That's all."

Marsha propped her chin and burst into laughter. Cowardly Freeman with his eyebrow complex could now say quite manly things.

Being praised by an enemy made Amy feel awkward.

"Well, you were... pretty amazing too, mister."

"Thanks. But I'm not a mister. I'm the same age as Marsha."

"So what? Even if you're the same age, you're still a mister to me."

Freeman drooped his head gloomily and concentrated on tearing his bread again. The words asking why Shirone called Marsha "sister" rose to his throat, but being timid by nature, he couldn't bring himself to say it.

After the playful atmosphere passed, Marsha straightened her expression and spoke seriously.

"Anyway Shirone, if you're aiming to become a mage, it's best to be wary of unorthodox magic users. Actually, it's pretty funny for me to say this."

"Not at all. I want to know. Please tell me more."

"Hmm, actually the deprivation I used isn't very efficient magic. While stealing someone's magic is overpowered, it's just challenging possibilities rather than being an effective combat method."

Even Shirone thought that if he had to risk his life to gain some ability, he probably wouldn't choose deprivation.

Because there were too many restrictions on the act of stealing others' abilities itself.

"I'm a somewhat special case. Of course, most unorthodox magic users are special, but I didn't create this magic with combat in mind from the beginning. Other unorthodox magic users will use much more effective and versatile unorthodox magic than mine."

"I see. Now that I think about it, it was really chilling when I fought you, sister. I never knew there was a way to block Immortal Function."

"Hehe, sorry about that time. But you're right. Nothing is impossible in the world of magic. Nothing is absolute either. You were able to defeat me because you saw through my weakness, right?"

"Yes. If the activation of unorthodox magic itself stems from trauma, I thought variables might arise if I persistently targeted that trauma."

"Exactly. In other words, it's a logical battle of restrictions and costs. When facing unorthodox magic users, it's more important to quickly understand the mechanism of their magic than their combat power. Of course, I think you'll do well enough."

"Not at all. I learned a lot this time."

Shirone answered sincerely. It was a battle that made him realize the world was vast and there were countless outstanding people.
