"Hah, anyway, I never thought a day like this would come. Maybe now I can live a somewhat different life?"

The wounds weren't healed, but she had definitely cracked the shell. What remained was to carve out a life while vividly feeling the pain of the past.

"What will you do now? I heard there are trackers after you."

Freeman said.

"We'll leave. We started as mercenaries, so we should live as mercenaries. The subordinates will want that too. Of course, in this country we've been ridiculously branded as bandits."

Marsha's eyes filled with sadness. Mercenaries were beings who fought. She too had the resolve that she could die at any time, which was why she could bury her comrades' deaths in her heart and still smile.

She had never fought for a great cause or shallow justice. But she had always been proud and never avoided enemies who picked fights with her.

Marsha wanted to at least give them the title of brave warriors. She thought they shouldn't be buried in graves with the nameplate of bandits like this.

Understanding Marsha's feelings, Tess offered words of comfort.

"Actually, there's only a hair's difference between bandits and mercenaries. In some sense, there's only a hair's difference between knights and mercenaries too. They're all beings who fight for their own beliefs and get buried. Those who are politically defeated become evil, but I think the tide could turn someday."

Rian's thoughts were similar. He wasn't sure about Shirone and Amy, who studied academics, but for someone dreaming of knighthood, this was something to be prepared for.

"Our family also had times when we were threatened. For maintaining neutrality. Come to think of it, your father must be having a hard time too, Tess."

"Yeah, well. Here, father is a hero, but in the colonies he's treated as an invader. That's just how it is. That's politics."

Marsha smiled. She knew that Rian and Tess had deliberately shared such stories for her sake.

Though she still doubted the world, she had come to believe somewhat that truthful people existed.

'They're warm children. Just like Shirone's friends.'

Marsha collapsed onto the table like a lazy cat, propping her chin up. Intoxicated by the long-awaited peace, she lazily raised only her index finger to point at Shirone.

"But what will you all do? Are you going to tour around diligently?"

"Ah, we're going to the Kergo ruins."

"Kergo? What would young men and women do there?"

"Well, actually..."

Shirone explained the reason they had come to the island. Marsha, who had been listening with interest, nodded as if surprised.

"Ho, so there was such a secret in the ruins. Actually, I was away from the island, so I didn't know the details. Freeman, did you know?"

"To some extent. I heard stories from the natives."

"Hmm, I see. So you want to enter the Kergo autonomous zone?"

"Yes. But the difficulty of the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice is too high, so I'm not sure if we can pass through."

"If you can't get in, there's nothing you can do about it?"

"Probably. There is one thing I've thought of, but it's not certain."

Having heard that much, Freeman spoke.

"In that case, we can help you."

"What? The Room of Achievement and Sacrifice?"

"No, even without going through that place, you can enter the autonomous zone. It seems Falcoa made deals with that side through loops. If you show the Freeman organization's pass, they'll let you in. Anyway, he was quite capable in that area."

Shirone's group looked dazed. It was the first time they had heard that they could enter the native autonomous zone without taking the test.

Amy tilted her head and asked.

"Wouldn't the passage be different then? If there were two routes from the beginning, there would be no need to create a trial gateway, right?"

"I don't know about that. What's certain is that both routes arrive at the same place. This is a fact I've already confirmed with someone who entered through the trial gateway."

Hearing this, Shirone was also puzzled. He had expected that passing through the trial gateway would at least send them to a different area.

"It's the same place, but one side requires passing a test. Why would they do such a thing?"

Tess said.

"Unknown. Maybe it's tradition. The older the culture, the more such things remain. Another hypothesis would be to avoid people's suspicion."

"How would that help?"

"It gives the impression that there's nothing special in the autonomous zone. Actually, after hearing the story, we're in a state where our expectations for the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice have decreased, right?"

Freeman concluded.

"Anyway, you'll have to check it out yourself. If necessary, we'll make you a pass. It should be possible right away."

"Yes, please do."

Shirone decided to accept it for now. He hadn't decided which route to use yet, but the more methods to approach the native autonomous zone, the better.

Freeman called a subordinate and instructed them to issue a pass, then spoke to Shirone's group again.

"Getting in won't be a problem, but you'll need someone who can speak the native language. We don't have anyone among our subordinates."

"Huh? Then how did Falcoa make deals?"

"After entering the island, Falcoa built his power independently. Strictly speaking, the existing mercenary band didn't suit him. Of course, with Falcoa dead, his private organization would have collapsed, but at the time he frequently associated with black market dealers on that side. It seems there was an interpreter among them."

"Hmm, then we'll need to find an interpreter too."

Yuna quietly raised her hand.

"Um, I don't know if I should say this..."

"Hm? It's fine. You can say anything."

"Actually, my brother knows a little Kergo."

Amy showed interest.

"Oh my, Gis? How did he learn it?"

"My brother did various jobs to take care of me since we were young. Before becoming a port tout, he also did tourism part-time work and such. I think he learned it then."

Freeman said.

"That's perfect. Then let's ask Gis. We'd like to help, but now that Marsha is back, staying on the island is dangerous. The Magic Association is still chasing us."

Shirone also nodded obediently. He didn't want to burden Marsha, who was being pursued at a national level, any further.

With that, the discussion came to an end, and before sunset, Shirone's group left the building.

Marsha put bracelets capable of spatial teleportation on them.

The usage method was simple. Since the bracelet also had its own Spirit Zone, they just needed to visualize coordinates as if casting magic.

Shirone examined the bracelet Marsha had put on him.

People used it without much thought, but linking magical tools with magic circles was truly an extraordinary idea.

A technology impossible without connecting two Spirit Zones located in different spaces.

This could also be thought of as how the spot Marsha had shown looked when viewed from the outside.

In other words, a person in the spot would only see one hole created in space, but conversely, from the outside, they would discover two spots: an entrance and an exit.

'The maze of space-time. Perhaps this world is already within a vast secret.'

At first, he thought it was a special event that happened to him. But it turned out she was Alpheas's disciple.

Going deeper, he learned it was even connected to the Kergo ruins.

Moreover, space-time magic was still being incorporated into magical tools somewhere and spreading throughout the world.

Shirone suddenly felt a fearful emotion. Perhaps, as the headmaster said, he was now trying to find something he should never know about.

While Shirone was lost in thought, Marsha approached and gave final advice.

"There will be a carriage waiting at the bottom of the mountain. We might be able to see each other once more before leaving, but anyway, be careful. And when you return, make sure to find a healing mage for treatment."

"I understand. Thank you for your concern."

"Hoho! What are you saying, between us?"

Marsha covered her mouth and hit Shirone's arm. She no longer needed to hide herself, but she wasn't much different from when they first met. Perhaps she had lived by revealing herself while putting forward the shield of falsehood.

"I'll be going. If by any chance we can't see each other on the island, please contact the magic school."

"Don't worry. Clay Marsha can find you anytime, anywhere."

Marsha rolled up her sleeves and spoke spiritedly. She was indeed someone who knew how to make others feel cheerful.

Freeman was assisting by her side. It seemed like one side received too superior treatment to call them friends, but somehow this dynamic seemed to suit them well.

As Shirone entered the forest, Marsha, who had been standing guard for a long time, asked.

"The Kergo ruins, huh. Will they be okay?"

"Probably... they won't be okay."

Marsha frowned and looked back at Freeman. But Freeman, as always, spoke calmly.

"But they'll overcome it. Because they're strong kids."

Marsha looked up at the sky with a wistful smile. The sound of spatial teleportation born in the forest split the heavens.

**Dangerous Deal (1)**

When Shirone's group returned to the villa by carriage, it was already evening.

Gis, who had been pacing the living room despite his aching body, turned around as soon as the door opened.

"Ah..."

Tears welled up in Gis's eyes. His one and only sister Yuna was entering the villa safely without a single wound.

"Brother!"

"Yuna!"

Gis embraced Yuna with a tearful expression. The siblings hugged each other tightly and shed tears profusely.

It had been a truly difficult trial for them. Even Shirone, whose mental fortitude was second to none, had moments when he wanted to fall to his knees, showing what formidable enemies they were.

Having been harmed by such people, he could newly feel how desperate and frustrated Gis and Yuna must have been.

"Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?"

"Yes. I'm fine. The brothers and sisters saved me. What's this state you're in? How badly were you hurt to be wearing bandages?"

"I'm fine. As long as you come back, nothing hurts at all."

Actually, Gis could barely walk. But he couldn't show it to Yuna. The fear Yuna must have felt would have been several times greater than the pain he endured.

Gis looked back at Shirone's group with eyes filled with emotion. Then he bowed his head so deeply that his sincerity seemed to overflow.

"Thank you! Thank you so much! I'll never forget this kindness."

Tess patted Gis's shoulder as if it was nothing. Having heard Freeman's story, showing off could wait.

"Hoho! You can forget things like this anytime. As long as you remember what I said when we left. If you're really grateful, you'll have to show it through actions from now on, right?"

"Huh? What do you mean?"

Gis, who didn't understand Tess's words, blinked. Not only Shirone's group but even Yuna was smiling while looking at him.

* * *

After putting the exhausted Yuna to bed and coming out of the room, Gis returned to the table. Sipping herbal tea, he resumed the conversation that had been interrupted.

"So you're saying you'll enter the autonomous district through the Kergo ruins? That's why you need an interpreter."

"Yeah. From what Yuna said, it seems you might be able to do it? I want to know what level you're at."

"Daily conversation should be no problem. I can guide you. Hmm, but entering the native autonomous district..."

Gis made a subtle expression and stroked his chin.

"What's wrong? You don't look good. Is there something bothering you?"

"No, it's fine. I'll guide you anytime. However, I don't know what business you're going for, but that place is special. Not that it's secretive, but it's an area where the Galiant government strictly controls access. Will that still be okay?"
