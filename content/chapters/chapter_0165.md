"Huh? The government is controlling access? But the Galliant government and the native autonomous zone have different administrative agencies. If we insist on going in, there's nothing they can really do about it, right?"

"Of course, that's true. It's only nominal control. But I thought there must be a reason they're going to such lengths to block access. Sorry if I said something unnecessary."

"No, it's fine. We didn't know about it either. But our intention to go hasn't changed. Of course, that's assuming you'll guide us, Gis."

"Naturally! When it comes to guides, who else but Gis?"

Gis confidently struck his chest and then gasped in pain. Only after a considerable time had passed for the pain to subside did he continue speaking.

"But, uh, with my body in this condition, I'm not sure if I can properly move around."

"Don't worry about that. Tomorrow we're going to see a healing mage that Freeman introduced us to. Most external injuries should be treatable there."

"Wow, a healing mage? That must be incredibly expensive to treat?"

When Gis widened his eyes in surprise, Amy looked at him with drowsy eyes and said:

"It'll be cheaper than the guide fee you proposed."

Gis scratched his head. When put that way, he could really feel how much he had been trying to overcharge them.

"Haha, why bring that up all of a sudden? That's all in the past."

Shirone sank into the plush sofa.

"Anyway, it would be good to rest today. Our mental strength will recover after sleeping, but Rian and Tess will be uncomfortable until they receive healing magic."

"Huh? No, I'm fine. My wounds have already healed."

At Tess's words, the entire group turned to look at her. Indeed, the sword cuts that had been on her cheeks and arms were cleanly healed.

"Wow, how did you do that? Is it similar to what Freeman did?"

"Yeah. I set my second Schema to mitochondria."

"Mitochondria?"

"They're cellular organelles that produce energy. Using a mitochondria Schema dramatically increases basic physical abilities like agility, regeneration, and stamina. That's why swordsmen without exceptional talent often choose mitochondria as their basic build. Probably kingdom soldiers and mercenaries use mitochondria builds a lot."

"I see. But what do you mean by second build and basic build?"

Having been beaten by numerous swordsmen in the recent battle with the Parrot Bandits, Shirone wanted to learn more about Schema.

Combat with swordsmen was definitely different from magical combat. Since there was no telling what dangers awaited in the ruins, it was better to collect as much combat-related information as possible.

"A build refers to a technique tree. When people explain Schema, they often tell you to imagine a virtual body, but when you actually learn it, the sensation is different. The cells that make up your body awaken and expand their clarity. So here's the question: how do swordsmen stack multiple builds?"

Amy and Rian knew the answer but didn't respond. Since Tess had the highest understanding of Schema among them, they intended to let her explain.

"Well, if it's a virtual diagram, wouldn't you develop it by dividing it into parts like arms and legs?"

"That's what people usually think. Of course, it's not impossible. But that way, you can't adjust the body's balance. For example, if you keep developing only the nervous system, your muscles will burst. Conversely, if you develop only muscle strength, your fist might shatter when you swing it."

"So there were such problems. I've actually been curious about this for a while. I knew about strengthening the body, but how to maintain balance."

"It's probably similar to magic. You probably have a systematic method for handling the mind too. Special patterns and such."

"Yeah. It's called the Four-Direction Style. There are things like sequence formulas too."

"It's the same for swordsmen. That's what builds are. Think of it as creating multiple virtual diagrams and continuously layering them. For example, it's like this: you lay the mitochondria Schema as the foundation, then lay a muscle enhancement Schema on top of that, then eye techniques on top of that, and so on. Since you build technique trees after completing the base, the risk of physical destruction from balance collapse is drastically reduced."

"Ah! So there was such a method."

"The most efficient is the base Schema. If the Schema laid at the foundation has 100% efficiency, the second layer is 50%, the third layer is 25%. It's drastically reduced this way. You can change the order, but unless you're a master of technique trees, it's hard to apply immediately in real combat. However, there are several exceptions to this, most notably a technique called reversal."

"That's the technique Freeman uses that Amy mentioned, right? How do you do it? Do you create specific patterns like the Four-Direction Style?"

"No, Schema doesn't work that way. To explain it simply, reversal is possible because you can change the perspective from which you experience Schema."

Tess reached out to the table and demonstrated the motion of picking up and moving paper.

"For example, imagine stacking three transparent sheets of paper here. When you look down, your gaze will pass through the papers in order. If we call this 1, 2, 3, then reversal reverses the perspective to view from bottom to top. 3, 2, 1. Like this. Besides this, there are numerous techniques related to technique trees like detachment, penetration, folding, crossing. Building Schema considering all of these is called a build."

Shirone was amazed. He had thought swordsmen simply enhanced physical abilities, but now he saw it was as technical as being a mage.

"I see. So Tess put the mitochondria Schema on her second technique tree. The efficiency is half compared to the first."

"Right. Mitochondria build is popular, but it's somewhat wasteful to focus the body's activity on a position that can utilize 100% Schema efficiency. Unless it's literally a battle of body versus body. Therefore, those who properly practice swordsmanship choose the Schema most suitable for their techniques. In my case, I chose a nervous system build. The most important thing for handling three swords is precision."

Now Shirone understood. If they fought with the same three swords and same Schema abilities, a nervous system build would overwhelm a mitochondria build.

"The reason the mercenaries we met in the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice were decent was that they didn't choose mitochondria builds. The warrior seemed to be muscle enhancement type, and the archer was probably a sensory build."

"Huh? Are nervous system and sensory system different?"

"They're similar but the enhancement areas are different. Simply put, think of it as the difference between internal and external senses. A nervous system build like mine is internal sense. Therefore, I can perform bodily movements more precisely than anyone. Conversely, a sensory build is external sense. It refers to primary senses like eyes, nose, and ears, and proximate senses like tongue and touch. It's natural for archers to learn primary senses. That's why their sight, smell, and hearing are several times more sensitive than others. Of course, I've also adopted sensory system for my third build."

"Ah, so that's why you said it's hard to tail someone when there's an archer."

"Right. Anyway, the important thing is finding a build that suits you. Of course, diligently polishing each Schema is basic. Even if you adopt a mitochondria build, if your training is insufficient, your physical abilities might be inferior to a swordsman who chose mitochondria for their third technique tree."

"Now I understand what Schema is as a concept. Why they call it a human body diagram."

"Ultimately, you can think of it as another self-image. For instance, there's a phenomenon called phantom pain. Even people with severed arms unconsciously feel pain when an object is placed in the space where their arm would pass. That's the reality of Schema."

Listening to the explanation, Amy also felt there was much to learn, just like Shirone. At first, she thought a swordsman's explanation would be easier, so she left the explaining to her, but as the story progressed, content even she didn't know came up.

"Then Tess, how many Schema layers has our father stacked? From my childhood memories, he had incredibly many techniques. If efficiency drops with each layer, wouldn't the fourth layer onward make no difference whether you build up or not?"

"Right. Usually that's the case. But there's a method for that too. A way to make the second technique tree's efficiency 100."

Shirone, already captivated by Schema's appeal, showed interest and asked:

"Oh, really? What kind?"

"Swordsmen call it mastery. As I said earlier, to explain Schema, you should imagine a silhouette with your own appearance drawn. Opening Schema means transparently clearing away the black parts. But honestly, how many people have perfectly grasped their bodies? In other words, people who have peeled away all the black parts in one Schema layer."

"Hmm, that definitely seems difficult."

"Right. It requires tremendous training and genius-level talent. But there are people in the world who have achieved it. Becoming perfectly transparent and eventually fusing with their own body. Therefore, a person who has mastered a specific Schema essentially makes that layer disappear. If someone has mastered five Schema layers, their sixth Schema's efficiency becomes 100. But this is a matter of time and effort. With talent, it could be shortened, but still."

"Wow."

Shirone exhaled the breath he had been holding. Though he had dreamed of being a mage since childhood, during his real sword duel with Rian, he had realized the infinitude of swordsmanship.

Mages and swordsmen. Spirit Zone and Schema. There was indeed a reason they were called the two forces that divided this world.

"Really amazing, Tess."

At Shirone's heartfelt praise, Tess blushed.

"Oh, this is nothing much. I've been learning since I was young, so I know this stuff. Actually, I explained it a bit lengthily hoping it would help you as a mage."

"Yeah. It really helped a lot. Now if a situation like today comes up, I think I can respond better than before. So Tess has already recovered, and tomorrow only Gis and Rian need to receive healing magic."

Though Shirone spoke casually, Tess suddenly realized something and her face hardened.

Come to think of it, even during the discussion about swordsmen and Schema, Rian hadn't interjected a single word.

Tess slyly glanced at Rian. He was listening with his usual stoic expression, but his gaze was fixed on his own body.

His body was literally a complete mess.

Though he had overwhelmed Falcoa with imaginary Schema at the end, his weakness of not mastering Schema was still significant.

Even now, far from recovering, he felt like his wounds were getting worse.

'Damn it! Why am I...'

Tess looked at Rian with pity, but her heart also raced with tension. She felt hurt, as if she had unintentionally wounded Rian.

'His pride must be hurt. You're probably the most upset person here.'

Realizing his friends were looking at him, Rian hastily fixed his expression. As if nothing had happened, he smiled brightly and pounded his chest.

"Haha! I'm fine. Even without healing magic or anything. I'm tough."

Indeed, even though Rian was pounding his body with tremendous force, he showed no sign of pain, not even a change in expression.

But everyone knew. He was enduring it with nothing but superhuman patience.

Of course, that mental strength itself was wondrous, but if his wounds weren't treated, his combat ability would drop significantly.

Still, no one urged Rian again to receive healing magic. They understood the misery of having to show weakness unavoidably.

But Shirone was different. During this journey, Rian had seriously performed his duty as a guardian knight. If Rian was serious, Shirone thought he should treat him with the same resolve.
