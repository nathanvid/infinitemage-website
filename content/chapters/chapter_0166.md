"Rian, don't be stubborn and get healing magic tomorrow."

"I'm telling you I'm fine! I didn't sustain any fatal injuries. Though the part where Tess stabbed me does hurt strangely. Hahaha!"

"Rian, the moment you collapse is the moment I die."

Rian's laughter stopped abruptly. The living room was enveloped in silence. Everyone looked back and forth between Shirone and Rian with tense expressions.

"Shirone, I..."

"I know. You'll protect me until you die. But a split-second decision can determine the success or failure of a mission. I'd prefer if you took more sword blows for me. If you're going to be stubborn like this, I'll have to reconsider entrusting my back to you."

At first glance, it might sound selfish and cold. No, asking a friend to take sword blows was certainly ruthless.

But Shirone knew Rian better than anyone.

Rian was fire. The way to fuel that fire wasn't shallow praise, but engraving the harsh reality as it was.

Rian's lips slowly curved upward. He felt as if hot flames were surging inside him, burning away all miscellaneous emotions.

"Don't worry, Shirone! I'll do whatever it takes to return this body to perfect condition! As long as I'm protecting you, no one will be able to touch you."

Rian seemed ready to receive healing magic right away. Thanks to this, Tess, who was liberated from hell, secretly looked up at the ceiling and sighed.

'Phew. Thank you, Shirone. Really, thank you.'

Tess had no doubt that Rian would someday become the greatest swordsman. But he also knew that even if he became a burning sword, the only person who could wield that sword would be Shirone.

Early in the morning, Shirone's party left the villa.

There was a mage guild in the area where residents lived. Due to the Freeman organization's control of the island, its influence wasn't great, but it had no trouble maintaining itself thanks to having a healing mage.

Due to the nature of the resort, injuries were common when people let their guard down while playing.

Commoners sought folk remedies or physicians, but nobles received treatment from healing mages even if they injured just a finger.

Prices were set from 1 to 10 gold depending on the type and severity of the wound, and thanks to Freeman's influence, treatment proceeded at reasonable prices.

Healing magic promotes cellular activity to naturally heal wounds. This was different from physicians who identified the cause of illness and found appropriate treatment methods.

Among Schema users, there was a profession called Surgery that performed emergency operations, but mages rejected artificial methods and preferred to follow nature's course.

While theory became complex at higher magic levels, simply activating cells was remarkably effective. The human body knew how to heal itself.

The healing mage's skills didn't seem particularly outstanding. Since Gis and Rian's wounds weren't light either, it took 2 hours for all treatment to finish.

Seeing Rian's cleanly healed wounds, Shirone was newly impressed by magic's power.

Of course, 2 hours would be impractical for use on a battlefield where combat unfolded in real-time. But in the long term, the difference in combat power between having a healing mage in the group versus not having one would be tremendous.

Returning to the villa, Shirone's party reorganized their luggage and stepped outside again.

While healing magic only regenerated wounds and couldn't improve overall condition, Rian was naturally strong-boned and seemed overflowing with vitality.

Gis also seemed confident in his endurance, showing no signs of fatigue as he cheerfully shouldered his backpack.

Rian looked at Gis's bag with curiosity. Since Gis, in his role as guide, was scheduled to part ways once they entered the autonomous zone, he didn't particularly need equipment.

"Huh? What's that luggage?"

"Ah, this is lunch. Yuna made it while we were getting treatment. She's actually amazing at cooking. She works at a restaurant, you know."

"Oh, she was a professional? Perfect. Let's eat now."

As Rian approached drooling, Tess pinched his side and scolded him.

"You just ate, what more food do you want? Let's go to the ruins first. It'll be troublesome if it gets dark."

Since they'd already been to the location once, everyone knew it was better to leave quickly. Perhaps because of this, even the girls finished preparations earlier than usual without complaining.

When they arrived 1 kilometer from the ruins, the coachman stopped his horse without fail. Shirone's party was now accustomed to this, so they got off the carriage and walked to the ruins.

Nothing had changed from when they came before.

The bustling crowds, natives guarding the surroundings with expressionless faces, even the tavern where they'd met the mercenaries remained the same.

Heading toward the outskirts of the ruins, they decided to have lunch in the park. The lunch Yuna had packed was rice balls made by chopping leftover ingredients and soaking rice. Though it was unfamiliar food, it was apparently quite popular on the island.

When Shirone tried it, the taste was indeed different. Various ingredients harmonized to create a salty and savory flavor.

He'd worried the portions might be small, but once it entered his stomach, it had a more substantial taste than bread, which was nice.

Gis examined the manual written on the note Freeman had given him. Though it was brief information, having worked in the organization for several years, he quickly understood how the deal would proceed.

The place he led them to was on the opposite side of the entrance to the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice. There too, a native wearing civilized clothing stood guard.

"Hello."

"Who are you?"

"We're from the Freeman organization. When can we depart?"

The native looked Gis up and down. But when he showed his pass, the native immediately shared what he knew.

After exchanging a few words in the native language, Gis turned to Shirone and said:

"He says we need to wait for transportation to arrive. About an hour?"

"Huh? Transportation?"

"We'll probably have to take a mine cart. That's what was written. Anyway, he says to come back when the cart arrives."

Tess looked around at everyone and asked:

"What should we do? Wait here for about an hour? Or look around a bit more?"

Shirone fell into thought. Was it really okay to enter the autonomous zone like this? If so, why did the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice exist?

As Tess said, it might be tradition, but he thought the probability of that was low. Most importantly, that place was touched by the Labyrinth's Breath.

"I want to try challenging the test gateway once more."

When Shirone suddenly brought this up, his friends looked at him unexpectedly. They wondered if there was any need to go through such hardship when they could comfortably go to the autonomous zone.

But Amy's thoughts were similar to Shirone's. Something that people shouldn't know definitely existed underground in the ruins. Therefore, even if two routes led to the same place, there must be a special reason for having two paths.

The problem was that they couldn't pass the test. If they were greedy about impossible tasks, they'd just waste time.

"Can we really pass? Are you thinking of testing it with lasers?"

"Yes. I'd like to try if possible."

"What if that doesn't work either? The mine cart might not wait for us. It'll take quite a while if you enter the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice, won't it?"

"Actually, even if I fail, it probably won't matter much."

When Shirone spoke nonchalantly, Amy asked with a puzzled expression:

"It won't matter if you fail?"

"There's something that's been bothering me. Of course, I can't be certain about anything yet. So how about this? I'll enter the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice. The rest of you wait here and take the mine cart. That way we can match the timing and experience both routes."

Amy thought Shirone's words were reasonable. Since Shirone was the person who received the highest score in the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice, there was no need for others to follow him in. Most importantly, if he took the test alone, it wouldn't consume much time.

"Alright. Then let's head to the test route first."

With Amy's agreement, the party headed to the eastern altar. A different person from the native who had guarded it when they entered with the mercenaries before was standing watch.

"Shirone, you remember the password, right?"

"Yes. You all stay back. Remember how you were mistaken for party members just by being nearby before. This time I'll go in alone and come back."

"Right. There shouldn't be any problems, but... be careful anyway."

Shirone walked toward the altar. But before he could take three steps, he stopped in place.

The sound of someone pounding on the door from inside the altar could be heard, indicating someone had entered first.

The native who had been watching Shirone approach the altar turned around when the door pounding began. He then operated the mechanism to open the stone wall.

'Someone else must have taken the challenge. Are there more challengers than I thought?'

Shirone was curious about who was taking the test and coming out, so he watched the altar with excitement. But the moment he confirmed their faces, he was shocked beyond belief.

"Huh, what?"

Amy, standing behind Shirone, also flinched and shouted in surprise:

"What! How are they here?"

"What's wrong, Amy? Do you know them? Are they friends?"

"Ha! Friends? They're enemies!"

Judging by Amy's reaction, they didn't seem to have a good relationship. Rian and Tess, now even more curious, carefully observed the man and woman who emerged from the altar.

From a distance, they seemed similar enough to be siblings. Black hair and black pupils, with a dark feeling that contrasted with their pale faces, creating a unique atmosphere.

Shirone stared at them blankly. They were Canis and Arin, Arcane's disciples.

'Why are they here?'

Of course, they were free to wander wherever they wanted. But it wasn't a common tourist destination, and the fact that they emerged from a place with the Labyrinth's spacetime was ominous.

Canis and Arin were equally surprised to discover Shirone's party. But they seemed to have expected it to some degree, as they quickly regained their composure.

"So you're here too, as expected."

Canis approached with a mocking expression. Meanwhile, Arin was shyly looking down. Having been confined in Radum her entire life, she wasn't accustomed to social interactions.

Though they had fought before, they would be classmates from next semester, so she felt she should somehow offer a greeting.

"Um, hello, Shirone?"

Arin mustered all her courage and raised her hand to Shirone. Then Canis glared at Arin with fiercely narrowed eyes. Realizing her mistake, Arin quickly lowered her hand, but unexpectedly, Shirone welcomed her warmly.

"Yeah, hello. Have you been well?"

"Huh? Yes. Just, well..."

Arin answered in a shrinking voice while watching Canis's reaction. But she wondered if there was really a need to be so hostile when the other person was genuinely welcoming her.

With such thoughts, she slowly raised her head, and the moment Arin encountered Shirone's insight, she was startled and left her mouth hanging open.

'He was impressive then too, but now it's even clearer. What a truly remarkable person.'

Meanwhile, Shirone also found himself deep in thought at Canis and Arin's appearance. Anyway, the fact that they had returned from the altar meant that the Angel's Eyes had ultimately given them a failing grade.

'It really isn't easy. The Labyrinth's spacetime.'

As the Great Mage's disciples, Canis and Arin were strong. Most importantly, he thought they were superior to anyone at the magic school in terms of real combat experience.

Of course, Shirone had subdued him in their previous encounter, but it was certain that he had struggled against him even while receiving attribute benefits.

But even such opponents had been unable to advance further in the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice and had returned. He could guess how high the Labyrinth's cut-off line was set.
