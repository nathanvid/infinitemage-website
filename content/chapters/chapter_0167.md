Amy walked toward them. Probably thinking the same thing as Shirone, she covered her mouth and teased Canis.

"Ho ho ho! Don't tell me you failed? Well, I suppose that's just like you two."

While Shirone might not harbor any resentment since he won the battle, Amy had suffered plenty at the hands of these two.

Following her philosophy of always paying back what she received, she took this opportunity to deliver a proper blow.

But Canis didn't fall for her provocation.

"Hmph, aren't you two in the same boat? Now that I look at you, even the graduating class isn't much."

"How ridiculous! How do you know I failed?"

"The fact that you know I failed means you also took the test. If you had succeeded, you wouldn't be wandering around in this place right now. Are you an idiot by any chance?"

"You bastard! Where does a greenhorn junior get off being so cocky!"

"Who was the one helplessly dragged around by that junior? Besides, shouldn't you be grateful? If I hadn't stopped Lucas, you might have died."

Murderous intent flashed in Amy's eyes. The memory of nearly being humiliated by Lucas when she was exposed to Abyss Nova came flooding back, filling her with rage.

"You bastard...!"

Before Shirone could intervene, Amy raised her fist toward Canis.

Just as she was about to strike his face with the power of her Schema, the shadow cast behind Canis surged upward, and jet-black claws came over his shoulders.

Amy reflexively stepped back. Harvest, who was protecting Canis as if embracing him, grinned with a torn mouth.

"Kekeke! Long time no see, big sister. Your personality hasn't changed."

"Kyaaa! What is that thing!"

The tourists screamed and fled at the sight of Harvest. From Shirone's perspective, this was completely understandable.

While magical effects weren't unfamiliar to nobles, a human-shaped shadow suddenly standing up was an entirely different level of grotesquery.

Even Tess was stunned at the sight of Harvest.

"My goodness. The shadow is talking? Rian, have you ever seen anything like that?"

A small face contrasted with broad shoulders, and a panther-like slender waist. Though it had a human form, its arms were twice as thin and long as a human's. Its palms were as large as shields, and its claws were sharp as swords.

"No, this is my first time too. But Shirone seems familiar with it."

Harvest was spreading its palm wide to defend most of Canis's torso. Even Amy had to be cautious in front of Harvest, which specialized in shock absorption.

"Keke, let's both be careful about approaching. I don't want to see blood in a place like this."

"That thing..."

Just as Amy was about to charge again, Shirone raised his finger. A red photon compressed at his fingertip, trembling with afterimages as if it would fire at any moment.

This time it was Harvest who fell silent. It was the laser technique that had blown him up before.

"Apologize to Amy. It's wrong to pick at other people's wounds."

"Wounds? You call something that trivial a wound? Besides, I'm the one who saved that woman. Nobles' way of thinking, really."

"That's for the person who was hurt to decide. If you brought up someone's painful memories, you should at least be able to apologize. How long are you going to keep looking at the world sideways?"

"Hmph! I don't want to hear that from a hothouse flower."

Following Canis's provocation, Harvest massively inflated its upper body, threatening everyone. Simultaneously, Shirone's laser glowed even more intensely.

Arin transformed her Spirit Zone into tentacle form and slowly sent it toward Shirone. Thinking this was dangerous, she planned to disrupt the laser with mental interference.

But before the zone could reach him, Amy stepped in front of Shirone. Arin frowned as if troubled. Most mental magic was useless against the power of the crimson eyes.

Magical creatures, lasers, mental magic, magnetic memory.

Magics of different natures were biting and being bitten, circling like a belt. No one could move rashly, and each was watching the others carefully.

In the tension that suggested something could happen at any moment, Tess grabbed Rian's arm and pretended to cry.

"What's with them? They're scary."

Rian's thoughts differed from Tess's. People call magicians bizarre. Ultimately, the more one deviates from common sense, the stronger one's identity as a magician becomes.

Rian was pleased that Shirone had become such a bizarre and abnormal person.

"You're doing well, Shirone."

"What, what?"

Tess asked back with a bewildered expression. It was the look one gives a pervert.

But without answering, Rian walked toward the magicians. He drew the straight sword from his back and said.

"Hey, I don't know who you are, but...!"

Tess, who had run from far away, climbed onto Rian's back and covered his lips with her palm.

"Please have some sense. What if you do that too?"

"Mmph! Let go! Shirone! Mmph!"

Shirone and Amy, Canis and Tess watched Rian and Tess's struggle with bewilderment.

Thanks to this, the tension of battle relaxed considerably, and Harvest also deflated its inflated upper body.

As the laser's light weakened, Arin's Spirit Zone dissipated. Amy's crimson eyes returned to their original color.

Actually, there was no real need to fight with blood boiling. If Amy had gotten under Canis's skin, Canis had simply added one more emotion to counter her.

"Let's stop this pointless war of attrition. We didn't come all the way here to fight with you."

Canis said as he absorbed Harvest back into his shadow.

When the other side proposed a ceasefire first, Amy also relaxed her fighting spirit and regained her reason.

As the tension dissipated, Canis asked the question he'd been curious about since first seeing Shirone here.

"By the way, how is it? Since you're still staying here despite failing, does that mean you found a way to enter the Kergo autonomous zone?"

Shirone was about to say something, but before his voice could come out, Amy interrupted.

"Why should we tell you that?"

This time it wasn't picking a fight. In a sense, it was information obtained by risking their lives, so it wasn't something to carelessly reveal to untrustworthy people.

"No need to be so wary. We know how to enter the autonomous zone too. You're probably thinking of taking the Loop smuggling route, right?"

Though she didn't show it, Amy was greatly surprised. Canis seemed to know about the channel where the Freeman organization traded Loops. Then why had they bothered to enter the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice to take the test?

Canis, who had been staring intently at Amy lost in thought, raised the corners of his mouth.

"I can hear your brain working from here. If you're curious, shall I tell you?"

"Hmph! Who's curious? I know that much!"

"Ah, really? Arin, what do you think?"

Canis turned his head to ask. Arin, who had been lost in other thoughts for a moment, hurriedly came to her senses and answered.

"Huh? Ah, that's a lie. She's really curious. She's going pitter-patter."

"Grr...!"

Amy ground her teeth with a frustrated expression. She didn't know what "pitter-patter" meant, but hiding emotions from Arin, who had insight abilities, was impossible.

At that moment, a rumbling sound came from Arin's stomach.

The gazes of Shirone's group focused on Arin. Her face turned red as a persimmon as she lowered her head in embarrassment.

Canis looked at Arin with a worried expression he'd never shown anyone before.

"Arin, are you okay?"

"I'm fine. This is nothing. It was nothing before, right?"

Canis gritted his teeth. They had traveled for a long time since leaving magic school, and their travel money had run out, leaving them without anything to eat for three days already.

He could starve as long as necessary, but Arin was different. The instinct to protect her that he'd maintained in Radum for ten years still remained.

Canis swallowed his pride and spoke to Shirone.

"Do you guys... have any food? Arin hasn't eaten. I'm fine, so could you do something?"

Only then did Shirone examine Canis's appearance. His clothes were shabby from who knows how long of travel, and there were dirt marks as if he'd slept in the mountains.

'He said all the inheritance Arcane left was taken away...'

Since the mental pulse test, Canis hadn't come to school. Come to think of it, for those with no connections, finding food would be the biggest problem.

While they had sufficient skills, magicians without credentials had trouble finding work because clients were reluctant to hire them. Of course, there were those who wanted them, but most were involved in criminal activities.

But Canis no longer wanted to live trapped in darkness. He had realized that by fighting society, one could never rise to high places.

Amy sighed and spoke.

"First, we need to eat something. There's a tavern we went to before, so let's go. Their noodles are delicious."

"No! I'm really fine!"

Arin waved her hands. She was actually starving to death, but thinking of Canis's pride, she couldn't bear to follow.

Amy grabbed Arin's wrist and forcibly dragged her along.

"Fine, my foot? There's thunder in your stomach. You need stamina whether you fight or not. Canis, you come too."

"I'm fine. Just take Arin."

"Quiet, come when I tell you to come. It's natural for a senior to buy junior classmates a meal when they're hungry."

Shirone pushed Canis's back.

"That's right, Canis. Let's go in first. I have things to talk to you about anyway."

Canis reluctantly followed, and Amy led them to the tavern where they'd met the mercenaries.

When the six people took their seats, Shirone introduced Canis and Arin to Rian. Rian was a bit surprised to hear they were disciples of a Great Magician, but was inwardly relieved by Amy's kind explanation that they had lost to Shirone.

First, filling their stomachs was urgent. Canis and Arin must have been truly hungry, as they hurriedly devoured two bowls of noodles each.

Shirone's group, who had eaten Yuna's lunch box a little while ago, felt full just watching them eat.

Seeing them drink even the broth clean, Shirone couldn't help but smile. Regardless of their origins or personalities, he thought they too were the same humans.

When the two who had filled their stomachs finally looked like they might live and smacked their lips, Shirone casually broached the subject.

"Both we and you must have complicated thoughts, but let's talk somewhat openly. Why did you come here?"

"Canis has always been interested in ruins. So we're in the middle of exploring ruins."

"Ah, was Canis's dream to be an archaeologist?"

"Tch, unnecessary talk..."

Canis, who hated telling others about himself, muttered sullenly. But he didn't tell Arin to stop.

Though lacking in social skills, Arin wasn't simple enough to readily answer just because someone asked. It was the best answer that could reveal facts while hiding necessary information.

Actually, the two had entered the island not for ruin exploration but for a special reason. And to get what they wanted, they absolutely needed Shirone.

"Let us ask too. Why did you come?"

Canis pointed at Amy as he asked. The leader of the four would be Shirone anyway, but he didn't want to show that he had something he wanted from him.

But Amy was no ordinary person when it came to psychological warfare. She knew enough methods to hide facts while avoiding Arin's insight.

"Huhu. Of course we came to go to the Kergo autonomous zone. Just like you."

"Hmph, do you know what's there?"

"Hmm, you talk as if you know?"

"Could be, could not be."

Amy smiled with artificial eyes. But inside, she was frustrated enough to go crazy.

'He knows. He definitely knows, this bastard.'

Canis had chosen the test route instead of the Loop smuggling route. That meant he at least clearly understood the reason he had to choose that place.

'This is troublesome. How do I extract information from these guys?'

Canis and Arin were different from the mercenaries they'd met before. Moreover, with insight present, they had to consider themselves no match in psychological warfare.

Shirone, who had only been listening until now, asked directly.

"Canis, can't you tell us what you know? Actually, we don't know much."

Amy knew what Shirone was thinking, but ultimately they were clearly at a disadvantage. In that case, it was better to open their hearts honestly and expect a reaction.

Contrary to expectations, Canis accepted it matter-of-factly. Though Shirone's group absolutely shouldn't notice, actually Canis and Arin were in a situation where they absolutely needed Shirone's help.

"Fine. But first, there's something I need to confirm."

"Ask anything. If I know it, I'll answer."

"The reason you want to go to the autonomous zone. Is it because you want to know about the Labyrinth of Time and Space?"

Shirone's eyes widened greatly. The Labyrinth of Time and Space was something only his close friends and the headmaster knew about.

"How did you know? Do you know about the labyrinth? No, how much do you know about the Kergo Ruins?"

When Shirone asked urgently, Canis rather leisurely propped his chin.

"Well. I'd say I know at least more than you."

Shirone was lost in serious thought. Where on earth had they obtained the information? And in less than a month at that.

Then he suddenly realized. The shadow cast at Canis's feet. And the existence of the magical creature residing there explained everything.

"It's Arcane's knowledge."
