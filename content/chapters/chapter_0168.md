"Ah..."

Hearing Shirone's words, Amy also realized it. How could they not have thought of this? Harvest was a magical creature that inherited all of Arcane's memories.

The great magician Viltor Arcane, who once ruled the world.

That person might know secrets about the Kergo Ruins that others didn't.

Shirone and Amy looked at Canis with conviction in their eyes. However, Canis's attitude remained noncommittal.

"Hmm, if I had to say what I think, you're half right and half wrong."

"Half and half? What does that mean?"

Canis held back his words. It was still too early. The secrets surrounding the Kergo ruins were a much more serious matter than Shirone realized.

Amy leaned forward and said, "Are you going to keep acting like this? If you're going to tell us anyway, just say it now."

"I don't understand. Why should I have to? You're not going to complain about meal expenses, are you?"

"Of course that's included. But for other reasons too, you'll have no choice but to spill it. You need us. Otherwise, there'd be no point in even trying to negotiate like this, right?"

Canis closed his mouth and let out a long breath. Of course, he had expected this to happen. It was just a matter of timing.

"Fine. To be honest, I want something from you too. In that sense, we both have what the other needs."

"What do you want from us? Are you talking about the travel permit?"

"That kind of thing can be solved easily. Using mental magic, I just need to hand over a piece of paper. Arin's telepathic abilities can even control the realm of language."

"Ah, there was that method too."

Shirone realized why the two had been able to enter the altar without even an interpreter.

"The reason we didn't choose that route anyway is because someone must pass through the test's gateway. But as you know, we failed, so we want to borrow your help. In that sense, I want to negotiate with you."

Amy analyzed Canis's words. Then suddenly, her suspicion branched off in an unexpected direction.

"By the way, what score did you get?"

Canis blinked at the unexpected question. Then he subtly averted his gaze and avoided answering.

"I don't want to say."

"Oh my, why? How much did you get? Huh?"

"Why should I tell you? If you're so curious, why don't you tell me yours first?"

"No, you tell me first. Then I'll tell you mine."

"No. You first."

Shirone gave up listening and intervened. At this rate, they'd repeat the same words all night long.

"Enough. Let's continue with what we were discussing."

Perhaps both their legs were shaking, as Amy and Canis quickly shut their mouths.

Once the situation settled, Canis continued with more haggard eyes than before.

"Anyway, what I want to propose is this. The test route. If you pass through the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice, then let's talk again."

Amy frowned and said, "That's kind of strange, isn't it?"

"What's strange about it?"

"Aren't you doing this because you couldn't pass either? If Shirone passes, there's no need to take you along. You need to have something to give us for a deal to work."

"That might be the case right now. But trust me. This absolutely won't be a losing deal for you."

"Then prove it. Even if you don't reveal the core, you should be able to prove it to some degree. Otherwise, this deal is void. We can't be used by you without knowing the purpose."

Canis looked back at Arin with conflicted eyes. This wasn't something he could decide on his own.

Finally, when Arin gave her consent, he opened his mouth reluctantly.

"Fine. Then I'll tell you this. You said you were going to the autonomous zone to learn about the labyrinth, right? Do you absolutely have to go, no matter what method you use?"

"Yes. We want to know about the labyrinth in detail."

"Then... maybe the information I have could save your lives."

Feeling the silence, Shirone's heart pounded. Save their lives? It was incomprehensible. What could be in the autonomous zone to warrant such talk?

"I'm telling you clearly, if you approach the Labyrinth of Time and Space without my information, you'll die with close to 100% certainty. But if you join hands with me, you might survive. In short, I'm making a deal with your lives as collateral."

"That...!"

Amy jumped up and shouted.

"Do you think such threats will work? This isn't proof. You're just trying to scare us. The Freeman organization has been coming and going there too. No matter how dangerous it is, it's not a matter of life and death."

"That's why I said it. There's no particular danger in the autonomous zone. The problem is when entering through the test route. And Shirone."

Canis turned to look at Shirone.

"I already know the method you're planning to try in the Room of Sacrifice and Achievement. You're thinking of opening Immortal Function in the Labyrinth of Time and Space, aren't you?"

All eyes focused on Shirone. Receiving everyone's attention, Shirone remained silent for a while before finally speaking up.

"That's right. When I first saw the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice, the structure itself was unique. I thought there was no need to rotate the Labyrinth of Time and Space in eight directions just to test a warrior's power. The atmosphere there was too serious to be mere decoration. So I wondered. I thought maybe what the angel's eyes are watching isn't something like military force."

Canis nodded as if it was the right judgment and said, "For now, we can only hope that method is correct."

"Huh? Don't you know?"

"I told you, it's half and half. But I also suspect it might be related to Immortal Function. Of course, I could be wrong."

"Then Canis, what do you want?"

"Let's discuss that after you pass the test gateway. I've revealed this much only because you're an Unlocker. I've provided quite a lot of information believing in a slim possibility."

"Hmm, what should we do?"

Amy, who made eye contact with Shirone, nodded. Anyway, since they had decided to challenge the test gateway before meeting Canis, making a deal wouldn't be a loss.

Amy gave instructions as if summarizing the situation.

"Alright. Then Shirone, go into the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice. We'll go to the autonomous zone first using the travel permit. There's no problem up to this point, right?"

Amy asked for confirmation once more. It was proof of how powerful the card Canis had played was.

"No problem. The smuggling route is just a convenient way to go anyway. Only one person needs to receive a passing grade in the Labyrinth of Time and Space."

Amy's head throbbed. She could roughly picture the situation, but everything was blurry due to lack of information.

"Phew, I have no idea what's what. Anyway, we'll know if Shirone passes. Let's get going then. If we walk now, we can make it on time."

The group that left the tavern split into two factions. Amy's group merged with Canis's group, and Shirone was scheduled to head to the altar alone.

"Well then, Shirone, do well and come back. Don't push yourself too hard."

Amy was worried. Hadn't he previously pushed himself too hard opening Immortal Function and nearly departed to a place from which he could never return?

"Yeah. I won't push myself. If I try and it doesn't work, I'll just give up. Amy, be careful too. Unexpected things might happen."

Since the talk had even touched on matters of life and death, it was inevitable to feel concerned. Amy turned her head to check the party's spectrum. Rian with his strong physical strength, the agile Tess, plus Canis specialized in defense and Arin of the mental type had joined.

The two people who seemed hateful to death when they were enemies were magicians who could certainly pull their weight in a crisis situation. Thinking this way, she felt somewhat reassured.

"We'll probably... not have much to worry about."

"Haha! That's true. It's fortunate that our forces have been reinforced."

Amy couldn't laugh it off. Shirone also seemed to sense that this would be much more dangerous than expected.

As Shirone left for the altar, Amy also led her friends and turned west.

"Arin, let's go too."

As Amy's group created distance, Canis looked at Arin and spoke. However, she seemed to have discovered something curious and couldn't take her eyes off Shirone.

"Arin? What's wrong?"

"Say, Canis... Is Shirone blonde by any chance?"

Arin's mechanism for perceiving things was different from ordinary humans. Since she couldn't combine the form and name of specific objects, she couldn't even distinguish what the real form was.

Therefore, recognizing the blonde Shirone as blonde was definitely an unusual situation.

"Shirone? Yeah, he's blonde. Why? How do you see him?"

Arin blinked and then turned around.

"No, it's nothing strange. Let's go."

Canis shrugged and followed Amy. Arin also started walking and fell into silent thought. At some moment, as if suddenly realizing something, she turned back.

'Ah, I see. That child is...'

Arin couldn't take her eyes off Shirone for quite a while.

* * *

Shirone arrived at the western altar. He approached the native who was glaring with terrifying eyes and spoke the password.

"Kertia, ro hoima. Acrasia, widmia benzen."

The native who nodded operated the mechanism to open the door. When he pushed his body into the pitch-black entrance, a spiral staircase lit by torches appeared.

Shirone slowly descended the stairs. Though he had been here before, the atmosphere was completely different since he was alone.

After descending the stairs, the familiar passage appeared. The natives said something and guided Shirone.

Though he couldn't understand the words, he could guess the content from context. Since it was just protocol for ceremony, there was no need for further communication.

Crossing the iron gate installed at the end of the passage, familiar scenery appeared. Eight spheres floating octagonally on the flat altar. The Labyrinth of Time and Space, called the angel's pupils, was waiting for Shirone.

The gatekeeper had changed, but the man with white tattoos on his face was the same person as before. Or perhaps not. He still couldn't distinguish Kergo faces accurately.

"May I take the test?"

"This is the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice. The angel's eight pupils will judge you. To enter Kergo, you must pass through the Labyrinth of Time and Space."

Waiting for the man's explanation to end, Shirone climbed onto the altar. Before testing Immortal Function, he planned to try attacking the Labyrinth of Time and Space with laser.

Shirone decided to give it his all and concentrated laser in front of his eyes. As it emitted an eerie red light, even the stoic man with white tattoos showed a surprised expression.

Shirone fired the laser with all his might. Numbers appeared on the Labyrinth of Time and Space later than usual. It was probably because impacts were continuously coming in.

Finally, numbers appeared on the Labyrinth of Time and Space. The first number Shirone confirmed was only 200. Then the numbers changed by the second, finally increasing in digits.

From 400 to 782. From 1,311 to 2,643. Eventually it soared past 4,874 to reach 6,822.

Discovering hope, Shirone clenched his fist. But at that moment, the numbers reset and began climbing again from 72.

It seemed the Labyrinth of Time and Space itself had a time limit. After the counting cycle went around twice, the maximum score of 6,822 finally appeared.

The Labyrinth of Time and Space emitted red light and announced Shirone's failure throughout the room.

"Phew."

Shirone exhaled as if deflated. The laser had definitely been effective. But the labyrinth had clearly anticipated even tricks involving energy accumulation and placed restrictions.

The most frustrating thing was that despite recording his personal best score, he still didn't receive a passing grade.

Shirone suddenly remembered Canis's words about possibly losing their lives. Just how far had the headmaster anticipated when he permitted the ruins exploration?

While lost in such thoughts, the man with white tattoos spoke in a solemn voice.

"Will you leave, or will you stay? If you wish to prove your ability, pass through the Labyrinth of Time and Space."

Shirone shook his head as if trying to shake off his fear. He couldn't give up after coming this far. Hadn't his friends already entered the autonomous zone?

"Let me try once more."

The man waited silently with his arms crossed. Thinking permission was granted, Shirone positioned himself in the center of the altar.

Immortal Function.

If this method didn't work, he couldn't push any further. Whatever Canis knew, he planned to give up cleanly.

"Phew."

Shirone calmed his mind and entered his Spirit Zone. As the defensive zone expanded, it swallowed the Labyrinth of Time and Space floating in eight directions.

After checking the Spirit Zone's perimeter one last time, Shirone raised his eyes and opened Immortal Function.

"Gasp!"

At that moment, something unbelievable happened.

Mental power flowed in at an uncontrollable rate and was all being sucked into the Labyrinth of Time and Space.

'This, this is...!'

The speed of mental power absorption was tremendous. In a normal state, the zone would have shrunk instantly. But as much as was being absorbed, power was rushing in from the infinite realm, maintaining a precarious balance.

Shirone was afraid of the current uncontrollable situation. It felt as if his own value had completely disappeared and he had become merely a door connecting the power of one side to the other.

'No! I need to pull myself together!'

In this state, his consciousness would be broken down just like before. The luck of being reassembled by the labyrinth's will wouldn't come again.

"Urrrrgh!"

Shirone restructured his defensive frame to maximum and pulled his zone tight. He felt a taut tension, but the shape remained the same due to the powerful mental discharge.

From there he entered Geumgangbulgoe again and desperately held on.

He couldn't think of anything. He just prayed for it to end quickly and hoped not to scatter away like this.

At that moment, all eight Labyrinth of Time and Space spheres shone brilliantly. Eight streams of light shot toward Shirone simultaneously, then expanded into a white sphere centered on him, completely covering the altar.

"Gaaaasp!"

Shirone shuddered at the intense sense of deprivation. It felt similar to when he first opened Immortal Function.

"Oh, oooooh!"

The natives looked at Shirone wrapped in light and cried out in surprised voices.

Shirone's body was floating up to the ceiling.

As if unfolding some fantasy, his eyelids didn't blink and his pupils shook with shock at whatever he was seeing.

The Labyrinth of Time and Space, having absorbed near-infinite mental power, was using that mental power to transmit information to Shirone.

It was undoubtedly something that could only be shown when the eight spheres contained power to their limit.

The natives shouted at the top of their lungs.

"Ra! Anke! Ra!"

At that moment, light bright enough to blind exploded and completely filled the room with the altar.

The natives turned their heads and squeezed their eyes shut.

And when the light disappeared again, Shirone was already standing on the altar, breathing heavily.

"Gasp! Huff!"

Shirone still couldn't collect himself. He couldn't even distinguish where this place was.

What had he seen? Was it really an existing place? What thoughts had led the labyrinth to create such a device and wait for an Unlocker?

'Is it fantasy? Or is it real? I don't understand anything. What does this have to do with Immortal Function?'

Shirone suddenly emerged from his thoughts and turned his head. All the natives who had gathered at the altar were kneeling on one knee with their heads bowed.

"Why, why are you all doing this?"

Shirone tried to stop them with a bewildered voice. But the natives weren't even breathing, maintaining only postures of submission.

The man with white tattoos looked up at Shirone and said, "Convey the will of Ra, messenger of god."
