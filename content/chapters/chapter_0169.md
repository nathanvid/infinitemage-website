After sending Shirone to the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice, Amy's group arrived at the eastern altar.

When Gis showed the transit pass, the native opened the stone gate.

Gis translated that the mine cart had arrived.

Amy's group nodded, but Canis and Arin seemed uninterested.

This was because Arin had understood the native's words through telepathy, one of her mental resonance abilities.

The underground wasn't very deep due to operating the mine cart.

Rails were installed along soil covered with volcanic ash, and a native who had been waiting with the mine cart greeted them while chewing gum.

His expression was gentle, but Kergo's characteristic intense gaze remained. It felt alien, as if someone else's eyes had been transplanted.

Gis felt the same eerie sensation. However, like a professional guide, he approached with a smiling face.

When he extended his hand for a handshake, the native accepted it.

"The Loop contact person has changed. I'm Gis, the new liaison."

"Gis? You don't look like someone who'd do this kind of work."

The Kergo native assessed his temperament at a glance. Loop smuggling was a serious crime that could result in the death penalty depending on circumstances. In contrast, Gis seemed too mild for a contact person.

"Where's Falcoa? He always came personally to collect them."

"Ah, that person is dead."

"Dead? Deceased?"

When Gis made a throat-slitting gesture with his hand, the native nodded.

The native looked incredulous. Falcoa was strong. He was also a man who shared similarities with Kergo's nature. The fact that Gis had come as a replacement contact person raised suspicions.

"You have the transit pass, right?"

"Of course. Here, look at this."

The native's smile disappeared as he snatched the transit pass.

Amy's group grew tense. They had thought having the pass would be enough, but the wariness was more severe than expected.

Moreover, they weren't here to buy Loop.

Falcoa was dead, and there would be no more Loop transactions. If the native discovered this fact, the consequences were obvious.

The transit pass was genuine.

The native's suspicions couldn't hold much power against visible evidence.

The native guided the group to the mine cart.

It was large enough to carry six people with room to spare. A seesaw mechanism using lever force was installed to push the mine cart.

The native gripped the seesaw and moved the mine cart.

Originally a two-person job, Rian tried to help, but when the native glared at him, he had no choice but to turn away awkwardly.

The physical strength needed to move the mine cart was certainly impressive. However, it was over 20 kilometers from here to Mount Toa. He would be exhausted if he exerted force all the way to the destination.

As the rails entered a downhill slope, the speed increased. It felt like all the air in their stomachs was falling downward at once.

The slope became gentler and leveled out, but the speed didn't decrease. It was designed to utilize gravity through subtle grade adjustments.

With this principle, they would certainly reach the autonomous zone faster than by carriage.

"Whoa! This is incredibly fast."

"Right. We'd better hold on tight."

The mine cart shook violently. If it flipped while accelerating, their lives couldn't be guaranteed.

Amy's group quietly crouched down. The native then muttered something while moving his lips in annoyance.

They couldn't hear over the noise, but it clearly wasn't anything pleasant.

As the mine cart took a curve, it felt like one wheel was lifting off. It wasn't actually a sharp curve, but the acceleration was too fast.

Arin gripped the mine cart's edge and pulled Canis's collar with her other hand. As they entered a straight route, she asked Gis.

"When do we arrive?"

"I don't know. I think it'll take at least 20 more minutes. This is my first time here too."

"But you must have heard stories about it."

"Not at all. You heard earlier. This is a secret route that only Falcoa knew about. The underlings can't even get close, and even the executives don't know much about it."

Arin calculated roughly 20 minutes. She needed time to explain her abilities to the group before arriving at Mount Toa.

Telepathy magic straddled the line between eavesdropping and confession.

Controlling with mental waves could penetrate deep into the subconscious, but had the drawback of exposing one's abilities.

Due to the nature of mental magic, once abilities were revealed, opponents would be on guard, potentially reducing effectiveness.

Therefore, it was common to send barely noticeable weak mental waves to eavesdrop on thoughts floating to the surface.

She extended her Spirit Zone, infiltrating the native's shadow. Then she extended five additional tendrils, connecting them to everyone except Gis.

Having finished preparations, Arin asked the native.

"How much longer will it take?"

When she spoke in Kergo, the native turned to look at Arin. If they had been face to face, he would have noticed the discrepancy between lip movements and pronunciation, but Arin wasn't one to make such mistakes. The mine cart's noise and rapid sensation also helped scatter his attention.

"About 10 minutes until arrival. But we'll have to go further in from there. The autonomous zone side has steep slopes, so we can't use the mine cart."

Amy's group was startled when the native's language was translated. However, no one's expression changed. They weren't inexperienced enough to show emotions on their faces.

Having heard Gis's translation, they realized his translation skills weren't particularly outstanding. Perhaps Arin's telepathy abilities were exceptional.

*Arin, did you do that?*

The reason Amy singled out Arin was because her Insight had automatically activated moments before. If she were to describe the feeling of Spirit Zone infiltration, it was at most like a gentle breeze.

If it hadn't been for her self-image memory, her thoughts would have been eavesdropped without her noticing.

*Yes. I connected a mental channel.*

*Don't tell me you're reading my mind?*

It would be terrible if Arin could read even very private inner thoughts.

Fortunately, she shook her head.

A Great Magician of the mental school could easily dominate graduating class level students, but self-image memory would still detect it.

The fact that Arin was wary of Amy was partly because she possessed Insight.

*Don't worry. This is like a tunnel of sorts. Mental schools classify human psychology into 12 levels of depth, and this corresponds to the 11th level of surface psychology. Only thoughts that have passed through the final filter are transmitted, so I can't know your inner thoughts.*

*Then what's the 12th level?*

*That's the realm of reason above the surface. Things like forced smiles or pretense. Anyway, if you strongly resist, the channel will break. Of course, if you say you don't like it, I'll cut it off myself.*

*No. If you only read surface psychology, it's an incredibly convenient ability. Let's maintain this state.*

*Thank you. I excluded Gis. I currently have the other people's transmission channels blocked. I'll open them now. But don't show it.*

When Arin opened the transmission channels, Rian and Tess's thoughts flowed in.

*...I want to talk too! Why can't I speak...! Oh? Now I can hear.*

*Me too. Tess, can you hear my voice?*

*Yeah. I can hear, I can hear. Wow, this is really amazing.*

Amy realized how convenient Arin's ability was. Though they were looking in different directions, countless conversations were taking place in the mental channel.

The fact that this was magic not encountered at magic school was also intriguing.

Dark magic was non-mainstream. Despite having excellent applicability, it had fatal weaknesses.

The attribute of darkness was weak to light.

Moreover, mental magic was difficult to attempt against opponents with higher mental strength than oneself.

However, at Arcane's level, the story was different. And Canis and Arin were direct disciples of Arcane, who had reached Great Magician status through dark magic.

'Amazing. This will really be tremendous help. Oops!'

Amy glanced at Arin. Her emotions had become agitated, causing her inner thoughts to rise to the surface.

Arin smiled in response. She was simply pleased even by Amy's calculating thoughts.

Human hearts are much more focused on desire and selfish than what shows on the surface.

Having lived her entire life reading such emotions, feelings with goodwill were nothing to Arin.

In any case, telepathy magic would demonstrate excellent effects in urgent situations or even during combat. This was another reason why Canis and Arin's joining felt more reassuring.

*Hehe! This is really fun! Amy, isn't that native annoying? I caught him sneakily peeking at my cleavage earlier.*

*Really? He seemed to be looking down on us to me.*

*I'm getting hungry. Will there be something to eat when we get there?*

The mental channel filled with chatter, gossip, and grumbling.

Unfamiliar with magic, Rian and Tess squeezed out even unnecessary thoughts, trying to use the channel somehow.

Strictly speaking, such thoughts couldn't be called thoughts. It was a moment proving that environment dominates the mind.

*This is annoyingly loud. Arin, turn down the volume. Or just turn it off.*

When Canis spoke, the volume of voices in the mental channel decreased. It felt like whispering close to the ear.

If they didn't concentrate, they could barely hear, so gradually the chatter diminished.

Tess, who had been enjoying the conversation, protested.

*What? Why did you lower the sound? I can barely hear. Turn it up quickly.*

*Don't use the mental channel unless it's strategic talk. Do you think this is some women's chat room? And it's Arin's ability. Who are you to tell her to turn it up or down?*

Tess clicked her tongue in annoyance. Still, seeing that her expression didn't change, she seemed to maintain her guard.

After the chatter passed, Arin revealed why she had demonstrated her ability.

*As you know, it's telepathy magic. I didn't do it to that person Gis. Since he's an outsider, I didn't want my abilities to be known, and even if he could be trusted, there's risk of exposure to enemies if he reacts to my ability.*

Since Gis could understand the native's words anyway, they could quietly get through this if they just didn't make it obvious.

*This really is a convenient ability.*

*Hmph, consider it one of the alliance's compensations. I don't know if Shirone passed the trial's gateway, but if we form a party, using Arin's ability will be essential.*

Canis's proud display of his partner was annoying, but it was undeniably impressive enough that they couldn't argue.

*And one more thing. The reason Arin specifically used telepathy is because there's something we haven't told you.*

*Something you haven't told us? What are you suddenly talking about?*

Amy's eyes sharpened. Though the condition of Shirone's success was involved, having variables emerge late in a temporary alliance was unwelcome.

*It's nothing major. We didn't deliberately hide it, but thought it wasn't particularly necessary to mention. Anyway, to explain: Arin and I had another reason for trying to pass the trial's gateway. Contrary to your expectations, Kergo's natives aren't friendly to outsiders. They're actually hostile.*

It certainly wasn't a big deal. They hadn't expected to be welcomed with applause from the start.

However, they hadn't thought there would be reason for hostility either.

The autonomous government and Kergo tribe had chosen a symbiotic relationship, and there were quite a few natives influenced by civilization even in the ruins.

*The reason they're hostile to outsiders is because the Galliant government made mistakes. When they first came to the island 100 years ago, they promised considerable compensation. The natives also negotiated, judging that the flow of time couldn't be stopped. The business that started this way was tourism. You know, initially even the native autonomous zone was open to the public? But now exchanges have been severed.*

*Hmm, I understand in a way. My father also faced severe opposition when first entering colonies. I think it's unavoidable.*

*There's that aspect too. But the Galliant government wasn't just at that level. They went too far, way too far.*
