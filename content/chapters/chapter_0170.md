"What on earth happened for things to turn out like this?"

"The Galliant government, having made huge profits from the tourism business, became even greedier. So they devised a new venture. Human tourism."

Silence flowed through the mental channel.

Everyone had anticipated what "human tourism" implied.

Particularly Tess—for her it was more than just anticipation. Having studied political science, she understood what had transpired between the Galliant government and the Kergo people.

"They made the worst choice humans could make."

"That's right. The Galliant government treated the Kergo people as tourist commodities, going beyond just the Kergo Ruins and culture. Of course, this fact didn't surface until much later. Initially, they supposedly just had the natives stand around so tourists could observe them while riding in carriages. But then possessive desires kicked in. It escalated to human hunting. Mercenaries captured boys and girls and sold them at high prices to nobles."

"It's fortunate a war didn't break out."

"Such is the fate of those who fall behind in civilization. Of course, Kergo's military power isn't weak. At least not weaker than the Galliant government's. But they couldn't match their political prowess. Children were being captured, and while the Galliant government was clearly the culprit, there was no evidence. They probably spent considerable money eliminating that evidence, but human hunting was so severe that it was still profitable. They were helpless. To start a fight based on mere suspicion would mean the natives dependent on tourism capital would instantly find themselves on the streets. In the end, they had no choice but to make an agreement. In exchange for opening the ruins, they sealed off entry to the autonomous zone. That's how they shut their doors and remained so until now."

Amy could deeply feel Kergo's anguish—knowing their tribal sons and daughters had been sold to nobles yet having no choice but to open their ruins.

However, regardless of their circumstances, the situation had become dangerous. That was the only thing that mattered.

This was also why Canis had brought up the topic.

"But that's not the important part. There will be villains among the natives too, and since such people actually exist, that's why Loop is being smuggled. In any case, the natives in the autonomous zone won't view us favorably. While I don't expect physical confrontation, we can't let our guard down."

"Then isn't Shirone in danger too?"

"No, that won't happen. While Kergo's first reason for opening the ruins was money, it wasn't solely for that. The Room of Achievement and Sacrifice holds special meaning for them. Kergo has been waiting for someone for a long time."

"Waiting for whom?"

"Well... an angel, perhaps?"

"An angel?"

Amy asked again, but Canis gave no response.

Arin confirmed it was time and announced through the mental channel.

"Sorry. I want to conserve my mental strength, so I'm closing the channel. Even if you reconnect later, you won't panic now, right?"

Telepathy was also magic and consumed mental strength. Particularly, the method of exchanging information in real-time through channels continuously gnawed at one's mind like a firewall.

When the mental channel closed, Amy looked straight ahead. As her hearing opened, the sound of rails filled her eardrums.

The rail car disappeared into the darkness of the tunnel.

They arrived at an underground city.

While lacking aesthetic charm, the ant-hill-like branching tunnels and plazas expanded at each tunnel junction were remarkable achievements born from coexistence with nature.

Amy returned to being a tourist and looked around. Her initial excitement was brief—her eyes wavered with bewilderment.

Kergo's way of life was disconnected from the scenery. Everyone was starving and emaciated. This was more unexpected than hearing that the Kergo people were hostile to outsiders.

Elderly people like war refugees walked along the tunnels. Those who couldn't walk leaned against earthen walls, holding children entrusted to them by their own children, eyes closed.

The desolate landscape seemed to emit cries of anguish. This place was an ant hill. And they were the ants.

Elderly people carrying heavy burdens moved away, adding seemingly impossible steps, while in corners, hunched grandmothers wove bark into baskets.

"Is this really the Kergo Autonomous Zone?"

No one could answer Amy's question. Her expectation that they were a tribe owning expensive real estate called ruins had been completely wrong.

Canis felt an unnamed anger and grabbed Arin's shoulder. Her shoulder was trembling too. She remembered—life in Radum, called the hell of the city.

Both of them knew that starving was the most terrible suffering in the world. Therefore... these people were among the world's most tormented.

"Hey, come this way."

The native who had driven the rail car gestured for them to come over. His expression clearly showed he didn't want outsiders to see the current scene.

After passing through paths that curved like rapids, they arrived at a blocked tunnel. Only a single torch hanging on the wall illuminated the surroundings.

Amy looked back at the path they had taken. Since they had detoured a long distance, even if commotion arose here, it seemed unlikely anyone outside would know.

The native led Amy's group to stand before a man.

The man with crossed arms and tightly closed mouth had an appearance that matched expectations, as if asserting he was a true Kergo person.

His upper body muscles were more developed than Rian's, and his face bore pitch-black tattoos. Both ears wore earrings made from predator fangs.

When Gis spoke to him, he introduced himself as Mahatu.

Amy recalled hearing earlier that there was a pronunciation called Mahatu among the descendants of warriors.

Mahatu, whose name meant warrior, was indeed a warrior.

"Uh, so this person's name is Mahatu. He raises Loop and supplies it to the temple."

Amy guessed that black tattoos were the color for those who managed Loop. If white was for those who conducted ceremonies, then black might be for those who prepared ceremonies.

Since Arin wasn't attempting telepathy, Amy's group had no choice but to wait for Gis to interpret.

Tess thought this was the right decision. Given Mahatu's temperament, he was no ordinary strongman. If he had sensory-based Schema, there was a risk he might detect telepathy.

When everyone was thinking such thoughts, Mahatu's words suddenly became understandable.

When Amy turned around, Arin smiled.

"You ended up trying it after all? That person looks quite strong. You're tougher than you look."

"No. I didn't cast telepathy on Mahatu."

"Huh? Then how is the translation working?"

Arin quietly pointed to Gis.

Amy finally understood. She had cast telepathy on Gis, who was conversing with Mahatu.

If one only intended to eavesdrop on surface-level linguistic thoughts, there was no need to make contact with the speaker directly. This was another strength of Arin's ability.

"Falcoa is dead?"

"Yes. The Freeman organization won't be purchasing Loop. We're planning to leave the island soon."

Gis spoke honestly. Having met the person in charge, there was no way to hide the truth.

As expected, Mahatu's complexion darkened. Looking at Amy's group with a harsh gaze, he widened his eyes and asked back.

"Then what are those people?"

"Ah, they're not here to buy Loop, but they came in because they have business here."

"Business? Don't you know that outsiders cannot enter this place except for Loop transactions?"

"I know that, but we still had to inform you about the deal cancellation. And we also have a pass...! Whoa!"

Mahatu pushed Gis aside and walked over. His clenched jaw twitched and his eyes seemed ready to shoot fire.

After examining the group, he picked Amy as his conversation partner. Not because he thought she was the leader. She was the only one glaring back defiantly.

"You were sent by the Freeman organization? Then are you an organization member?"

Gis ran over to interpret. Even in this situation, seeing him fulfill his duty showed his sense of responsibility was extraordinary.

Of course, Amy understood the words through Arin. However, she couldn't reveal this, so she answered a beat late.

"No. But I'm well acquainted with Freeman."

"How well acquainted? Well enough to stake your life?"

"Of course. We actually have done that."

The lies flowed smoothly. Since they had actually fought risking their lives, it wasn't entirely false.

"Then you could pay the remaining balance on their behalf."

"Remaining balance? What remaining balance?"

"Falcoa recently took 8 kilograms of Loop after paying only a down payment. He failed to pay the remaining balance."

Recalling Falcoa's face, Amy snorted. He had put on all sorts of airs but was actually conducting petty credit transactions.

Anyway, since there was money to be collected, she had to ask.

"While I'd stake my life, I'm not close enough to lend money, but how much is he behind?"

"10,000 gold."

"What? 10,000?"

Amy's eyes widened. Even Gis, who had done the translation, seemed confused as if he had misheard the amount.

But Amy knew precisely through Arin's telepathy that it was 10,000 gold.

She had thought it was just 8 kilograms of tree roots. But 10,000 gold? No, since he had paid a down payment, it meant at least 10,000 gold or more.

She suddenly became curious.

Unknown to her, Falcoa had probably been purchasing Loop for huge sums for five years. Then how should the Kergo people's living conditions be explained?

Just selling 8 kilograms of Loop could feed all the people in the plaza to their hearts' content for a year. It was something that didn't make sense logically.

Gis tried to persuade Mahatu.

"I'll report about the remaining balance when I return to the organization. They'll take care of it, whether returning the Loop or paying the balance."

Uncertain, Gis looked back at his friends seeking agreement.

Tess nodded. Freeman and Marsha, who valued honor, would definitely pay the remaining balance.

Encouraged by her support, Gis spoke confidently.

"See, that's settled then? We'll pay the balance later, so let us stay here for now."

"I don't understand. Then what purpose brought you here?"

Amy spoke up.

"We're waiting for a friend. He entered the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice. He'll probably come here soon."

Her tone was more prickly than before. Seeing how they earned huge amounts yet didn't resolve their own people's starvation made her think Mahatu and Falcoa were the same type of person.

"The Room of Achievement and Sacrifice?"

Mahatu examined the group carefully. Evaluating not their appearance but their character, he smiled mockingly and said.

"Your dreams are big. Give up and go back. Your friend is probably waiting outside."

"Hah! How would you know that?"

"It's obvious. The altar wasn't built to summon greenhorns like you. Countless amateurs come seeking the Kergo Ruins. To buy Loop, to obtain gold. Did you think we'd allow it just because you sent your friend to the altar and came here to argue? You'll never pass through with that level of shallow cunning."

"What makes you think you're so great? Have you ever thought about how many people have become addicted from the Loop smuggled from this place?"

"Loop is a sacred item. You're the ones who abuse it as drugs. And I have no need to know about the circumstances of foolish outsiders. You've always been like that. Always trying to judge and steal what's ours. But it won't be easy here."

"We're not going back. Not until we know whether our friend passed through the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice."

"You could never qualify with your abilities. Tell me your real purpose for coming here."

The native who had driven the rail car spoke up.

"They might be thieves. Here to steal gold."

There was no longer any pretentious smile on the native's expression. If it wasn't for Loop trading, Amy's group were just outsiders he despised most—nobles at that.

"That's possible. All the more reason not to let them in."

"How about searching their bodies? If they snuck in weapons or something, the villagers could get hurt."

Though they were enemies, Mahatu didn't want to touch a woman's body. It would be shameful for a warrior.

Yet he remained silent because he knew what his companion was implying.
