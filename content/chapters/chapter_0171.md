title: Chapter 171 - Kergo Autonomous Zone (3)
date: 2025-08-29

Outsiders trampled on Kergo with all manner of excuses and pretenses. Countless women had lost their purity under the pretext of body searches. No matter how misguided his comrade's hatred might be, siding with outsiders was impossible.

"I'll begin the inspection now. You there, come here and raise your arms."

Amy held her ground, her stance conveying both refusal and wariness.

If the man hadn't been a master, she would have struck his stomach the moment he insulted her, but his killing intent was far from ordinary. If a fight broke out, she'd have to prepare for chaos, and this wasn't a good place for that.

"This is going too far."

Rian stepped in front of Amy. While Amy might be better at assessing situations, if the opponent intended to assault a woman's dignity, it was right for him to intervene.

"Even though Falcoa is dead, the Freeman organization is still intact. If you treat us like this, you won't remain unharmed either, will you?"

Rian's strategy of invoking Freeman's authority was clever. Amy thought it was a good approach too.

However, the Kergo native was far more aggressive than expected.

As if his reverse scale had been touched, Mahatu's face reddened.

"Is that a challenge? Come at me all you want. Kergo people don't run away."

-Everyone step back. Mahatu's mind is focusing.

Arin warned through the mental channel.

By the time her words ended, everyone could feel it. Even the insensitive Rian could detect the murderous aura.

Amy aimed her Spirit Zone. The battle strategy would depend on how high Mahatu's fighting spirit soared.

Buuuuuuuu!

Just then, the sound of a horn trumpet echoed from the depths of the cave.

If it could be heard deep inside the winding tunnels, one could imagine how loud it must be.

As the trumpet sound spread throughout the entire cave, Mahatu looked toward the entrance with surprised eyes.

His companion's reaction was even more severe. He was trembling as if he couldn't believe it.

"Mahatu, this is the trumpet of truth. How could this possibly..."

Before his companion could finish speaking, Mahatu launched himself forward.

"Damn it! Why the trumpet of truth! Has a war broken out?"

The trumpet of truth was the highest-level alert signal set by the Kergo tribe. Upon hearing this sound, all tribe members must immediately gather at the source of the sound. There were no exceptions regardless of class, and those who failed to attend would face punishment.

With the natives gone, Amy's group also fell into confusion.

"What's going on? Something must have happened outside."

"Let's go check it out. It's dangerous to be stuck in a dead end."

Amy's group left the cave and arrived at the source of the sound.

It was a massive plaza where seven tunnels met in the center.

Natives were gathering, but there were so many that it was impossible to determine what was happening.

The combined murmuring made it difficult to hear individual voices. They hoped for the mental channel, but Arin was just staring at the platform.

"Kneel and worship! A messenger of the god who will save us has come!"

An old man on the platform shouted. Then over a thousand people knelt and spoke in unison.

"We welcome the messenger of god."

The crowd collapsed as if the world was ending. The view to the platform opened up, and they could see Shirone standing before the old man.

Shirone, who had been looking around, met Amy's eyes. They had been separated for only two hours, but having experienced so many bewildering situations, he couldn't contain his emotion.

"Amy."

Those who had been crying out about the messenger of god fell silent. The silence spread in concentric circles, and several people looked at Amy.

Mahatu was among them. Amy felt she would never forget the sight of his face being colored with bewilderment.

"Shirone."

The natives' gaze turned back to Shirone. Their attitude suggested they wouldn't miss a single word that came from his mouth.

Shirone's face turned sorrowful.

"Amy, why are these people acting like this? I can't understand a single word they're saying."

Watching Shirone, who looked ready to burst into tears at any moment, Amy scratched her eyebrow.

And she thought to herself:

How would I know?

@

As Shirone moved, the crowd split like bamboo. The fact that they remained orderly even in their bowing posture was proof of their tension.

Shirone's face looked haggard. Having been exposed to an unknown language for two hours, it was only natural.

Usually when language doesn't work, people give up on conversation, but the temple executors hadn't left Shirone alone for even a moment.

"I thought I was going to die of frustration. Every time I said anything, they'd bow, so I ended up not saying a word. Why are these people acting like that toward me?"

"I don't know. We just got here too. Did you pass the test?"

"Yeah, I think so, but there's a bit of a problem."

"A problem? What kind of problem?"

Explaining the scene he had witnessed in the Labyrinth of Time and Space would require a lengthy explanation. But there was no time for that now, and the situation wasn't good either.

The old man who had blown the horn trumpet approached Shirone.

Mahatu followed behind the old man. His mind was complicated. If this was truly a messenger of god, it meant he had opened all eight sections of the Labyrinth of Time and Space, but contrary to what he had always imagined, it was shocking that he was a boy with soft down on his cheeks.

-Absolute obedience to the messenger of god.

These were words he had heard since childhood until his ears were callused.

It was on a different dimension from the religious faith that outsiders spoke of. Just as subjects obey their king, to the Kergo people, god was a power that actually existed.

Mahatu quickened his pace and approached Shirone. If he truly was the messenger of god, he had to pay for his rudeness to Amy's group before facing the old man.

"Revered messenger of god, if I may be so bold, are these people here your companions?"

When Gis approached to interpret, Mahatu raised his hand to stop him.

"No, someone seems to be using mental magic. If that person is here, please let them help the messenger of god communicate."

Mahatu had realized this fact from the moment Amy's voice had risen.

Usually when conversing through an interpreter, words become simple and short, but in several parts, he had felt that they understood Kergo quite accurately.

Arin's Spirit Zone seeped into Mahatu's shadow.

Shirone was startled by the voice ringing in his head, but realizing what kind of ability it was, he nodded.

Understanding this as a sign that preparations were complete, Mahatu asked his earlier question again.

"Messenger of god, are these people truly your companions?"

"Yes. They're my friends."

Mahatu nodded gravely. He wasn't afraid of dying, but being rude to Shirone's friends was a mistake that put the fate of his entire clan at risk.

Kergo's destruction wasn't due to loops, civil war, or volcanic eruptions. Officially, that's how it's been passed down, but behind it lay a truth that no one knew.

The Kergo people had angered an angel.

And the boy standing before him was a descendant of that angel.

The 500-year-old story passed down through generations had taken root as a deep-seated fear in the unconscious of the Kergo people living in the present age.

Mahatu's expression began to change. From dismay to fear, then, as if having made his resolution, he regained his original expression and knelt with enough force to shatter his knees, shouting:

"I'm sorry! Please kill me! I have committed great rudeness to your companions!"

"Rudeness? What rudeness? You didn't use violence, did you?"

Shirone, whose wariness was triggered by their almost fanatic behavior, snapped immediately. If they had laid a hand on his friends, he had no intention of forgiving them.

"Oh, it's nothing serious. We just had a little spat. You know, the usual stuff we do."

Amy's words were almost coded. There had indeed been a clash, but the situation was complicated, so she hoped he would let it slide.

Mahatu looked up at Amy with gratitude. And feeling relieved that he hadn't caused a crisis for his race, he yielded his position to the old man.

The old man, who introduced himself as Hashid, an elder of the Kergo tribe, asked Shirone a meaningful question.

"Have you come bearing a message from the Labyrinth?"

Shirone recalled the scene he had witnessed in the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice. Though it had passed so quickly that only fragments of information remained, each piece was vivid.

When Shirone nodded, the elder turned around, leaning on his staff.

The natives gathered in the plaza were waiting for an answer.

"At last, a messenger of god has descended upon Kergo!"

Shirone's group covered their ears. As soon as Hashid's words fell, the natives let out warrior battle cries.

The cave filled with sound as if it would burst the ceiling.

Among the cries of joy, occasional sobs could be heard. Ragged figures pushed through the crowd and knelt before Shirone.

"Messenger of god, our child is sick. Please heal him."

Since Arin's channel was also connected to Mahatu, they could understand her words. But Shirone didn't have the ability to heal sick children.

An old man who crawled up beside the woman clasped his hands together and held them forward, pleading:

"Please give us food! Our families are starving."

Starting with that, people arrived one after another.

"Grant me eternal life!"

"Please spare only my daughter Atore! That child has a man she's engaged to!"

"Please make me a woman!"

Arin covered not only her ears but closed her eyes as well. The scene transmitted through her insight was all red light, like looking at boiling lava. If she accepted any more of people's yearning, her mind might collapse.

"Canis! The voices of their hearts are too loud!"

"Close the channel. You might get hurt."

Shirone was trapped in the crowd, unable to move a single step. Though Arin had canceled the telepathy making interpretation impossible, waves of emotion continued to flood in endlessly, squeezing his heart. It was like mass hypnosis. The keyword would be madness.

Shirone looked back at Hashid and Mahatu for help. But they were only watching their people with sad eyes.

"Everyone be quiet!"

At the man's booming shout, it instantly became quiet.

A young man flanked by sturdy warriors on both sides walked from the northern tunnel. Though not large in stature, his balloon-like bulging muscles overwhelmed even his escorts. His hair was long and swept back, and his face was engraved with golden tattoos.

Only then did Arin open her closed eyes.

The emotion of the natives seen through her insight was awe.

But that wasn't all.

They were afraid. The kind of insight commonly seen when facing an iron-fisted ruler. The man was undoubtedly the leader of Kergo.

The man who approached Shirone introduced himself.

"I am Kadum, chief of Kergo. From now on, I will serve you."

Shirone asked his friends for their opinion.

No one objected. To gain anything in the autonomous zone, they would have to meet this person eventually anyway.

And this was where Gis's mission ended.

Shirone expressed his regret as he spoke.

"We'll handle it from here ourselves. It could be dangerous."

Gis nodded without showing any particular offense. Not letting useless pride get in the way was why Shirone's group trusted him.

Shaking hands, Gis said with concern:

"Be careful. The autonomous zone seems very different from the Kergo I know."

"Yeah. Nothing serious will happen. And thanks for interpreting."

"I'm glad I could help. When you're done, stop by our house. Yuna and I will have lots of delicious food ready."

Shirone asked Kadum to escort Gis to the ruins. Then everyone volunteered to follow Shirone's instructions, offering to serve as guides. Arin chose someone trustworthy.

Gis left the Kergo Autonomous Zone following the massive warrior.

Kadum guided Shirone's group into the cave.

Even after walking for twenty minutes, their destination didn't appear. If this path was a dead end, any traveler would collapse.

Not all labyrinths require complex designs. The autonomous zone's labyrinth overwhelmed with sheer scale.
