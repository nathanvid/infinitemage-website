Fortunately, there was an exit. As the taste of the air changed, they emerged halfway up the four-sided stepped altar.

The jungle of Mount Toa spread out like a vast sea beneath their feet.

The forest viewed from 20 meters above sea level was expansive, with Kergo villages scattered here and there.

Going around to the opposite side of the altar, they saw a palace made of gold. It was the residence of the Kergo chieftain. Upon entering the palace, they found a long hall with tables arranged in two rows.

Shirone sat at the head table, with Amy and Rian to his right, followed by Tess, Canis, and Arin in that order.

On the left side sat Chieftain Kadum and the elders. Hashid, who had blown the horn trumpet, was not present. Seeing that Mahatu was also seated near the end suggested his rank was not particularly low.

Music played and traditional Kergo food was served. Before they could even taste it, warriors entered carrying large chests in pairs.

The warriors opened the lids of the chests. An enormous amount of gold coins and jewels were piled high inside.

"What is this?"

"A humble gift from Kergo. Please accept it."

The value had surpassed the level where it could be calculated by counting and needed to be weighed. The five chests combined seemed to weigh at least one ton.

Amy set down her food with a displeased expression.

This wasn't income from the ruins. It was money earned by smuggling Loops. And with that money, they could feed the entire tribe and still have plenty left over.

"Shirone, surely you're not thinking of accepting this?"

"I can't accept such a large sum without knowing the reason. It's not like they're just giving it away for nothing."

When Shirone demanded an explanation, Kadum's eyes changed.

Even the most saintly person would have their breathing change upon seeing over a ton of gold coins. But Shirone reacted with indifference, as if the gold coins were mere stones.

It wasn't that Shirone was detached from material wealth. He simply wasn't foolish enough to obsess over something that wasn't his.

Kadum wasn't flustered. Instead of providing an explanation, he clapped his hands and the second offering was brought in.

He was confident that even someone who refused wealth wouldn't be able to resist this.

Men with white tattoos on their faces, like the man in the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice, entered. Shirone guessed they were priests.

As they stepped aside to the left and right, over ten young and beautiful Kergo women entered.

Shirone and the other boys stared with their mouths agape. It was a scene difficult to encounter at their age.

The beautiful women, practically naked, were approaching while performing sensual dances.

From a distance, it seemed like a rather splendid dance, but up close it was utterly lewd. The women's eyes appeared hazy, as if they had fallen into a trance state.

"How do you find them? These are the most beautiful priestesses among Kergo women. They are the second offering to the messenger of god. I hope they please you."

Shirone felt the seat beside him grow hot. Without turning his head, he could tell what expression Amy was making.

Kadum's goodwill had backfired.

The priestesses' group dance was enchanting, but to Shirone it only looked like the writhing of women intoxicated by Loops.

Since unwarranted kindness tends to feel like a threat, his heart only grew colder as he analyzed Kadum's true intentions.

Seeing Shirone's stubborn reaction, Kadum finally began to worry.

An unlocker's mind may be more noble than that of ordinary people, but that doesn't make them saints. Immortal Function is merely a process toward nirvana, not enlightenment itself.

If he were truly free from the five desires and seven emotions, he wouldn't have approached the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice in the first place. Kadum couldn't grasp what Shirone wanted.

"I seem to have misjudged. I thought you would be pleased. Actually, this is my first time receiving a messenger of god, so I was simply following tradition."

Shirone found those words even more distasteful. How lewdly had other unlockers of his level behaved for it to become a "tradition"?

"Did they enjoy this sort of thing?"

"According to records, they didn't seem to dislike it. But please don't misunderstand. There's no other intention - it's merely tradition. Kergo may be a tribal society, but the priests hold great power. Priests are divided into clerics and warriors, and among the clerics, women become priestesses. According to Kergo law, priestesses must be beautiful and maintain their purity for life, but they may sleep with someone once to bear an angel's child. In other words, the priestesses are prepared to sacrifice everything for Shirone, who is a descendant of angels."

"If I were to accept these women, what would I have to do?"

A chieftain wouldn't suffer such losses without compensation. Even traditions are merely customs born of necessity.

The amount of gold could feed the entire tribe. Moreover, the women performing courtship dances for Shirone's selection were future mothers who could increase Kergo's population. Ultimately, they were offering the tribe's entire wealth and future to Shirone.

"The Kergo people are children of the great Ra. Also, the descendant of angels is the only being who can connect the Kergo tribe with god. Please convey our faith to the deity."

"By god, do you mean Ankera?"

"Anke Ra. It means the eternal and immortal Ra. He has existed since the beginning and created us. With his great power, he continues to watch over us even now."

Stripped of religious content, it was ultimately a proposal for a deal.

Accept gold and women as payment, then go to god and convey the tribe's wishes. He didn't know how this would be conveyed, but it was certainly connected to Immortal Function.

The mental channel buzzed with discussion about whether to accept the payment.

Tess was against it. Money aside, she couldn't even imagine Shirone sleeping with other women while leaving Amy behind.

But contrary to expectations, Amy was in favor of accepting the payment. And Shirone agreed as well.

"Shirone! How could you? They say all men are beasts, but I trusted you."

"Don't get excited. Shirone must have some plan. Amy agreed too."

"How ridiculous! Rian, are you taking his side because you're both men? I absolutely cannot agree. Amy, say something. Honestly, aren't you annoyed?"

"Of course I'm annoyed. It's unpleasant that they're holding a feast while the tribespeople starve. But that's something Shirone can control. First, it's important to gather more information, so let's agree."

While Shirone's group exchanged thoughts, a white-haired old man entered. It was Elder Hashid, who had blown the horn trumpet. His eyes bloodshot as he looked at the elders absorbed in eating and entertainment.

Mahatu noticed and stood up to show respect.

"Have you come, Elder?"

"Tsk tsk, how pathetic. What in the world is all this commotion?"

As the music stopped, the girls who had been dancing collapsed in exhaustion.

Hashid walked toward Shirone, supporting himself with his staff like a person with three legs.

Kadum blocked his approach with an authoritative tone.

"What are you doing, Father? Ruining a sacred banquet."

"Sacred banquet? Outside, tribespeople are starving to death every other day. If we keep wasting money on futile things like this, the tribe will truly be ruined!"

"How surprising that the former chieftain of Kergo and elder of noble status would speak such nonsense. Would you dare make that statement in council?"

"That wouldn't do. The tribespeople are filled with hope at the appearance of the messenger of god. But that's as far as it goes. Why don't you understand that what they want is happiness, not the messenger of god!"

"I've heard the opinion of a mere elder. No matter what anyone says, I am the chieftain. Kergo will be reborn through god's grace. We won't live holed up in the mountains, watching outsiders' faces - we'll recreate the glorious civilization of the past!"

Hashid twitched his beard, clicked his tongue, and turned away.

In any case, Kadum was the chieftain. If the conflict escalated in front of the elders, there was no guarantee that the civil war from 500 years ago wouldn't happen again.

As the atmosphere grew heavy, the elders quietly slipped away, and eventually the banquet ended.

Kadum led Shirone's group to the top of the altar. The rooftop was spacious, and to the north stood a seven-meter-tall statue. The moonlit giant figure radiated an intimidating presence.

Kadum stood where the statue was and looked up at the night sky.

Countless stars floated there.

But there was only one star he was looking at.

"Do you see that cluster of stars in the northern sky? Connect them in a figure-eight pattern, then find the brightest star at the point where the two circles intersect."

They had followed him thinking he had something to show them, only to receive a constellation lecture. Shirone's group was reluctant but took the time to find the star Kadum indicated.

Shocking words came from Kadum's mouth.

"That star is Kergo's homeland."

"What? Homeland?"

The homeland Shirone thought of was one's birthplace. The place that young people who moved to the city longed for with nostalgia. Certainly not somewhere far away in the night sky.

"The Kergo people know that the god who created us lives there. We are born and die on this earth, but our souls fly to that sky. The kingdom of heaven. That's why we call that star paradise."

Shirone was perplexed.

Paradise is a conceptual place. Not somewhere you introduce to foreign travelers like a tourist attraction.

"I don't quite understand. Why do you say that place is paradise?"

"You don't believe in god, do you, Shirone?"

Shirone neither believed nor disbelieved in god.

A magician's thinking doesn't reach clear conclusions about things that cannot be analyzed.

To Shirone, god was a being whose existence or non-existence was unknowable.

"Kergo's Genesis contains this content. It's mythology from before history. In the beginning, giants lived, and humans were born from the giants' blood and flesh. The first human was Garok, who lived to be seven hundred and eighty-two years old. Their child Deris lived 982 years, and his son Theseus lived 1,320 years."

Ra's Genesis wasn't much different from the myths of other religions.

According to some scholars, the lifespans of figures appearing before history don't represent actual lifespans but the duration of family rule.

Elzain I, Elzain II - if a family prospered for about thirteen generations like that, the myth would feature Elzain who lived a thousand years.

It was a plausible story.

Even the Kingdom of Tormia had royal names passed down through generations. The current king was Adolf XII.

Kadum recited the lifespans of people he'd never heard of before, as if showing off his memorization skills.

When the age of mythology ended, they entered the age of history.

"Two thousand years ago, the prophet Hanes established civilization in this place. From then on, we came to rest in Ra's embrace. You've probably wondered why we don't restore the Kergo ruins buried under volcanic ash."

Shirone recalled the thick barrier that even Amy's Sniper Mode couldn't penetrate, cutting through the middle layer of the ruins.

"There are countless ancient ruins in the world, and this place is one of them. But there's a hidden fact about the ruins that ordinary people don't know. Long ago, our ancestors seem to have freely traveled to and from paradise. The underground facilities of the ruins prove this."

"What exactly is underground that makes you say that?"

By this point, Shirone couldn't bear not to listen.

Kadum stared intently into Shirone's curious eyes and said:

"Underground in the ruins, there's a gate installed that can take you to paradise."

His head rang as if struck by a hammer. Paradise? Surely he didn't mean the star floating in the northern sky?

That place was in space.

It was a distance absolutely unreachable by human capability.

"Are you saying you can go to the place where god exists?"

"Yes. Exactly that."

A sudden thought occurred to him. Was this chieftain named Kadum insane? Or was he telling the truth?
