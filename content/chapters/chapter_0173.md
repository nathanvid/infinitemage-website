title: Chapter 173 - Kergo Autonomous Zone (5)

His friends' expressions were equally grave. The only ones showing no emotional change were Canis and Arin.

"This is why we cannot open the Kergo autonomous zone. The door underground can only be opened by one who has inherited the power of angels. That is why we have been waiting for you."

A door to Heaven. It wasn't entirely preposterous. Shirone had experienced going to the Labyrinth of Time and Space through Immortal Function.

However, this time the scale was different. A world created by magicians and Heaven were not the same. Kadum was speaking of a place where God existed.

"Since ancient times, angels have been mediators connecting God and humans. They have transcended time and space to convey God's will. I understand that an Unlocker is one who inherited the power of angels. Please, restore Kergo's glory. For this, our tribe is prepared to make any sacrifice."

Shirone couldn't answer. Go meet God and return? What could one accomplish by going to a star floating in the sky?

"Kergo has faced countless crises. Volcanic eruptions brought disaster, and we even fought civil wars. We suffered all manner of humiliation from outsiders. The tribe faces extinction. The people are starving. But we believe that the descendant of angels will revitalize Kergo."

Amy pointed accusingly and asked.

"Why don't you buy food? Relying on faith when you could be self-sufficient is like gambling with your lives. We know that the smuggling profits from Loop exceed imagination."

"Kergo's situation is worse than you know. The ruins' income we share with the Galliant government cannot feed twenty thousand people. Even if we survive by selling Loop, we'll be devoured by outsiders just like a hundred years ago. As chief, I have been praying for God's blessing while accumulating great wealth."

"Even so, money and women—did you really think you could persuade God's messenger with such methods?"

"I don't know about that. I simply sought methods through records. According to Kergo's history, one of God's messengers demanded one hundred million gold as the condition for going to Heaven."

Shirone was startled to hear that someone had already gone to Heaven. Moreover, demanding one hundred million gold when he wasn't even a merchant—it was something only someone who valued money more than life could say.

No, perhaps he was skilled enough not to fear even going to Heaven. But was such a thing possible?

"What happened to that person? Did he return safely?"

"Of course. Two hundred years ago, God's messenger departed for Heaven with his companions and returned having heard the great will of Ra."

"How did he return? Did he come out through the entrance?"

"Impossible. As you might guess, Heaven's door operates through Immortal Function. Immortal Function is only possible because the door exists. But since there's no medium in Heaven to operate Immortal Function, returning requires a different method."

"What method?"

"I know nothing about that. However, records remain that they said it wasn't a profitable business upon their return."

Silence fell.

If warriors strong enough to treat even the unknown space where God existed as a business opportunity said it wasn't profitable, it meant returning with one's own power was impossible.

Canis's words finally made sense. Not being able to return was, in some ways, more serious than death.

It wasn't like taking a ship to a distant country. It was traveling through spacetime to reach a star somewhere.

"I'm being honest with you. I know it's dangerous. But the tribe's fate hangs in the balance. If you help Kergo, we'll do everything we can. If you want gold, we'll give it. If you want Kergo women..."

"No, I don't want anything. I don't think I can accept compensation."

At the banquet, he had agreed just to hear them out, but the situation was different now.

Honestly, even if they offered billions, his mind wouldn't change. However... he felt an intense curiosity that matched the fear of death.

Having thought of the best answer, Shirone spoke without needing to ask his friends' opinions.

"Let me think about it."

Left alone on the altar, Kadum gazed at the stars.

The servile appearance he had shown Shirone's group was gone. Standing with his chin raised like the ruler of Mount Toa, he turned his gaze upon sensing a presence.

An old man walked from the altar's entrance, coughing. It was Elder Hashid.

"Are you really going to send them?"

When Hashid used respectful language, Kadum's expression twisted.

"Father, such speech to your son is inappropriate."

"Son? You know my son no longer exists in this world, don't you, Father?"

It was an odd situation where both called each other father. Of course, it was more bizarre for the white-haired Hashid to call the robust Kadum father.

Kadum revealed his true nature. In his flashing eyes could be glimpsed the experience of one who had lived over two hundred years.

"Hmph, are you still misunderstanding? Kadum's death was an accident. I didn't kill him."

"Of course you'd say that. But if my son hadn't died, a father named Kang wouldn't have been able to become chief again under Kadum's name."

Kadum turned toward Hashid.

"What do you want to say?"

"Father, they cannot succeed. Even if that boy is God's messenger, he won't be able to bring back what our tribe desires."

"It doesn't matter. The wealth remains here anyway. If they bring back what we want, I don't care how much we give them, but if they fail, we just dispose of them. Everything is for Kergo."

"Is that really so? Father obtained three hundred years of life through God's messenger two hundred years ago. That had nothing to do with Kergo, did it?"

Hashid glared at Kadum with contempt.

The child was so aged he could barely walk, but the father was enjoying his youth with firm muscles and a smooth body.

After gaining three hundred years of life, the chief went wild. He searched for Unlockers everywhere to extend his lifespan and spent enormous funds. When the tribe's wealth dwindled, he even sold Loop to outsiders.

On one hand, it seemed unavoidable.

Eternal life. Eternal youth. If one could obtain that, what in the world would be too precious?

"Isn't this enough now? Since that day, countless Unlockers have departed, but not one has returned. Obsessing over immortality makes one lose humanity. Lady Miro realized this early and issued warnings."

"Shut up! There's no chief who can lead the tribe as strongly as I can. Have you forgotten how miserable Kergo was during your time as chief? You're just a failed leader. Kergo needs me. I am Kergo itself!"

Watching Kadum roar at the sky, Hashid could say nothing.

Father was strong. He was a cunning old fox over two hundred years old with powerful force. As he boasted, he might well raise the tribe up.

But perhaps... with him, Kergo would finally disappear from the world.

Shirone's group headed to their lodging.

The caves extending northwest from the plaza were complex, but for Shirone, who had moved through Estas like his own home, it was just an area with many annoying forks.

The lodging was a large room with beds they hadn't expected. Moreover, there were even storage cabinets beside the beds.

A room for outsiders. How many people had stayed here so far? Did they depart for Heaven? Or had they now vanished from the world?

The chief's words were so shocking that even after arriving at the lodging, everyone remained silent.

After unpacking and organizing their belongings in the storage cabinets, people looked at Canis. God's messenger, Heaven, Kergo's situation. Now it was his turn to reveal what he knew.

"I kept my promise. So explain."

"Just as it sounds. You heard it all."

Amy sat beside Shirone. Then she faced Canis and snapped.

"Heaven? Does such a place really exist? How long have you known?"

"Honestly, I'm not certain either. Besides, you'd get a faster answer to that question from Shirone. Hashid asked you. What did you see in the Labyrinth of Time and Space?"

Amy turned to Shirone and asked.

"That's right. Shirone, tell us. What did you see?"

"Not what, but where."

Canis's guess was accurate. Shirone nodded readily and continued his explanation.

"Right. It was some place."

There was a sea and forests were visible. At the center of a city surrounded by circular walls stood a spire.

Shirone was drawn into the light atop the spire, and when he came to, he had already returned to the altar.

"That's everything I saw. If that place was Heaven, then Kadum's story isn't entirely preposterous. That's why I want to hear what Canis has to say before making a judgment. Just how much did you know?"

Harvest, who had been standing guard at the door, returned to Canis. Though he usually never stopped spewing crude words, now he maintained only silence.

"My master Arcane... seems to have been to a place called Heaven."

Shirone rose from the bed.

Arcane had been to Heaven. Since he had been holed up in a dungeon for fifty years after being betrayed by Alpheas, it would have been much earlier.

"You mean Arcane also came to the Kergo Ruins?"

"No. It would have been somewhere else. As Kadum said, ruins throughout the world seem to be connected to Heaven in some way. Of course, they're controlled by their respective nations, but eighty years ago, they didn't even know of their existence. In that sense, the Kergo Ruins are unique."

Eighty years ago, Arcane would have been only sixty years old. Though not young by human standards, considering how strong the 149-year-old Arcane was, his magical power could be considered at its peak.

"What's in Heaven? What kind of place is it exactly?"

"I don't know that either."

Shirone narrowed his eyes.

Not knowing didn't make sense. If Arcane had experienced Heaven, Canis should know about Heaven. Because Harvest had inherited Arcane's knowledge.

Harvest supplemented the explanation.

"Canis is telling the truth. Arcane erased his memories of Heaven. The only fact we know is that he went to Heaven."

"He erased his own memories?"

"Yes. He erased them completely. So we don't know what he did there. Probably he didn't want stories about Heaven to become known to the world."

Shirone, who knew Arcane's character, couldn't believe it. What secret could a Grade 3 Great Magician acknowledged by the world have had to hide by erasing his memories?

"Canis, what is Heaven? Is it really a place where God lives?"

"Nothing is certain. That's exactly why we're going. I need to see it with my own eyes. So take me there."

"No, I've changed my mind. You were right. It's too dangerous. It's not a place you can go to out of curiosity."

"No, your thoughts don't matter. The deal I proposed was to send me and Arin there. No matter what happens, we will definitely enter Heaven."

"Honestly, I don't want to send you either. They said once you enter, you can't return through the original door. Besides, if I don't go, they won't permit the use of Heaven's door. The chief seemed desperate."
