title: Chapter 174 - Kergo Autonomous Zone (6)

Shirone was right. As evidenced by the difficulty of the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice alone, the Kergo people didn't want just any riffraff.

Someone who could prove their strength in the Labyrinth of Time and Space, or who could open all eight simultaneously. Unless you were at that level, you couldn't even enter the autonomous zone, let alone reach heaven's gate.

—Canis, it seems like it's time to bring that out. If Shirone won't go, we can't reach heaven either.

—But this is unexpected. I didn't think he'd be this frightened.

—If we're being generous, we could call it insight. It seems his intuition is working based on the information he's heard. Anyway, let's get started.

Having gathered Harvest's opinion, Canis looked around at everyone. Then he extended his hand and casually broached the subject.

"What if I... had a way to return to this place?"

**Gate of Guffin (1)**

Like electricity flowing through the room, light flashed in the eyes of Shirone's group. This was a new development.

The reason Shirone perceived heaven as dangerous was because the probability of return was remarkably low. But if there was an escape route, the story would be different.

"Tell us more. What do you mean by a way to return?"

"As you know, the inheritance our master left us was stolen by the Magic Association. We ended up on the streets. We didn't want to receive help from Alpheas either. Anyway, while we were figuring out what we could do, Harvest dredged up an old memory. While you were attending school, we traveled with Arin. We discovered a secret location that the great magician Viktor Arcane absolutely didn't want to reveal. Because our memories were erased, even the Magic Association couldn't find this place."

"Are you saying there was a way to return here in that secret location?"

"No. This isn't just about that level. Let me show you directly."

Arin pulled a cubic box from her bosom.

Patterns were carved into its surface with intaglio and relief. It was close to black, but cast rainbow colors depending on the direction of incoming light. Like a cube, it had gaps that seemed like they would rotate if turned by hand.

Tess had never seen what Arin was holding. But she had heard countless times about that color that caused diffuse reflection and those inimitable patterns.

"That's an ancient artifact. It's made from metal that doesn't exist in the world, and its surface is carved with patterns imbued with magical power. I heard it can't be used until the seal is broken because of a powerful locking mechanism. Am I right?"

"Right. To add to that, this one has its lock released. It can be used right now."

Tess's eyes gleamed.

The reason the Elzaine family collected information about ancient weapons was because they possessed tremendous power capable of shaking national foundations.

As far as she knew, breaking the seals on ancient artifacts was internationally taboo. If any nation released the locks on artifacts, it would be tantamount to gesturing that they were prepared to wage war against the world.

"May I take a look?"

When Shirone spoke, Arin handed over the ancient artifact. His friends crowded around Shirone's bed.

Shirone rubbed the surface and examined the gaps. As he was turning it this way and that, he must have triggered some mechanism because the cube split along its centerline and revealed a glass tube.

Startled, Shirone pressed on the cube, but it seemed to have locked in place and wouldn't close.

Indecipherable characters appeared inside the glass tube. Not knowing what the object was used for, the possibility of explosion couldn't be ruled out.

"Wow, it's pretty."

Tess, on the other hand, sparkled with excitement. Having grown up hearing stories of artifacts instead of fairy tales, her heart swelled with emotion.

Taking the cube from Shirone, she asked Canis.

"But what is this used for? No matter how I look at it, I can't figure out how to use it."

"I don't know the details either. Arin discovered it. Toss it here."

Tess carefully supported the cube and handed it over. But Canis, having apparently already experimented with it, threw it to Arin without any tension.

Watching how Arin handled the cube, Shirone realized she hadn't luckily figured out how to use it.

Most people, when first seeing an ancient artifact, would try to reason based on objects they knew. Shirone had also thought of cubes or bombs. But without the obsession with form, she was able to identify the peculiarities of objects.

Feeling the power of insight firsthand, Shirone listened carefully to Arin's explanation.

"I don't know why either, but when I press certain things, it activates. First like this here... then if I press this part, it seems to work."

Red light burst from the glass tube, dyeing the room crimson like blood. When Arin set it down on the floor, Amy covered her face with a pillow and screamed.

"What is it? Is it going to explode?"

How useful a pillow would be in preventing an explosion was questionable, but she seemed to have completed her preparations and peeked out from behind the pillow, waiting for a reaction.

The mechanical beeping accelerated, then turned into a tone as the red light disappeared.

Arin picked up the ancient artifact and pointed to the floor where the cube had been placed, continuing her explanation.

"This is spatial input. It remembers the place where the cube was positioned. Now let me try it again."

When she touched the cube, the glass tube now emitted blue light.

Arin looked around for a suitable spot and placed the ancient artifact near Shirone.

The glass tube changed to white light, and a massive black sphere was born in the air above the cube. A sphere of the same shape and size also floated at the location Arin had pointed to moments before.

"Huh, this is?"

Shirone was startled.

It was the black hole he had seen in the Labyrinth of Time and Space. The ability to compress and penetrate space. The goal this ability aimed for was clear.

"Now I understand. This is a portal. A portal that penetrates spacetime."

"Exactly right. It's a device called a Metagate. This device will become our secret weapon. First, let's demonstrate with Harvest."

Canis knew that no one would readily throw themselves into a black sphere. The lifeless Harvest was perfect for such experiments.

When Harvest put his hand into the black hole, a hand emerged from the other black hole.

Amy and Tess jumped onto the bed.

The distance between portals was three meters. Harvest was in a state of being split across both sides, separated by three meters. If they had experimented with a person, it would have created an even more bizarre scene.

"Heh heh heh, this is fun every time we do it."

"Harvest, it's dangerous. Come out now."

Arin said worriedly. According to their experiments, the portals lasted for one minute.

After Harvest withdrew and the portals disappeared, Canis picked up the cube again and spoke triumphantly.

"How about it? It's a warp device that remembers specific locations and connects spacetime. If we make it remember this location and then use it in heaven, we can return anytime."

As the impossible situation became possible, ripples spread through the hearts of Shirone's group.

Tess spoke in a voice trembling with emotion.

"This is... incredible, isn't it?"

An ancient artifact that could only be possessed by the great magician Arcane, because he had risked his life to visit heaven and return. That alone was sufficient for a national top secret.

What was even more amazing was that the seal was broken.

If the existence of this object became known to the world, diplomatic friction would certainly arise.

This wasn't on the level of the magic circle the Parrot Bandits had used.

What would happen if a single spy infiltrated the royal castle and activated the Metagate? Troops would pour in like a tide, and the kingdom would face the crisis of being overthrown. That's what ancient artifacts were.

Amy reached the same conclusion. Beyond its uses, even monetarily, its value was beyond imagination.

She didn't know how much inheritance Arcane had left to Canis, but there was no doubt that this single object would be worth several times that amount.

"Could we... sell this?"

She knew it was nonsense. But she was genuinely curious.

Honestly, she was dying of curiosity. 10 billion? 100 billion? If they could sell it, her 12th generation granddaughter would bow before Amy's portrait every night. She could understand why Canis had kept it secret.

Tess thought seriously about it. Like an appraiser, she rested her chin in her hand and examined the Metagate, then shook her head.

"Honestly, there's no one who could buy this. It would have to be at least a national level. Not just because of money, but because the repercussions would be enormous. Excluding nations, the most ideal buyer would be the Ivory Tower."

A magician residing in the Kingdom of Tormia couldn't be free from the Magic Association. And other countries had Magic Associations too.

But the Ivory Tower wasn't a place to approach with such concepts. They were those who pursued magic regardless of world affairs. They were a supranational organization, and their military power wouldn't lose even fighting the entire world.

"The Ivory Tower is called the world's pinnacle. I don't think even an ancient artifact would move them."

"From a magician's perspective, you might think so. After all, it's just an object. But the possibility is sufficient. Just look at the Ex Machina incident from 70 years ago."

"Ex Machina?"

"It's the name of an ancient weapon possessed by the nation of Cotria. I heard from my father that Cotria was doing relocation work to strengthen Ex Machina's security. It was a job to move it from its original location to a newly built bunker 30 meters away, but international society went into an uproar. The atmosphere was as if a world war would break out immediately. Do you understand what this means? All this happened just because an ancient weapon moved a mere 30 meters."

"Terrifying. What kind of weapon is it?"

"The Elzaine family also participated in intelligence warfare but learned nothing. We don't know what form it takes, how big it is, or even its activation principle. But judging from the reaction of neighboring countries at the time, it's likely a map weapon."

"Map weapon?"

"It means it's not a weapon used on-site. It got its name because it's decided by the highest leadership looking at maps. They say the seal hasn't been broken yet, but who knows. It's already been 70 years."

Map weapons lack humanity. Because nothing is marked on maps. They don't show who lives there, what culture they enjoy, or what must absolutely be protected. It was a world calculated only with triangular rulers, compasses, and pencils.

Canis had been listening to others appraise his possession.

He had no intention of selling his master's artifact. The reason for keeping quiet was to imprint his sacrifice. It was his will to want to go to heaven even while revealing an ancient artifact.

"Hmm, Ex Machina. And this is Metagate."

Shirone muttered, then stopped and looked at Canis.

"Wait, how do you know the name? You said Arcane erased the memories."

"It was written on a note. It was just an array of words. Even if we discovered the secret location, he made it so we couldn't infer what it contained. Such thoroughness was typical of our master."

"What else was written?"

"Nothing particularly significant. There was no explanation about heaven at all. He must not have wanted to reveal that much. But we can explore. Precisely because we have the Metagate. How about it? Would this be enough for a trade regarding the Immortal Function?"

There was room for consideration. The mere fact that heaven, which had only approached as fear, had changed into small excitement showed that. With Canis, the survival probability would dramatically increase. But... what would he gain?

"Why do you want to go to heaven? Just because Arcane went isn't convincing enough. And it's not like you have detailed information either. I think I need to hear your motivation for wanting to go to heaven before I can make a judgment."

Seeing Shirone thoroughly consider even the possibility of a trap gave Canis a sense of trust instead. If they had to depart for a dangerous place, traveling with Shirone would be several times more efficient than with a dim-witted magician.
