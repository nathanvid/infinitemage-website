"My master went to heaven approximately 80 years ago. Do you know what that means?"

"No, I don't."

"The master before going to heaven and the master who returned from heaven had completely different grades assigned by the Magic Association. In other words, he realized something in heaven and became a Great Magician. Every magician wants to become a Great Magician. Knowing this fact and still not going to heaven doesn't make sense."

Shirone had to admit it. If Arcane who returned from heaven became Grade 3, it meant something that awakened him existed in heaven.

Seeing Shirone waver, Canis revealed the last bit of information he had been holding back.

"Most of what was written on master's note were words, but at the end there was uniquely one complete sentence."

"What sentence?"

"It said this: That place is the origin of everything. The source of Schema and..."

Rian's eyes lit up.

"Schema?"

Canis ignored him and continued.

"Forgotten ancient magic..."

Amy asked back.

"Ancient magic?"

"The silent ancient weapons..."

Tess shouted.

"Ancient weapons!"

Canis frowned and said.

"...Are you guys doing this on purpose right now?"

"Hehe! Sorry. Hurry up and tell us."

Though Tess's teasing was annoying, Canis eventually recited the entire sentence.

"I leave this at this Metagate. That's what was written on the note."

It was a memo left so that people who didn't know about heaven's existence couldn't access the information.

A secret location that even Harvest, who inherited Arcane's memories, found only after wandering the continent. The fact that he maintained secrecy until the very end showed how much he wanted this fact to remain unknown.

Yet the reason he left such a record... it seemed like the inevitable mischievous nature of a rascal.

Though it was just one sentence, the note contained important information. First, heaven has Schema and magic. Therefore, there's a high probability that humans live there. Moreover, there would be ancient artifacts piled up like mountains.

Through writing, Arcane was saying this: Swordsmen and magicians of the world, beyond the Metagate, ancient artifacts are piled up like mountains.

Then what exactly are these ancient artifacts? No history book contains records about such artifacts.

Shirone grasped what kind of place heaven was.

"Ancient magic. Ancient artifacts. The origin of everything."

"Right. My master knew. Since when have humans learned Schema and cast magic? If it were a biological principle, Schema should manifest in animals too. But no matter how far back we trace history, there's nothing about the birth of Schema and Spirit Zone. Do you understand what this means?"

"Humans knew from the beginning. Though it's contradictory, you want to say this, right?"

"Exactly. More precisely, Schema and magic existed before humans did. Kadum called heaven his homeland. Though it's just mythology, from now on we must use mythology as our compass."

A pre-historical world awaits them. The origin of humanity that no scholar has been able to reveal might be hidden there. Somewhere among the immeasurable stars in the sky.

"I've told you everything I know. The conclusion is that I'm going there. Not only to carry on master's will, but also to further improve my magic. Arin and I have already reached an agreement about this. No matter what happens, there will be no resentment."

"I, I want to go too!"

Amy expressed her intention to join.

For a magician, opportunities to raise one's magical level don't come often. Also, the fact that Canis and Arin would become rivals at the same school played a part in moving her heart. No matter how dangerous a place it might be, wasn't there a Metagate? With a way to return available, not even attempting it would be foolish.

"If Amy goes, I want to go too! Shirone, let's go!"

Tess sided with Amy. With ownerless ancient weapons waiting, there was no reason not to go.

The Metagate alone would be tremendously valuable. Ancient weapons were objects made from metals that didn't exist in the world. Even picking up a single stone rolling on the street would make the trip worthwhile.

"No. I won't take anyone. I won't go either. It's too dangerous. Going to heaven doesn't seem like the right choice for us."

Everyone looked stunned at Shirone's words.

It was too precious to give up like this. This was an opportunity that would never come to any magician in the world. Hadn't Arcane also risen to the ranks of Great Magicians after gaining enlightenment in heaven?

"I know it's dangerous. But Canis has a way to return, doesn't he?"

"That's not the problem. Whether there's an exit or not doesn't matter. Just because I can open the gate to heaven doesn't mean I can put you all in danger."

Canis gritted his teeth.

He had known about Shirone's philanthropic spirit since he jumped off the cliff of an uncrossable bridge. That's why he had devised various strategies to bring the situation this far. But even this couldn't break his iron-willed stubbornness.

"If you're that scared, don't go. But we made a deal. You have to let Arin and me enter the gate to heaven."

"No. I won't send you either."

"You bastard! Are you betraying us now?"

"You can think that way if you want. But now you're also a classmate who entered our school. There's no way I can open the gate and send you to your death."

"Who asked you to worry about my life? I'll handle my own business! And we can come back anytime!"

Though Amy always respected Shirone's opinion, this time she sided with Canis.

"Right, Shirone. It's a good opportunity. And didn't you accept this level of danger from the beginning? You came all the way here to learn about the labyrinth."

Shirone's voice rose.

"Think about it from the opposite perspective. If you were in my position, could you suggest entering the gate to heaven? Could you suggest taking us to the star we just saw?"

'No, I couldn't do it even if I died.'

That was the problem. An issue separate from danger.

If Shirone had come alone, and if the current situation were available, he would enter heaven immediately.

But as an Unlocker, carrying his friends' lives and entering was a childish act. Shirone had the responsibility to make the most mature judgment among them, at least.

Lost in thought, Amy flicked Shirone's forehead. As Shirone grabbed his stinging forehead with a bewildered expression, she said.

"Of course I would suggest going to heaven. This is an opportunity like no other in the world."

Amy lied.

Worrying about a friend's safety was also a factor that hindered cool judgment. If so, she thought relieving the burden should come first.

But Shirone had already seen through it.

"Don't lie. This is really dangerous. Even with a Metagate, do you know where that place is? We won't just go and come right back. Why don't you understand that the greater the desire to go, the higher the danger level becomes?"

"Then why did you bring me all the way here?"

"What? That's..."

"You said it yourself, that you could feel at ease with me. That's why you came to my house, isn't it? Or what, were you planning to go sightseeing with a girl?"

Amy shot back aggressively. Whether it was effective, Shirone's words were blocked. Having brought graduating class students who couldn't spare a day to the island, he also had responsibility for that.

Tess beat her chest and supported Amy's opinion.

"Same for me. Even if you're the one opening the gate, whether I follow or not is entirely my will. You don't need to worry about that. Besides, if we're going anyway, Rian and I can be sufficient help to the fighting power."

Swordsmen were important in any party. They had the bravery and animal instincts that magicians didn't possess. The one second of opportunity they created would become the turning point between life and death for magicians.

When Shirone was conflicted, someone knocked on the door.

Canis hid the Metagate. But the owner of the knock didn't open the door until permission was granted.

When Shirone permitted entry, Mahatu came in. He was an uninvited guest, if anything.

As Shirone's group stared blankly, Mahatu hesitated before speaking.

"I'm sorry about this afternoon. I came to offer a formal apology."

"It's okay, I've forgotten all about it."

Of course Amy hadn't forgotten. But thinking that Mahatu's reason for visiting wasn't just an apology, she decided to let it pass.

As expected, Mahatu brought up the main point.

"Are you going to heaven?"

Shirone didn't answer. Though he had been swayed by his friends' strong persuasion, his thoughts still remained a question mark.

"Please don't go."

His friends' brows furrowed.

According to the chief, Shirone was the key holding the rise and fall of the Kergo tribe. It was unexpected that Mahatu, who knew this fact better than anyone, would try to stop him.

Canis, who thought Shirone had almost been convinced, spoke irritably as Mahatu interfered.

"What are you talking about? Don't go?"

"Excuse me for a moment."

Mahatu crossed both arms. As he inhaled, his muscles swelled and intense energy poured from his eyes.

It was overwhelming pressure.

Shirone's group felt the illusion of their bodies falling backward. Perhaps they actually were falling. If he had included killing intent, they wouldn't even have been able to breathe.

Mahatu, who hadn't intended to humiliate them, quickly released the pressure. But the air was still heavy.

"I apologize. I presumptuously showed off my crude skills."

No one thought Mahatu's apology was sincere.

Though there's nothing absolute about strength, there's clearly a boundary line between masters and novices. At Mahatu's level, he would know his own strength.

"I cannot go to heaven. Because I failed to prove my skills in the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice."

Shirone realized Mahatu's intention. He had informed them about heaven's difficulty level using his own power as a standard.

Though warriors and magicians couldn't be compared by the same criteria, it was sufficiently persuasive.

"Do Kergo people also take tests?"

"Of course. If they prove their strength in the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice, Kergo warriors are also given the qualification to go to heaven."

"But to go there..."

"Yes. An Unlocker is absolutely necessary. When the gate to heaven buried in volcanic ash was restored, countless people departed for heaven. But almost no one returned. That's why Miro created the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice to have skills verified. Of course, Unlockers are exceptions, but if you're not at a level to pass through skill, it's better not to go."

Not only the fact that almost no one returned was surprising, but also that Miro's name came from Mahatu's mouth.

"How do you know about Miro? Don't tell me you met her directly?"

"That's not the case. But most executives know about her."

"Could you tell us in detail? We came here to learn about Miro."

"I see, so that's what happened."

Mahatu realized why Shirone hadn't been swayed by gold coins or women. If he was connected to Miro, he would certainly be different from the dissolute Unlockers.

"500 years ago, the Kergo civil war broke out. It was a conflict between those who followed angels and those who opposed angels. The anti-angel faction won. But a sudden volcanic eruption drove the tribe to the brink of extinction. The angel faction interprets the volcanic eruption as a disaster sent by angels."

The scholars' view that Loop caused the civil war was wrong. Just the mention of the word "angels" showed this was a top-secret matter shared only by Kergo's leadership.

"250 years later, one outsider found this place. His name was McClain Guffin. He was an Unlocker like Shirone. He restored Kergo's ruins buried in volcanic ash and opened the gate to heaven. We call that gate the Gate of Guffin. But as a result, that incident caused another disturbance. The conflict from 250 years ago began to be stirred up again. This time the faction following angels won. The government changed. That's the current Kergo."
