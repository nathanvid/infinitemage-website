"The current leader of that faction is Chief Kadum."

Shirone recalled the two different gazes he had felt at the banquet. The elders who had welcomed the Unlocker would be the Angel faction, while those who had looked at him with displeasure would be the Anti-Angel faction.

By that classification, Hashid, the chief's father, was Anti-Angel. And so was Mahatu.

"Chief Kadum is leading Kergo to ruin. It may sound ridiculous coming from someone who smuggles Loops, but I believe we should never entrust the tribe's fate to God's messenger. Actually, I'm from Anti-Angel bloodline and was originally destined to become a slave. You must have heard about the human tourism that the Galliant autonomous government committed. Most of those sacrificed were Anti-Angels. My mother was also kidnapped by outsiders."

Amy decided to erase any lingering resentment toward Mahatu. If his parents had suffered such ordeals, it was understandable that he would express hostility toward outsiders.

"A hundred years ago, the Kergo tribe was shaken by the infiltration of civilization. When the Galliant autonomous government began human hunting, the Anti-Angels' rage intensified. It seemed like a third civil war would break out, and destruction appeared inevitable. But there was someone who reversed all of that. The person who ended the civil war by designing the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice to prevent reckless journeys to heaven. That person is Miro."

Shirone recalled Miro's appearance. He had sometimes felt unsettled by her eyes, which seemed to show severe emotional changes. But before entering Miro's Labyrinth of Time and Space, she had been a humane person.

"Actually, there are still conflicts even now. But it's much better compared to back then. Thanks to Miro. Without her, I too would have been nothing more than a slave."

"Where is Miro now?"

Shirone knew she was staying in the intermediate dimension of Estas. But at the same time, he thought she might exist everywhere.

"After designing the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice, Miro entered the Gate of Guffin. I wasn't there, but I heard she left word that she was going to meet Guffin."

Amy asked with a puzzled expression.

"Wait. Isn't Guffin from 250 years ago? How could she meet him?"

"I don't know that either. But that's definitely what was recorded."

Shirone thought it was entirely possible.

Installing the Gate of Guffin meant being an Unlocker who wielded Scale magic. If Miro was strong in spatial aspects, perhaps Guffin was oriented toward time?

He thought of Armin, the Eternal Reflector. He too had contemplated for over a hundred years using Stop magic, so it wouldn't be strange if Guffin was alive in some way. Even Great Magician Arcane had survived 150 years with biological abilities alone.

Canis wasn't interested in Miro. But the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice she designed was an important clue in determining the journey to heaven.

"Then where are the people who passed through Miro's Labyrinth of Time and Space waiting? Since Shirone has come, shouldn't those people go together too?"

Now that he heard it, Shirone was curious too.

The people who had proven their strength in Miro's Labyrinth of Time and Space. If they were still staying here, he could obtain more clues.

"While it's up to God's messenger to decide on companionship, there's currently no one here. The last team left for heaven two years ago and never returned."

Two years ago was shocking. People were heading to heaven more frequently than expected.

The reason Kadum had hidden this fact was because he was Angel faction. He hoped for more people to go to heaven.

Amy asked another question.

"All Kergo people believe in Ra, right? But how could a faction opposing angels arise?"

"Though I'm Anti-Angel, I don't know how the first civil war occurred. Most records were lost in the volcanic eruption 500 years ago. That's called the Lost Records. Honestly, we can't even know if the volcanic eruption was an angel's ability. Such stories are just being passed down."

Mahatu's story affected their judgment. Even if there was a way to return, it was a matter that required caution. They couldn't even get a sense of what kind of place heaven was.

"Even so, if you're going... I won't stop you. No, there's no way to stop you. But I want you to know this: everyone who has passed through Miro's Labyrinth of Time and Space so far was stronger than me."

Mahatu spoke indirectly, but ultimately he was saying they were stronger than Shirone's party. Even such people couldn't return from heaven.

In the heavy atmosphere, Shirone's party fell into thought. Mahatu realized his sincerity had been conveyed and bowed his head.

"I respect Shirone's will, which isn't swayed by offerings. You must have come with some purpose other than common worldly desires. That's why I thought I should tell you the facts. Whatever choice you make isn't my concern, but please judge carefully."

"Yes. I've heard important information. Thank you."

When Mahatu left the room, silence fell.

Heaven was still attractive, but no one tried to persuade Shirone.

Shirone's insight was correct. Only Shirone could decide, and the others had no choice but to follow.

"The headmaster... how much did he know?"

The person who came to mind at the end of his thoughts was Alpheas. Knowing that Shirone was an Unlocker, why had he told him about the Kergo Ruins?

"He probably knew about as much as we do, right? Miro was the headmaster's student. He must have heard about her activities."

"Then why did he give permission? What if the reality we're facing is happening beyond the headmaster's expectations? Then what choice should I make?"

"There's that problem too. I don't know how far he anticipated, but maybe he thought you wouldn't go to heaven? I would too. In the end, the problem is..."

Canis said while tossing his Metagate.

"I was the variable."

Alpheas hadn't anticipated Canis's existence. Even if he had, he never would have dreamed that Canis would find a route back.

Now all that remained was choice.

First, having an exit was positive. As long as it wasn't a world filled with toxic gas, they wouldn't die as soon as they arrived.

Thinking this way, not even attempting it seemed foolish. But since they couldn't know what variables human psychology might introduce, they couldn't overlook the worst-case scenario of missing the chance to return.

Shirone couldn't fall asleep until dawn.

The next morning, Shirone's party descended to the basement of the Temple. Chief Kadum led the way, followed by Hashid and Mahatu.

Amy thought this must be the secret space of the ruins that had been impossible to explore with Spirit Zone.

Upon reaching the lowest level, a passage with traces of volcanic eruption stretched straight ahead. Gems embedded along the walls guided the way.

Opening the iron door revealed a cavity. Priests stood along the walls, and in the center sat a single stone gate alone. The sight of a gate connected to nowhere made the existence of heaven undeniable.

Shirone arrived at the gate.

The Gate of Guffin. The entrance to heaven, reborn by the Unlocker McClain Guffin from 250 years ago. A red orb was embedded in it, with vertical cracks carved around it as the center.

Before coming here, they had finished their contract with Kadum. His request was simple: go to Ingris, the angels' library, and convey Chief Kadum's will.

The angels' library. Kadum said it wouldn't be difficult since it wasn't a journey to reach God, but the thought of gods and angels made it seem like an impossible mission.

Shirone met eyes with his friends. They would be able to return. Perhaps. Having decided to go, they had no choice but to think positively.

When Amy nodded, Shirone placed his hand on the orb at the center of the gate.

Taking a deep breath, the moment he opened Immortal Function, white light burst from the orb.

"Oh, oooooh!"

Voices of awe were heard. Even Mahatu, who was Anti-Angel, was kneeling and chanting Anke Ra.

Shirone concentrated his power further.

Unlike his initial thought, it wasn't a simple stone wall. The scratches on the gate that he had thought were traces of time began glowing red and revealed themselves as indecipherable magic characters.

As magic took effect, the stone wall began breaking apart into dice-sized cubes.

The pieces that had been disassembling regardless of gravity were crushed into powder-like fragments and finally absorbed into the light.

White radiance burst from the gate and swallowed Shirone.

"The Gate of Guffin has opened! Praise the angels!"

The priests prostrated themselves and chanted Anke Ra.

Shirone couldn't hear their voices. Enveloped in radiance, all he could hear was the sound of his heartbeat.

For the first time, he felt afraid. It was just one step, but an eternal distance. He didn't want to move.

A strong, warm hand touched his shoulder. It was Rian.

Right, he wasn't alone. Rian would never give up in any situation.

Tess's delicacy, Amy's cleverness, Canis's defense and Arin's mental strength. Even Harvest was now a reliable ally.

Wasn't this an excellent party? He felt a bit more relaxed.

Shirone stepped forward into the gate.

As Shirone's party left the altar, the white radiance gathered into gray particles and the stone wall began to restore itself.

The wandering cubes found their positions and finished assembly, and the magic characters lost their light.

Where the stone wall had closed, no one was standing.

The cavity was quiet.

Shirone gritted his teeth. Multicolored lights were racing around them.

What awaited at the end of this? No, was there even an end? The dizzying melody of light didn't disappear even when he closed his eyes.

As if they had become cannonballs shot from a barrel, their vision suddenly opened wide.

Everyone's feelings were the same. They could only hope it wasn't a world of burning sulfur.

The first impression wasn't bad. The air was clear and cool. But the moment they realized where they currently were, screams erupted.

How foolish to think they would emerge on land since the Gate of Guffin had been on the ground.

They were floating in the sky higher than clouds. At an altitude where they could see the ends of the ocean with their eyes.

The magicians attempted teleportation, but it was useless. Still under the influence of the Gate of Guffin, they fell toward the ground faster than free fall.

The ocean receded and dense forest came into view.

Shirone spotted a city standing in the center of the distant forest. It was identical to what he had seen in Miro's Labyrinth of Time and Space.

It was a castle surrounded by two concentric circles like ripples, with the area divided into six equal parts like pie slices based on the inner concentric circle.

In the sky above, machines resembling ladybugs were flying around. He briefly thought they looked like human brains.

As their altitude decreased, even the city disappeared from view, and they finally crashed into the forest. Breaking through the canopy, they could see the ground. They would die instantly if they hit like this.

They tried magic but it was impossible. Only when the pebbles rolling on the ground were about to touch their retinas did the Gate of Guffin release them.

**Forest of the Profane (1)**

Heaven's outskirts. Purgatory.

Without time to survey his surroundings, Shirone clutched his head first. Having fallen headfirst, his head should have been shattered normally.

He seemed to have lost consciousness for a brief moment, but when he came to, he was standing on both feet on the ground without any injuries.

Tess examined herself here and there and said.

"Are we alive? Or are we dead?"

"We seem to be alive? I'm hungry, so."

Though Rian's words about being hungry in such a situation showed his boldness, in reality he was trying hard to reassure Tess.

"Maybe we didn't fall from the sky."

Shirone explained using his expertise.

"So it was like spatial movement. We simply came here through a tunnel, and we saw various scenery as space folded."

Ultimately, it was spatial movement. However, it was a strange phenomenon that appeared because the distance moved transcended common sense.
