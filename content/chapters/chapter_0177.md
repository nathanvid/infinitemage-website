The group looked around their surroundings. Trees with long leaves blocked out the sky above.

From above, it seemed like there would be no gaps, but light managed to squeeze through the slightest cracks to illuminate the world. Moss and mushrooms grew in the shade, and the earth felt damp with moisture.

Even so, it didn't feel similar to their original world.

The secret behind the feeling that time had stopped lay in the size of the rocks.

The age of a space can be determined by the weathering of rocks. However, the rocks here were all different sizes. There were small pebbles, but there were also countless boulders as large as houses. This would be impossible unless someone had moved them there.

"The materials might be different from where we lived. For instance, they might have durability that prevents them from being worn down even as time passes."

Canis's words made sense.

Ancient artifacts were made from minerals that didn't exist in the original world. And the fact that they were ancient artifacts meant they were objects from before recorded history. If this was heaven, then rocks that had endured for eons would be living proof.

"So this really is heaven?"

"Let's check the Spirit Zone first."

At Amy's words, each person tested whether they could cast magic. The Spirit Zone was a realm of omnipotence, but there was an uneasy feeling that omniscience might be disrupted in a world physically separated from their own.

Fortunately, magic was working normally.

"So this is heaven after all? Well, now that we've had a good look around, shall we head back?"

Everyone stared at Tess. Not expecting to receive such attention, she gave an awkward smile and waved her hands.

"Ahaha, no, it's just a joke."

"Actually, I was seriously considering it too."

If Rian was saying such things, one could imagine how tense the others were feeling.

As if to prove this fact, Shirone's group hadn't moved a single step from where they had arrived.

Shirone took a small but momentous step forward and spoke.

"Let's move for now. Whether we fell from the sky or space warped, we saw a city, didn't we? We just need to walk in that direction. At least it means there's civilization there."

Where there was civilization, there were laws. Of course, whether those laws aligned with common sense was unknown, but it was a more realistic decision than spending the night in a forest where anything could emerge.

"But how do we find the city? We don't know which direction to go."

"I can handle that."

Amy's pupils turned red. Reading the information stored in her self-image memory, she pointed toward where Rian was standing.

"Based on direction, the city should be that way."

Amy's self-image memory could perfectly reconstruct specific moments in time. This remained true even after flying astronomical distances.

This was based on the fact that her ability wasn't mathematical. Just as a compass points north regardless of space, she too possessed a kind of magnet that could maintain its center regardless of any variables.

Following Amy, the group didn't miss any sounds from the scenery around them. They could hear insects and birdsong, but strangely, nothing was visible.

Realizing this was a phenomenon they shouldn't overlook, they stopped walking when they heard the sound of grass rustling in the forest.

Tess, with her sharp senses, drew her sabre and spun around. Rian stood beside her with his hand gripping the hilt of his great sword.

"What is it, Tess?"

"I don't know. It sounds like someone is approaching."

Amy asked with a tense expression.

"Are you sure it's someone? Not something?"

Tess couldn't answer. The breathing sounded similar to that of a human, but she couldn't be certain.

There was no guarantee that people lived in this place to begin with.

In a situation where some unknown monster could emerge, the group's tension reached its limit.

*Swish! Swish! Swish!*

The sound of vegetation rustling came closer and faster. Tess was certain that whatever it was, it was targeting this location as it approached.

The magicians entered their Spirit Zones, and Rian drew his great sword and let it hang down. Whatever it was, he planned to strike the moment it emerged from the forest.

Taking deep breaths as he waited for his opponent, Rian wore a puzzled expression.

Based on the frequency of the sounds, it should have arrived by now. But there was still only the rustling noise; the opponent had yet to reveal itself.

"Rian, it might be better to step back."

Tess's voice trembled.

In her mind, there was only one possible explanation. The sound was coming from much farther away than expected.

As Rian maintained his stance ready to strike and took a step backward, the ground shook with *thud! thud!*

Finally, parting the undergrowth, the creature revealed itself.

"What, what is that?"

Shirone looked upward. His neck craned back as far as it could go.

It was a giant.

An eight-meter-tall giant, to be precise. It was naked except for scraps of cloth draped here and there.

Its beard reached down to its chest, and its face was grotesquely wrinkled. In contrast, its body was as robust as a young man's.

Tess examined the groin area with the strategic judgment of looking for weak spots. It was smooth. The face looked masculine and there was no protruding chest, but no reproductive organs were attached.

"Um... we have a bit of a bad situation here."

Arin spoke. Tess, who had left the giant's reconnaissance to Rian, turned around and asked.

"What's wrong? Is it worse than our current situation?"

"I don't know which situation is worse, but this is my first time experiencing something like this."

Shirone also turned to look at Arin. What did her insight see when looking at the current giant?

"I can't read its emotions. Whether it's angry, laughing, or sad. Everything is jumbled together."

The most shocked person was Canis. Even Harvest, materialized behind him, tilted its head as it examined the giant.

"Arin... can't read emotions?"

That couldn't be right. Theoretically, it was impossible.

The ability of insight brought the characteristics of all things in the world to an equal level.

Even if emotions were blocked like with Sakiri from the Magic Association, she should at least be able to see that kind of insight.

The fact that she couldn't read the giant's emotions was definitely strange.

"Those who come to Purgatory... those who deny God..."

They couldn't understand the giant's words. It didn't seem likely they could find a translator either. The only person the group could rely on was Arin.

But she shook her head again.

"I don't know. I can't decode it."

Not only insight but even telepathy didn't work. Arin was no different from being blind. Since she couldn't even read the opponent's expression, she borrowed Canis's eyes.

"Canis, do you think that giant has hostile intentions?"

"It seems like it, I think."

Could it be that Arin, who specialized in mental resonance, couldn't even detect killing intent? Even with the Metagate, the reason they had stepped into this unknown world was because they trusted Arin's ability to neutralize experience.

Without Arin, it was impossible. Amy seemed to have the same thought, leaving the final judgment to her.

"Arin, what should we do now?"

"What do you mean what should we do? We obviously have to run!"

When Arin hurriedly ran away, Amy was dumbfounded.

Canis chased after her, and the others began retreating as well.

Amy, who had the slowest reaction, looked back at the giant. It was pursuing them while holding up a nearly two-meter-tall sapling it had uprooted.

"Graaaaaah!"

The giant's roar was equivalent to a sonic cannon. In her dazed state, Amy belatedly threw herself forward.

The roots of the sapling the giant swung brushed against her collar.

"Since it's so big, it won't be able to follow us! We have to run for now!"

"You should have said that sooner!"

Amy, who had caught up to Arin using Schema, shouted. Fortunately, she had safely avoided the strike, but if her reaction had been even slightly delayed, her back would have been split open.

"Sorry! I didn't know this would happen either."

Arin didn't avoid responsibility.

Since they had entered heaven, they were one team. As someone who wasn't a combat magician, her contribution to the party was to discern the enemy's nature, objectively analyze the situation, and relay it to the leader. Now that this function was paralyzed, all she could do was apologize.

Since they were bound by a common fate, no one blamed Arin. However, they were worried about what lay ahead.

Arin's mental-type abilities were an enormous asset. It was too early to jump to conclusions based on it not working on just one giant, but it was true that their journey had gotten tangled from the very start.

At the sound of the ground shaking, Shirone looked back. The thought that something big would be slow was a misjudgment. The giant had caught up to within striking distance.

Tess's voice came through Arin's mental channel.

*—Shirone, give us directions. Can't we just escape using teleportation?*

*—That's dangerous. We still don't know where this place is. If we encounter greater danger, that's where we'll be annihilated.*

*—But we can't keep running forever, right? Honestly, I can't even see what's around us right now.*

*—...That's true. Then let's fight here. It seems like taking down the giant should come first.*

When Shirone chose the combat route, Rian and Tess spun around and lunged toward the giant.

With Shirone at the center, Amy and Canis took positions to his left and right, while Arin provided support from the rear.

Rian, befitting a front-line knight, attempted the first attack.

Fighting an eight-meter-tall enemy involved many unpredictable variables. It was difficult to predict attacks coming from overhead, and conversely, the only areas they could target were below the knees at best.

Rian aimed for the Achilles tendon.

The moment the great sword was swung, the giant swung its tree trunk. When the weapons collided at the midpoint, the tree trunk was sliced as if torn apart.

It couldn't be called a clean cut. The giant's strength was so overwhelming that its own weapon had been destroyed.

From the single collision, Rian was sent flying three meters. He barely managed to land, but even then, both legs dragged against the ground.

Feeling spasms in his right arm, he gripped the blade of his great sword with his left hand and took a combat stance.

The giant's strength was tremendous. But what was more surprising was how fast it was.

"How is this possible? It defies the laws of physics."

For an eight-meter-tall creature to support its body, it would need hundreds of times more muscle strength than a human.

Just standing was remarkable enough, yet its combat movements were comparable to those of a beast of prey.

"Heretics... shall be executed!"

Spitting out incomprehensible words, the giant hurled the broken sapling at Tess.

The moment the one-meter-long sapling embedded itself in the ground, Tess kicked off and soared into the air.

The giant, which had been in a throwing stance, followed up by punching downward. There seemed to be no way for Tess, suspended in mid-air, to avoid it.

At that moment, her body flew forward as if ignoring inertia and landed on the giant's fist.

It was external gravity.

Charging along the giant's forearm, she slashed its left eye with her sabre and leaped down. As the giant covered its eye and lifted its upper body, she shouted to her companions.

"Now!"

Shirone fired a Photon Cannon. Considering the monster's size, this wasn't a situation to conserve mental power.

Light comparable to the size of a cannonball struck the giant's abdomen directly.

As if embracing the Photon Cannon, the giant's body curved and both legs lifted off the ground.

The sight of the giant being pushed back was hard to believe even seeing it with their own eyes. Canis, who had been hit by the same technique before, squinted as he felt phantom pain.

Shirone's group thought this was the end. However, the giant's legs, which had been horizontal to the ground, came down and pressed against the earth with its soles, coming to a stop.

Everyone was speechless.

It had taken a Photon Cannon with its body. Wasn't this the same magic that had achieved destructive power approaching 5,000 in the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice? While an iron door might be one thing, it was absurd for a creature made of blood and flesh to withstand it.

"My God... how can it be fine after taking that hit?"

The giant's expression was twisted. Its face, with wrinkles now more pronounced, was frighteningly grotesque.

At that moment, Amy's fireball flew from the side and set the giant's face ablaze.

Amy's judgment was effective. Fire was the natural enemy of cells. No matter how strong its muscles were, burning it would do the trick.

The giant, with even its beard on fire, clutched its face and staggered.

Confirming the giant's face trapped in flames sent chills down their spines. New skin was regenerating inside the melting and dripping skin.

Tess muttered in disbelief.

"That's Schema, isn't it? How can a giant use Schema?"
