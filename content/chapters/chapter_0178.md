Arin cast her power of darkness. Now that the giant was wounded, this was the perfect opportunity to test whether her abilities would work.

The power of darkness that Arin wielded took the form of shadows that branched out like plants. The branches that burrowed into the giant's shadow climbed up like vines and grabbed its ankles.

Arin cast Mental Shock, a mental attack spell.

If telepathy was like a thief, then Mental Shock was like a robber. While creating trauma might be pushing it, she could easily inflict shocks equivalent to phobias.

The true strength of Mental Shock was that it could chain into Mind Control.

Mind Control, which had also been Arcane's specialty, was magic that controlled an opponent's body, but it was difficult to succeed with.

To approach a 100% success rate required concentration equivalent to twenty times the opponent's mental strength.

In essence, you couldn't dominate an opponent stronger than yourself.

However, strategy and tactics sometimes made such things possible—specifically when Mental Shock succeeded.

If she could dominate the giant with Mind Control, there would be nothing to fear in this forest. Knowing this fact, Canis also made no particular response and watched for the result.

Mental Shock failed.

The giant with its face on fire began charging at the group with even more violent movements.

Arin bit her lip. Telepathy, Mental Shock, Mind Control—the three sacred treasures of mental magic had no effect on the giant.

For someone of Insight level, this was her first experience with such powerlessness. Her delicate emotions flared up.

'Why? Why isn't it working? It's just a big human, isn't it?'

"Arin! Get back!"

Canis blocked for Arin while casting Shadow Wall.

The moment the shadow rose, the giant's fist smashed into it. The darkness of the Shadow Wall scattered like powder. The impact had exceeded the magic's absorption capacity.

But the giant seemed to have lost strength as well, unable to push forward any further.

Harvest climbed up the giant's forearm and slashed with her claws at areas where blood vessels would likely pass.

Her calculation that it would be similar to human anatomy if it had mastered Schema proved correct.

A fountain of blood gushed forth as blood vessels in the elbow joint were severed. However, the wound healed quickly. Rather, as if stimulated by the pain, it began thrashing about wildly.

'It's really strong. To think such a creature exists in this world.'

When Shirone used Teleportation to lure the giant, Rian slashed at the giant's heel like gutting a fish.

Canis cast his power of darkness. The serrated shadows were specialized for attack, but even while wrapped around the ankle, they couldn't cut through the muscle.

Canis, who could only immobilize the giant, shouted.

"Incredible strength! Try something fast!"

Amy's Flame Strike bombarded the giant's face. But adding fire to something already burning wouldn't change anything. While wind power was added, its physical force was weaker than Photon Cannon when compared purely in terms of impact.

Shirone compressed photons. Unlike what everyone thought would be Photon Cannon, the activation time was longer than expected.

Canis, noticing the mass of light distorting softly, burst out in irritation.

"Damn it! What are you doing? Focus!"

"No, that's not it."

Arin spoke up.

"He's changing the form of the photons."

Since they couldn't defeat it with physical force, he was converting to cutting power. If neither heat nor impact worked, then he needed to create sharpness.

It was the right judgment for the current situation.

But Canis wondered if it was possible. Changing the form of light was beyond common sense.

Shirone felt it too. Artificially suppressing light that wanted to be released was difficult work. He thought it might be possible by creating differences in the direction of force compressing the photons, but the mental consumption was absurdly high.

A groan leaked through his teeth. As he tightened his wavering mind with Diamond Body and increased his concentration intensity, the photons flattened.

The Photon Cannon, transformed into a disc shape, rushed toward the giant.

The giant, having broken free from the power of darkness through sheer force, twisted its waist. As the blade of light sliced past its side, the wound opened a span wide and blood gushed out like a waterfall.

It was a critical hit, regardless.

Realizing this fact, the party—both swordsmen and mages—rolled their eyes back and charged in.

They stabbed with sabers and pummeled with great swords. They burned with flames and cut with shadow saws, doing everything they could until the giant's body toppled backward.

The attacks continued, but it felt like dismantling a dragon with just hand knives. Even a single muscle fiber had the strength of steel.

Amy gasped for breath as she spoke.

"Hah, hah. It's dead, right? It must be dead, right? Right?"

"I don't know. Probably dead. If you're worried, should we do it once more?"

Tess shuddered.

"No, I can't do any more. There's a limit to cruelty."

"I tried to cut its neck with the power of darkness, but it really won't cut. How about peeling off the flesh first?"

Canis's words seemed to be the final blow, as everyone backed away with drained faces. In any case, the giant showed no signs of movement, and since the wound Shirone had inflicted wasn't regenerating either, leaving it alone was the best policy.

Tess gave Shirone a thumbs up.

"That was cool, Shirone. Another new magic this time?"

"I was lucky. If the giant had dodged, there wouldn't have been a second chance. Just thinking about it is terrifying."

Canis was displeased. Photon Cannon was impact-focused magic. But changing its form to convert it to cutting power? The idea itself was impressive, but as a dark mage, he couldn't help but feel like his rice bowl was being stolen.

"Hmph, we won so it worked out, but it was basically gambling. As long as we move as a team, individual mental strength converges to the party's mental strength. If you had failed, you would have been combat-incapacitated. In a situation where even a mage's body could serve as a shield, breaking formation is dangerous."

"I know. I was flustered too because the efficiency was worse than I thought."

Canis snorted and turned away. He had lashed out, but the insight to change course in that situation was definitely talent.

Arin seemed to share the same thought, watching Shirone rest through Insight before speaking.

"I felt it before too, but that boy's thinking is really free."

It was gambling, but gambling with high odds.

The insight to choose what to give up and what not to give up to reach victory. If even one or two out of ten choices had been wrong, they wouldn't have reached the current result.

"Tch, he was always quick-thinking anyway."

Canis added a comment. Either way, they were a team now, and denying what should be acknowledged was a product of inferiority complex.

"Grrrr..."

When the giant made a groaning sound, Shirone's party's hearts sank. There were no signs of it getting up yet, but they could see its fingers moving slightly.

Without needing to exchange opinions, they ran into the forest.

They still didn't know what kind of world heaven was, but they had no intention of fighting giants ever again.

@

With Amy's Insight, Tess's senses, and Arin's ability to distinguish between natural and unnatural things all combined, they could find their way without any particular crisis.

The place they arrived at was a rocky cliff area.

The abundance of shadows pleased Canis and Arin. While Shirone's magic wasn't affected by the environment, dark magic was maximized in darkness.

"We can feel safe here. If push comes to shove, I can move with Darkport."

"But Darkport can't transport multiple people, can it?"

Dark magic didn't have theory for transferring effects like photonization magic. Therefore, it was impossible for anyone other than dark mages to travel through shadows.

Canis shrugged as if it was no big deal.

"At least it'll help tactically. Here I can lure enemies by myself."

Tess spoke while receiving the water bottle that was being passed around in turns.

"A giant using Schema. Isn't this place too dangerous? And it's also unsettling that Arin's mental magic was useless."

"I'm sorry. I wasn't helpful."

When Arin lowered her head, Tess waved both hands.

"No, no. I couldn't handle the giant either. Anyway, we won. The important thing is that we all worked together to win. Come to think of it, heaven isn't much either, hohoho!"

Tess lightened the mood, but the mages' faces darkened instead.

Unlike swordsmen who had improvisation ingrained in their bodies, mages disliked unexpected situations. They could only feel at ease when they controlled and ultimately dominated all variables.

Magic that transformed the form of photons wasn't on the list of strategies for party operation.

Knowing that variable upon variable ultimately led to total annihilation, they weren't happy about a victory achieved by relying on individual inspiration.

"In the previous battle, we didn't perfectly control the situation. It's a bit awkward to say this right after arriving, but I think we need to consider whether to return at this point. What do others think?"

When Shirone broached the topic, Amy spoke up.

"I think it was pretty good for a first time. We don't need to overlook the fact that we won, do we? What I mean is, Shirone found a solution anyway, and that solution has potential to be applied to various situations going forward. Therefore, even if we encounter the same enemy, we can avoid a situation like this one."

Amy's opinion also had merit.

Of course, Canis was on the side of not returning. But he wasn't foolish enough to give false opinions out of greed.

"It's not such a simple problem. Shirone probably won't use that strategy from before again. Right?"

"That's right. It's too dangerous. The time to compress photons and the efficiency drops too. I don't think I'd attempt it unless it was quite an emergency."

"The idea was plausible. If you can give mass to photons, light also becomes closer to matter, so transformation of form becomes possible—that's what you were thinking, right?"

The reason Canis could read Shirone's thoughts was because the method he had tried was the exclusive domain of dark magic.

"But it's a misjudgment. Mental crafting is incompatible with you. It's a characteristic of dark magic. Dark magic has less impact force, but demonstrates engineering power through form transformation. In my case, it's serrated shapes, in Arin's case, it's tree vines."

Arin demonstrated with her power of darkness. The shadow that rose from the ground changed into the form of an intricate apple tree. Additionally, she adjusted the size to reveal even three-dimensional beauty.

When Shirone expressed admiration, Arin smiled and explained.

"Mages use the Four-Way Formula, but dark magic is specialized in mental crafting, so it doesn't need a separate Four-Way Formula. We call this modeling. Elements with good stability like ice or darkness make sculpting easy, while fire or light are too active, making modeling difficult."

Amy agreed.

"Now that I think about it, I'm like that too. I can't control the form of flames. That's why I incorporate Air-type attributes to cast magic."

"Right. But light is more difficult than flame. No, theoretically modeling is impossible. You can add light's characteristics to other attributes, but you can't add other attributes to light. Of course, Shirone made it possible with divine particles, but that's just a special case. Thanks to that, he succeeded in some degree of modeling, but even that is pushing it for practical use."

Shirone sighed and spoke.

"Then how should we fight giants in the future? Laser might be possible, but considering the giant's movements, it won't be easy."

Laser could destroy matter regardless of durability, but because it took time to accumulate energy, it was less effective against fast-moving targets.

It was fortunate that it was magic that didn't exist in the world, because if Harvest had known the characteristics of laser beforehand, she wouldn't have been caught so easily like last time.

"The problem is that the only enemy we've encountered is one giant. How strong are giants in this world? If we could just know that, wouldn't it help with exploration?"
