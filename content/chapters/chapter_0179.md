At Rian's observation, Shirone snapped his fingers.

"That's right. Let's think about this. The existence of living creatures means they feed, and when you consider it that way, the ecosystem's food chain forms a pyramid. If we extract only the distribution of predators and create statistics, wouldn't it look something like this?"

Shirone drew a pyramid with curves as pronounced as a woman's body.

It showed a structure where a small number of mutant predators were interspersed between lower predators, intermediate predators, and apex predators.

Since only carnivores were represented, the bottom and middle tiers showed equal distribution.

"What are these mutant predators here?"

"Among predators, there are many species that don't obtain food through hunting. Some might use traps, or there could be creatures that feed based on intellectual abilities. Like monkeys in our world."

"I see. Then where would the giants be positioned?"

"Since the gravity is similar and there's air, they probably don't deviate much from biological characteristics. If we assume that, they'd be around hereâ€”between intermediate and apex predators."

"Ho, giants are mutant predators? Even though they're so strong?"

"Well, they might be apex predators. If so, there's hope for us, but their combat style is too primitive, wouldn't you say? Even cats have refined hunting methods. But pulling up trees and swinging them around doesn't seem like it would help much with hunting. That's why I classified them as mutant predators."

Tess tilted her head and asked, "Couldn't they be mutants between lower and intermediate predators? Wouldn't that be a problem? It would mean most predators in this forest are stronger than the giants."

"I don't think so. They seemed to use language. If they have even a little intelligence, they can't be below intermediate predators."

Canis said, "I see. Then we can consider the giant we first encountered to be in the top 30 percent or so. Of course, there's a chance it belongs to a different distribution."

"Statistically, yes. In any case, their numbers won't be large. From a sensory calculation, the probability of encountering an enemy stronger than a giant seems to be less than 10 percent."

Amy, who had summarized the situation, reached a conclusion.

"Then there's no problem, right? If six of us fight together, it's not an opponent we can't handle. No one's injured either."

Shirone carefully analyzed the situation.

Looking at it positively, Amy was right. But in matters of life and death, probability was nothing more than a mirage.

The fact that less than an hour had passed since arriving in heaven seemed to prevent them from turning back. It was just a baseless delusion, but everyone probably understood that much anyway.

In the end, they didn't want to return yet. Even if greater danger than now were to befall them.

"All right, let's at least go to the castle walls. I don't want to give up here either."

Just as they shouldered their backpacks and prepared to depart, an explosive sound came from the forest.

Tess's hearing detected a woman's voice.

An unease flashed through her that this might be a more dangerous situation than a giant's attack. But if it really was a woman, that meant an intelligent being. The information they could learn from her would be nearly infinite.

Looking at each other and exchanging intentions, Shirone's group plunged into the forest as if by agreement.

Kiiing! Kick! Kick!

The six-legged unicorn beast let out rough cries.

The unicorn beast, belonging to the crustacean family, was a creature that moved by driving its six triangular, pointed legs into the ground. Its pale purple body was surrounded by a shell, with a single large eye embedded in the center of its face. The long horn growing from its forehead looked longer and sturdier than even a unicorn's horn.

"Rena! Drive it this way!"

"Got it! Be careful, sister!"

Kanya and Rena surrounded the unicorn beast from front and back.

The woman with black hair flowing to her waist was Kanya, and the child with large, pretty eyes was her younger sister Rena.

They were of the Mecca race, citizens of heaven, whose slender jawlines, small noses, and crescent moon-thin lips boasted youthful appearances compared to other races.

Their ages were seventeen and fourteen, but looking at their faces alone, one couldn't tell who was younger.

Rena, who had subdued the unicorn beast's rear, swung her sword aiming for its blind spot. The blade, with numerous lines intersecting at right angles, showed tremendous effectiveness befitting a weapon made through complex assembly methods.

When she struck the unicorn beast's back plate, an impact wave burst with a bang, scattering shell fragments.

The unicorn beast, having received its third attack, let out its characteristic shriek and moved sideways. Rena launched her body accordingly.

Though the unicorn beast's single eye could survey a 330-degree radius, Rena maintained the only 30-degree blind spot and struck the shell again.

When the excited unicorn beast turned and charged, she thrust out the kite shield-shaped shield on her wrist.

Though it was a toy-like small shield, when the horn collided with it, a phantom shield several times larger appeared and pushed the unicorn beast back.

The overturned unicorn beast flailed its multiple legs like a beetle. It barely managed to find its center and stand up, but still reeling from the impact, it kept staggering to the right.

Kanya aimed her Arc.

Though similar in form to a bow, it was made of iron and had no bowstring. Instead, there was a handle to pull, and when drawn, red light shot from both ends of the bow, targeting the unicorn beast.

It was a weapon that could aim at targets through triangulation.

As long as the zero was set, the projectile would never miss. Kanya aligned the red dot where the red lights converged with the unicorn beast's face.

Sensing danger, the unicorn beast moved left and right despite its dizziness. Kanya twisted her waist to match the unicorn beast's movements.

When Rena disappeared into the blind spot again, the terrified unicorn beast leaped toward Kanya.

Kanya aimed at the unicorn beast's single eye and released the handle. The wire quickly wound up, and a small orb shot out from the center of the Arc.

The orb that penetrated the unicorn beast's eye caused an explosion inside. The unicorn beast's body shuddered with a thud, then collapsed to the ground.

Its organs must have melted, but it was still screaming horrifically.

Rena held her sword in reverse grip and stabbed between the shell gaps. With a pop sound, the unicorn beast's body jumped up as if salt had been sprinkled on it. Then it never moved again.

Having finished the battle, Kanya lowered her Arc and wiped her sweat.

"Phew, that was tough. This one was pretty tenacious, wasn't it?"

"Yeah. Are you okay, sister?"

"As you can see, I'm perfectly fine. But this is strange. Why did a unicorn beast appear? It should be far from their habitat."

"Could we have gotten lost?"

"Impossible. The drone is pointing in the exact direction. Maybe the forest's laws have changed. Let's get out of here quickly."

"But we should take the elixir. There might be one inside."

Rena climbed onto the unicorn beast's body. She opened the shell and thrust her hand inside, finding the melted organs warm like porridge.

It was a disgusting texture, but Rena boldly stuck out her tongue and stirred around until she caught something.

After searching for a while, her eyes filled with delight.

"Huh? There is one! Sister, there is!"

A red-glowing orb emerged from the unicorn beast's body.

"Yay! It's a Red Elixir. Thank you, unicorn beast."

Seeing her sister hopping around, Kanya smiled warmly.

Most species among Purgatory's creatures cultivate elixirs within their bodies. While not particularly necessary for the divine citizens under God's protection, it was the most important substance in Purgatory.

"We were lucky. Now, let's go quickly."

Just as she returned to being a stern older sister and urged her younger sister on, Kanya turned around at a strange energy that sent chills down her spine.

Eyes embedded in the forest flashed with killing intent.

Shortly after, they revealed themselves, tapping the rocky terrain with pointed legs.

Unicorn beasts. Seven of them, no less.

"Rena! Come here!"

Kanya pulled her sister close and took a combat stance. Yet questions wouldn't leave her mind.

It was impossible for unicorn beasts to appear in groups so far from their habitat.

'Damn. I let my guard down. I should have kept checking the drone.'

Though Purgatory was called hell on earth, God's will still extended over this place. Of course, since they were irrational monsters, the laws acted like instincts. This meant some event that could change their instincts had occurred nearby.

"Of all times, now...!"

Changes in the forest's laws were rare. And divine citizens rarely left heaven to come to Purgatory.

The fact that two statistically unlikely events had occurred simultaneously made her heart even more anxious.

"Sister, what do we do? There are too many unicorn beasts..."

One unicorn beast could be handled by one Mecca. But for two, more than five Mecca were needed.

According to the laws, the Mecca race's specialty was group combat based on technology.

Though they had the weakest physical abilities among divine citizens, when they formed groups, even the Kergo or Nor races couldn't ignore them.

This was why Kanya trembled with fear. Even with an Arc, defeating seven unicorn beasts was impossible.

What on earth was happening in the forest?

Despite checking routes for a whole year to avoid monsters, everything had come to nothing.

Kiiing! Kick! Kick!

As the unicorn beasts threatened by shaking their horns, the sisters stood back-to-back, protecting each other's rear.

One unicorn beast that had been approaching cautiously leaped at Rena.

When she thrust out her Mecca shield, the Exd, powerful repulsion bounced the unicorn beast away.

Kanya, who had switched positions with Rena, fired her Arc. Since precise aiming was impossible in this situation, the projectile struck the unicorn beast's shell and caused an explosion.

As the unicorn beast rolled on the ground from the impact, the remaining ones attacked.

"Sister! Hide behind me!"

Rena switched positions again and thrust out her Exd. Every time the unicorn beasts' horns touched the shield, it sounded like thunder.

She even swung her shock wave weapon, the Signa, but unless attacking from blind spots, unicorn beasts were difficult monsters to hit.

The time she could hold out with the Exd was gradually decreasing. When the repulsion exceeded its limit, the shield's function stopped, becoming an ordinary toy.

As seven unicorn beasts coordinated attacks from all directions, Kanya and Rena embraced each other and closed their eyes.

More than the fear of death, they feared the pain before dying.

Unicorn beasts stuck their snouts into living humans' bellies and sucked out their organs. Kanya wondered if she should steal Rena's Signa right now and cut her throat.

Just as the seven unicorn beasts were about to pierce the sisters' bodies with their horns, light flashed from the sky and lightning descended.

In Kanya and Rena's eyes appeared the back of a boy. He was blonde and wore strange clothes unseen in this world.

Shirone cast Photon Cannon immediately upon landing.

A curtain of light swept back and forth in a radius between 3 and 5 meters, bouncing away all the unicorn beasts.

As the ground sank in a circular depression, the two women sat down hard. Yet their gazes remained fixed on Shirone. They had never heard of people living in the Forest of the Profane.

"Are you okay?"

Shirone turned his head with a smile.

Meeting people in a world where you couldn't return home even if you ran for a lifetime brought joy incomparable to homesickness. Whatever the identity of these two women, the disgusting monsters were enemies and humans felt like allies.

At the boy's appearance, Kanya heightened her guard. Conversely, Rena, a pubescent girl, blushed.

'He's handsome. Is he a Nor?'

While the two women entertained different thoughts, Shirone's group was fiercely battling the unicorn beasts.

Rian and Tess each took on one beast.

After exchanging one blow, Rian felt considerably relieved. Though not an easy opponent, this level of strength was something he had encountered quite often as monsters in the original world.

Grabbing the unicorn beast's horn and bending it back with brute force, the precarious six legs flipped over with a thud.

Rian thrust his straight sword into its abdomen, pinning it to the ground.
