Tess's battle was also nearing its end.

Though the lightweight saber couldn't break through the unicorn beast's carapace, it was perfectly optimized for targeting gaps. After stabbing between the gaps in the shell to reduce its mobility, Tess delivered the finishing blow by driving her saber into its single eye. She then twisted the blade and brought the unicorn beast to its knees beneath her feet.

Seeing the battle dragging on, Amy cast Fire Wall around the perimeter.

Since these were mindless beasts, the best outcome would have been for them to flee, but contrary to expectations, one of them broke through the fire barrier.

Harvest, having enlarged his frame, grabbed the unicorn beast's torso and snapped its spine.

Arin was relieved to discover that insight worked on them. When she cast Mind Control on four unicorn beasts, two of them began trembling violently.

The two unicorn beasts caught in Mind Control turned around and began stabbing their allies.

With the monsters fighting each other, the party no longer needed to battle.

Rian and Tess, having finished off their unicorn beasts, sheathed their weapons and returned to Shirone.

When Amy released Fire Wall, the unicorn beasts' bloody battle came into view. They were using their horns, legs, and even snouts to stab, topple, and trample each other.

Since the numbers were equal two against two, Arin's skill at controlling the unicorn beasts was crucial. Though she initially struggled to adapt to these unfamiliar creatures, she quickly grasped their characteristics and attempted divide-and-conquer tactics using their long-range horns.

The party watching this fratricidal tragedy felt chills run down their spines.

This was particularly shocking for Kanya and Rena. Beings that followed the law were now breaking the law and killing their own kind. Today was a day when many things were happening in the Forest of the Profane.

Arin, victorious in battle, let out a deep breath.

Mind Control itself continuously drained mental strength, and when forcing combat, the fighting spirit of the dominated creatures also flowed into her, causing considerable mental fatigue.

The unicorn beast under Arin's control turned to look toward Shirone. Kanya and Rena hastily stepped back, but the creatures merely assumed submissive postures.

Arin pondered how to deal with the remaining unicorn beasts.

The tremendous success rate of Mind Control through insight was Arin's unique strength, but it could also be a weakness. High emotional synchronization meant receiving the opponent's feelings more vividly.

This could be called a fateful suffering for all mental-type magicians who dealt with the minds of the world.

Arin hesitated as usual. Even if they were monsters, cruelly ending the lives of beings that had fought for her was a painful task.

Tess, who claimed to be second to none in tenderness of heart, spoke for Arin's feelings.

"Can't we just take them with us? Having just two would be incredibly reassuring."

"No. We can't waste mental strength on monsters of this level. Now that we know insight works on them, Arin should focus on that. She needs to maintain the mental channel at all times too."

"Hmm, what about releasing them?"

"They'd just come back to attack us. Worst case, they'd bring other groups."

"I see. Then unfortunately, we have no choice but to kill them. Couldn't we make them fight each other to death?"

At Tess's words—Tess who claimed to be second to none in tenderness of heart—Arin bit her lip.

This was different from controlling unicorn beasts to kill other unicorn beasts. With her already high synchronization rate plus the added emotions of allies who had fought together, her internal conflict deepened further.

Rian gripped the handle of his greatsword and said, "Then I'll kill them. Just hold them still."

Canis shook his head.

"No, this is something Arin has to do. To reach high levels as a mental-type magician, she can't remain weak forever."

There were limits to standing out with insight abilities alone. To reach her target destination, situations like this shouldn't pose a problem.

Canis hoped Arin would stay by their side for a long time.

"Arin, you promised when you were taken by the Magic Association. Our master is no longer in this world. We need to become stronger. This place isn't leisurely enough to show mercy."

Arin closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Canis was right. Would she rely on insight or would she dominate insight? It was difficult, but it was a problem she had to overcome at least once.

Arin made the unicorn beasts walk to the forest's border. Then she made them stab each other's eyes with their horns.

The two unicorn beasts fell facing each other.

They were still breathing but could no longer move, and there was no other way to deliver a fatal blow.

Arin forced a smile.

Watching this, Harvest recalled when he had faced her through the glass tube.

Though she was still considered fragile for a magician, compared to when she feared everything in the world, she had become a completely different person.

"It's both Arin's strength and weakness. She easily resonates with others' minds, but that's why she can't become ruthless. Arcane always regretted this about her."

"But now she's changing. Arin will be able to handle things well."

Shirone, who had been sharing Arin's sadness, felt relieved hearing the conversation between Harvest and Canis. Though she had chosen a difficult profession, she had lifelong companions to be with her.

"Anyway..."

As Shirone turned around with a leading tone, his friends also turned their gaze to Kanya and Rena.

The two women flinched in surprise. Waves of emotion unsuited to the situation were rippling in the eyes of all six people.

"They're human."

"Yes, they're human. They have swords and shields too."

"Ah, swords and shields. I thought I'd go crazy wanting to see those. The thought of talking to a giant who uproots trees and swings them around was dizzying."

As incomprehensible words continued, Kanya blocked her sister and shouted, "What are you saying? Who exactly are you people?"

Arin connected Spirit Zone to attempt telepathy. When Kanya's thoughts were transmitted, Arin materialized them through insight and conveyed them to Shirone's party.

Shirone spoke as amicably as possible.

"Uh, so we came from somewhere else..."

Sharp eyes stopped Shirone mid-sentence.

As words that had been incomprehensible suddenly became understandable, Kanya's tension heightened. Most importantly, the lip movements and language weren't matching.

"What did you do? Is this magic too? Are you Nor race?"

"Nor race? What's that?"

Instead of answering, Kanya extended her right arm. A drone flew down from the sky. The beetle-like mechanical device landed on her wrist, then separated like steps and attached as a gauntlet.

"Language analysis."

Light came on in the back part of the gauntlet.

"Say something again."

"What do you mean?"

That was enough. Kanya bent her arm to check the gauntlet.

No data. Analysis impossible.

After confirming the drone's information, she drew her Arc. Pulling the handle, a red dot appeared on Shirone's forehead.

"Wh-what are you doing? All of a sudden."

Having watched from the forest, Shirone knew how powerful the Arc was.

Being treated this way without even knowing why was bewildering. This was definitely not the reaction that should come when humans met each other in a place where monsters lived.

"Rena! These things aren't citizens! We have to fight!"

"B-but sister... they're still our lifesavers."

"Now I understand. Why the unicorn beasts are here. Those things have disturbed the forest's law."

Hearing this, Rena couldn't help but move. Though reluctance showed on her face, she still took a fighting stance holding Signa and Exd.

"You'd better tell the truth if you don't want your head blown off by the Arc. What exactly have you done in this forest? Who exactly are you?"

Even if asked who they were, there was no way to explain. Frustrated, Shirone could only shout, "We're human too!"

"How can I believe that? You don't speak the citizens' language! But you're not heretics either!"

"Anyway, we can communicate. Isn't that enough?"

Kanya frowned. Strangely, Shirone's words had a persuasive quality.

"So let's resolve this through dialogue. If we can communicate, we should at least be able to find a more peaceful method than pointing that strange weapon at us."

"Peace? Speaking of peace in the Forest of the Profane. You're really suspicious."

"Forest of the Profane?"

"I guess that's the name of this forest."

With Arin's explanation, silence fell.

The standoff continued for a while.

If Shirone put his mind to it, subduing her wouldn't be a problem, but he absolutely didn't want to fight.

She was human. They could communicate. If only she would let go of her hostility, they could hear detailed explanations about this world.

At that moment, Rena looked up at the sky.

A drone patrolling the area projected onto her retina the scene occurring 500 meters away. Over twenty unicorn beasts were approaching.

"Sister, this is bad. Unicorn beasts."

Only then did Kanya come to her senses. With the forest's law disrupted, staying long would be tantamount to suicide.

The strangers of unknown identity also seemed unwilling to fight. Though she couldn't be certain, with the skill to defeat unicorn beasts, they could easily have subdued her.

"Follow me for now. Let's get out of here first, then talk."

Kanya returned the gauntlet on her arm to insect form and sent it flying into the sky. After confirming the unicorn beasts' location, she determined the direction and entered the forest.

Shirone's party followed her without complaint. Amy mentioned they were heading away from the city.

**Reversal of Law (1)**

Kanya led them into a valley mixed with jungle and rocky terrain.

Surrounded by cliffs with only the sky visible above, Shirone walking through the bottom of the V-shaped valley could guess how long this world had existed.

As they walked, they exchanged names with Kanya's group.

Though Kanya still couldn't trust them, she seemed to accept that they at least had no intention of fighting.

"This is Spiral Snake Valley. The law is different here, so there shouldn't be any danger."

"The most dangerous thing would be Shirone getting hit by that strange weapon."

At Rian's joke, Kanya's eyes sharpened. She seemed to be bothered by what happened in the forest, but if she had to pick who was more frustrated, it would be herself.

Guessing that Shirone was the leader, she pointed at him and asked, "What exactly are you people? Does coming from another world even make sense?"

"But it's the truth. Believe it or not, that's the only way we can explain it. Now you explain. What kind of place is this world? Like that giant we took down earlier."

"Giant? Did you just say giant?"

"Yes, giant."

"So you're saying you killed a giant!"

"No, we didn't kill it. What happened was..."

Before Shirone could finish speaking, Kanya grabbed his collar and shouted, "How could you kill a giant, you idiot! Giants are law-keepers! So it was you after all. You killed the giant and that's why the unicorn beasts ran wild!"

Amy brushed off Kanya's hand. Though she'd been suppressing her temper to gather information, she couldn't tolerate someone treating her friend roughly.

"We said we didn't kill it! And the giant attacked first!"

"Of course it did! We're the ones who broke the law! The Forest of the Profane is a place humans aren't supposed to enter!"

Shirone stepped between the two growling women.

"Even if you say that, we don't know what you mean. Understand? We really did come from somewhere else."

Kanya was stunned. Nothing Shirone said could convince her, but that's exactly why it had to be true.

"You guys... did you really come from somewhere else?"

"That's what we've been saying all along."

"No, I don't mean it that way, um..."

Kanya's expression turned serious.

Though it was just a story she'd heard as a child, it definitely existed—humans from the earthly kingdom under heaven's rule.

They were descendants of citizens but pitiful beings who couldn't feel God's presence. Therefore, they couldn't enjoy eternal life and struggled in mortal suffering until their lifespan ended.
