"Alright, I'll explain. This place is called the Outer Hell. It's also known as Purgatory."

"Purgatory? This is?"

"Yes, the prison of the earth. It's where heretics who rejected the law live. Now I understand. You people denied the existence of God in the land of earth. That's why you fell here."

Shirone didn't correct her misunderstanding. Even if he explained, she wouldn't understand, and it wasn't entirely wrong either. None of his companions believed in Ankera.

"Seeing that you use magic, you must be descendants of the Nor race, but what a pity. Since you've fallen to Purgatory, all that remains for you is death. You'll die eventually."

"Right, we'll die eventually. But so will you."

Kanya lifted her chin with a somewhat proud expression.

"Not at all. I'm a divine citizen chosen by God. That's why I'm guaranteed eternal life."

Shirone recalled the myths of Kergo. If someone could grant eternal life, they could certainly be called a god.

But it didn't feel realistic.

Living beings age and must inevitably die someday. Preventing death was impossible even with the power of magic.

Realizing the identity of Shirone's group, Kanya felt much more at ease. She disliked heretics, but these were pitiful souls who hadn't even received the chance to accept God's divine power.

"It can't be helped. You're lucky. Follow me. I'll introduce you to a place to stay."

"Why are you suddenly being nice to us? If you're a divine citizen and we're heretics, shouldn't you think badly of us instead?"

Kanya turned around, knowing no one was following.

"You're suspicious, which confirms you're descendants of the Nor race. In heaven, I would have driven you out, but it's fine here. In Purgatory, no law can protect divine citizens. You and I are in the same situation. Anyway, we need to hurry. It becomes dangerous when the sun sets."

The deeper they went into the valley, the higher the cliffs soared. It was a desolate place where not even a single flying insect existed. A bit of moisture and echoes. Only their footsteps could be heard in the vast nature.

"Don't tell me another strange thing is going to appear?"

"Don't worry. The Valley of the Whirlpool Serpent is a place where one powerful law exists, so dangerous magical beasts like the unicorn beast don't live here."

"What kind of law?"

"The Whirlpool Serpent. It's a magical beast known to have lived here for over ten thousand years. But it's probably sleeping now. It doesn't move around during the day. That's why I said we need to hurry. We must reach the Nor Shelter before the sun sets."

"You said we're descendants of the Nor earlier, right? Then aren't the Nor divine citizens?"

"Of course they're divine citizens."

"Then why is there a Nor Shelter in Purgatory?"

Kanya felt frustrated but recalled where they came from and added an explanation.

"There are three races of divine citizens residing in heaven. The Nor people are one of them. Divine citizens have their lifespans determined from birth, and when their lifespan ends, they gain eternal life. But some of the Nor people couldn't accept that, it seems. So they escaped to Purgatory and created an independent society."

Shirone couldn't understand the part about lifespans being determined from birth, but he let it pass for now. At least it wasn't as strange as gaining eternal life.

More than that, he was grateful for Kanya's consideration. Because she thought Shirone was a descendant of the Nor people, she was guiding them to Nor society.

"Thank you, Kanya. You're kind."

"What are you talking about! There are no divine citizens who are kind to heretics. We're only going because we need something anyway, so don't get the wrong idea. When we arrive at the Nor Shelter, don't even pretend to know us from then on."

Despite her cold words, she couldn't look Shirone in the eyes.

Seeing Kanya's pretense, Rena puffed her cheeks and added a word.

"That's right. Sister is really going because she needs something. But I'm going because I sincerely want to help."

"Haha! Yes, thank you. Rena is thoughtful."

At Shirone's praise, Rena's cheeks turned red.

Kanya stopped walking. It was understandable to be attracted to foreigners at such a sensitive age, but as a divine citizen under the rule of law, it was something she shouldn't think.

She grabbed Rena's wrist and dragged her to where the cliff was. While Shirone's group watched in bewilderment, she scolded in a whispered voice.

"Rena, what's wrong with you? You know too, that we can never be connected with heretics. Even harboring such feelings is sacrilege."

"I know too. But that brother is..."

"If it's not allowed, then it's not! No matter how immature you are, being handsome isn't everything. If you choose men that way, you'll be in big trouble."

"How would you know? You don't have a boyfriend either, sister."

"You'll understand when you grow up. Anyway, listen to your sister, okay? From now on, be cold to that man."

"I don't like brother Shirone because he's handsome, but because he's kind."

"Kind? That kid?"

Kanya looked at Rena with a bewildered expression. How should she interpret her sister's words?

He was certainly a unique boy. But the reason she felt that way was also because he was a heretic. Free-spiritedness leads to corruption. In that sense, associating with Shirone was dangerous.

"Tell me clearly. Do you like handsome people, or do you like kind people?"

Rena was fourteen, old enough to feel romantic emotions. She, who would soon have to play the role of mother, felt the need to change her sister's way of thinking.

"Of course both. They have to be handsome, but also kind."

"Whew, I really don't understand you sometimes."

"It's okay, sister. I won't fall in love with someone I've only seen for one day. And... anyway, we're no different from those people right now."

Divine citizens entering and leaving Purgatory without permission was a violation of the law. They might be punished, but it was still something they couldn't give up.

However, she regretted bringing her sister along.

No matter how much longer Rena's lifespan was than her own, it was an irresponsible decision as an older sister.

"I'm sorry, Rena. I..."

"I know, sister. Besides, I insisted on coming. You don't have to take on all the dangerous work alone. I really want to give mother a gift too."

Kanya stroked Rena. The child who used to cry for milk had already grown this much. She hoped Rena would receive God's grace and enjoy eternal life.

Because she was a lovable child, surely Ra would make it so.

"Alright, I understand. Let's hurry."

The valley was now becoming maze-like. Shallow water flowed through narrow branching paths, making even the air humid.

Amy used her Insight to notice that Kanya's movement pattern was all over the place.

It was the typical movement pattern of someone who was lost.

"It's quite far. Is the Nor Shelter still distant?"

"We're not going there. We don't know where the Nor Shelter is either."

"What? You said earlier we were going to the Nor Shelter."

"That's our destination. There's no way we divine citizens would know where the Nor people who escaped from heaven built their place."

Feeling Amy's bewildered gaze, Kanya added more words.

"Don't worry. There's still a way."

"What way?"

"Using drones. The Nor Shelter is an open market that anyone can go to. A guide dispatched from the market is waiting in the Valley of the Whirlpool Serpent. We just need to find that person. That's why we're currently searching for places where people might stay with drones."

Shirone looked up at two drones flying through the sky.

Those flying objects would also be called ancient artifacts in the original world. But they were only ancient in name; their technology was incomparably advanced.

He suddenly became curious about what expression Nade would make if he showed them to him.

"I understand those machines are scouting, but how can we see what they see?"

Kanya poked her temple and said.

"They're connected to my head. It's called frequency."

"Frequency?"

"Um, so it's like an invisible signal. Similar concept to sound, I guess? It's a technology called retinal vision. When the drone shoots radio waves to my frequency, an image forms in my eyeball. Look closely at my left eye."

An electric field-like aura appeared in Kanya's pupil, and a bird's-eye view of the valley rapidly unfolded. Despite being smaller than the pupil, the resolution was high enough to confirm what scenery was spreading out.

"This is the valley observed from the drone's viewpoint looking down. You can't see it in detail, but it actually takes up half my field of vision. Since it's an image directly formed on the retina."

"What amazing technology."

Tess couldn't hide her envious feelings. She was already obsessed with ancient artifacts, but especially drones were items that could change the paradigm of espionage.

"Where can you get something like this?"

"This isn't something you get, but something supplied. It's an item only given to the Mecca race, and you can receive a drone when you turn twelve."

"Then could you get one and give it to me?"

"No. The quantity is thoroughly managed, so if you're caught secretly taking one out, you'll receive severe punishment."

"I see. I'd like to have one too..."

"Drones are what other divine citizens envy too. But they have personal encryption anyway, so other people can't use them. When the owner changes, an alarm immediately sounds and it goes to sleep."

Tess was even more upset that it was an item for only one person. She wanted it. But if it was something supplied by the state, it couldn't be bought with money either.

Jealous Tess kept her mouth shut from then on.

"I found a place where Nor people might stay. It's not far from here."

Kanya started running from then and arrived in front of a cave.

The drone landed on the back of Kanya's hand and transformed into a gauntlet.

The scenery of the final capture point appeared on the surface. Comparing what she saw with her eyes to the photo, Kanya said this was definitely the place and approached the cave.

At that moment, Tess raised her hand to stop her.

"Wait a moment. I smell blood."

"Blood smell? I don't smell anything."

"Hehe, of course. I've been training since childhood. That machine can't smell either, can it?"

"What are you talking about? Mecca race technology can distinguish 140,000 different scents. It's just that drones don't have that function."

The group finally realized there had been an unspoken rivalry between Tess and the drone.

Indeed, the drone's reconnaissance ability was outstanding even by their standards. But Rian just thought Tess was pathetic for feeling jealous of a mere lump of metal.

"That's enough, so hurry up and do it. Don't feel inferior to strange things."

When Rian called it a strange thing, Tess felt better and used her sensory Schema to track the lingering scent of blood.

Taking one step into the cave and examining the interior, she looked around outside for quite a while.

After finishing her analysis, she turned to the group and said.

"There's a blood smell coming from inside the cave. Someone is definitely there, but it seems they haven't come out of the cave."

"Why? Doesn't it smell like blood outside?"

"No. Rather, I'm speculating they haven't come out because the blood smell is strong from inside."

"But you spent more time checking outside?"

"It's a kind of manual. If there's also a blood smell outside, there's a high probability the cave is a trap."

"Then at least it's not a trap. Let's go in."

Shirone cast the illumination magic Shining.

As a sphere of light rose above his palm, Kanya and Rena were shocked. Although the Nor people were a race that handled magic, they had never seen such magic in heaven.

"Sister, do you see that? He created light from his body."

"Yes. People from the land of earth use strange magic."

"Yes. But that... doesn't it look just like that thing?"

"Rena! Such thoughts are sacrilege. Quickly apologize in your heart for being wrong."

Rena's expression became sullen. Since her sister noticed without saying anything, it meant she had the same thought too.

Anyway, sacrilege was sinful, so she asked Ra for forgiveness in her heart.
