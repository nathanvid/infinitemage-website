After advancing ten meters, the smell of blood became even stronger.

Just as Tess, tension rising, was about to suggest they slow down to Shirone—

Suddenly the cave shook, and blunt pillars burst out from the walls. Not only were they fast, but their size was enough to crush a human to death.

Shirone's group reflexively retreated.

Looking from a distance, it was even more bizarre. Dozens of pillars that had jutted out from the cave walls were crisscrossed together.

"Is everyone okay? Anyone hurt?"

When Shirone shouted, Amy's response came back.

"Yeah. I don't think so. What about you, Shirone?"

"I'm fine too. Don't tell me it was a trap?"

"No. There are no signs of artificial modification in the cave. Besides, for a trap, it triggered way too early."

Tess was right. If they really wanted to kill them, they would have lured them to an inescapable point before activating the trap. But the pillars jutted out from the front, as if their purpose was to prevent approach.

"If it's not a trap, then what is it?"

A boy's voice came from the end of the cave.

"Reveal yourselves! I won't miss this time!"

Shirone held out his Shining to illuminate the interior.

A boy who appeared to be around the same age was crouched down with both hands pressed against the ground. Behind him sat a sturdy-looking bearded man with his legs stretched out, blood visible through the gaps between his fingers covering his stomach.

It was Gadrak, a guide from the Nor's Shelter.

Gadrak, who had been examining Shirone's group, spoke to his disciple.

"Clove, didn't I tell you not to use earth magic in caves? If even the ceiling collapses, we'll die too."

Hearing his master's words, Clove slowly stood up. Even so, the wariness in his eyes didn't disappear.

Shirone felt a familiar sensation from their conversation, as if he had come to the original world. Although he couldn't understand the Nor race's language, the pronunciation and intonation were similar to the continental common language.

Kanya approached them and spoke in the Nor race's language.

"You're Nor people, right? We've been searching for you."

"Oh? Now that I look, you're distinguished divine citizens. So what business do the Mecca race, who terribly hate exploration and adventure, have coming all the way here?"

"Well, naturally to get to the Nor's Shelter..."

Kanya stopped mid-sentence and examined Gadrak's condition. His mouth was smiling, but his complexion was pale.

Blood was flowing from his stomach.

It was strange. What could there be to get injured by in the Valley of the Whirlpool Snake where only one law exists?

"Are you hurt? Don't tell me the whirlpool snake..."

"No, it's not the law. I was attacked by Kergo."

The word Kergo pierced the ears of Shirone's group. At first they thought they had misheard, but as Kanya brought the Nor race's language to the surface, their conversation began to be interpreted.

"Kergo? You mean those things came hunting all the way here?"

"There are no heretics living here, so there's nothing to hunt. They must have deliberately targeted us. Fortunately I avoided fatal wounds, but if the bleeding continues, who knows what will happen."

Shirone interjected into their conversation.

"Did you just say Kergo? What did they do?"

"Kergo is also one of the divine citizen races. The Valley of the Whirlpool Snake is a safe place because no demons live there, but for that very reason it's a route frequently used by heretics trying to reach the Nor's Shelter. In such places, there are always other hunters."

"So in the end, the Kergo people hunt heretics."

"They'll probably catch up soon. They have good tracking abilities. On top of that, they use giant techniques. Finding this place by smell like Tess did is no problem for them either."

Shirone guessed that the giant techniques were Schema. In that case, this wasn't the time to be standing around talking.

Arin attempted telepathy directly with the Nor people.

"Can you take us to the Nor's Shelter?"

Gadrak and Clove's expressions changed to bewilderment. Even though it was clearly an incomprehensible language, they were automatically understanding the meaning.

"What are these kids? Is it a fairy's ability?"

"No, they're people from the land country. They use magic like you do. Actually, it might be somewhat different, but anyway they seem to be descendants of the Nor race."

Kanya packaged things so that the Nor people would accept Shirone's group as warmly as possible. To survive even a little longer in Purgatory, entering the Nor community was the best option.

"What, so you're saying they're imitations?"

Clove's gaze toward Shirone's group turned disgusted.

The Nor people were curious and therefore the race that broke laws the most even in heaven. Consequently, they knew more forbidden secrets than the Mecca race.

The same was true regarding the land country.

The land country was said to be a shadow that imitated the sky country, which was a perfect world. Therefore, the humans living there were nothing more than imitations created by copying the humans of heaven.

In Clove's mind, Shirone's group were beings inferior to anything in heaven. The gap between Nor people and imitations was as great as the difference between creator and created.

"We're imitations? What's that?"

Ignoring Shirone's words, Clove pointed to the backpacks lined up along the wall.

"Hey, you guys. Come here and carry the luggage first. One each."

There was no need to use insight. Clove's tone contained contemptuous emotion. Amy, angered by his arrogant posture with chin raised, snapped back.

"Why should we carry your luggage?"

"Isn't it obvious? We need to run away."

"So why do we have to carry that luggage?"

"Because you're imitations. If we didn't exist, you wouldn't exist either, right? You should naturally follow with gratitude."

Clove seemed to accept as a given fact that Shirone's group should obey orders.

Even while doing so, he flared his nostrils as if challenging them and fingered Amy's hair.

"Not bad for an imitation. How about coming to my house? Don't you want to live safely in Purgatory?"

Amy's eyes sharpened.

Divine citizens, imitations—such matters were part of this place's way of thinking, so she could overlook them. But the act of putting hands on a woman's body was just having a rotten personality, regardless of heaven.

"Take your hands off. I can blow you away."

"Haha! You, me? Well, since you're an imitation, you can use some magic. But it won't work on me."

"Stop it, Clove."

Sensing anger in his master's voice, Clove stepped back.

Only then did he feel the atmosphere of this place. Shirone's group was glaring with murderous intent in their eyes.

"What? What are you going to do by staring at me?"

"Clove, there's no time. Are you going to let me die here?"

Realizing his master's injury, Clove hurriedly supported Gadrak. Then Gadrak, leaning on his disciple's shoulder as he stood up, apologized on Clove's behalf.

"Sorry about that. Even I'm seeing imitations for the first time, so there seemed to be problems with how to respond. In any case, you're human too, right? I'm Gadrak. It looks like we need to leave this place, so won't you help us? You seem to have come looking for the Nor's Shelter too. We'll guide you."

Gadrak was more like a mage should be. Apologizing in front of his disciple wasn't easy, but he understood that whether they were imitations or whatever, cooperation was important for survival.

Shirone's group also judged it dangerous to stay long, so they shouldered the backpacks without complaint.

They arrived at the place where Clove's pillars were tangled together.

Clove, who was supporting Gadrak, had to break out in a cold sweat for quite a while trying to get through.

Amy snorted with derision. It was amusing to see him caught by magic he had cast himself, but seeing that he hadn't even anticipated something like this made her think his head might be a bit lacking.

Shirone wasn't paying attention to Clove but was thinking about the magic he had cast.

The magic that made pillars emerge from walls was intense yet dynamic. But he felt it would be extremely inefficient to execute this using methods he knew.

Perhaps the mechanism of ancient magic was different. Thinking this, Shirone asked Gadrak.

"But what is this magic?"

Clove burst into contemptuous laughter and intercepted the answer.

"Haha! What, you guys can't do it? This is ridiculous. Earth magic is the most basic of basics."

Saying this, he winked at Amy.

"I could teach you if it's you."

"No thanks. I don't want to make my friends suffer."

At the sarcastic reference to the earlier situation, Clove's face reddened.

Gadrak was equally curious about Shirone's magic. He was an imitation who used peculiar magic.

From what he knew, the sphere of light Shirone was floating in his hand was magic impossible to implement in this place. The cave was a domain of darkness.

It would be different if he had contracted with a light spirit, but seeing that it had no activity, that wasn't the case either.

"Hmm, it's difficult to explain. Don't you use this kind of magic?"

"We have magic using earth attributes, but there's no magic that makes pillars burst from caves."

"The principles might be different. We use magic by borrowing the power that dwells in nature. Fire magic where there's fire, water magic where there's water. The reason Clove used earth magic is the same. Though it seems he didn't think about the risk of collapse."

"No, master. I was really desperate then."

Clove made excuses, but Shirone's group wasn't even listening anyway. They were too busy having a conversation through mental channels to pay attention to other people's nonsense.

—Magic using nature's power. Quite peculiar.

—The destructive power was considerable too. The magic that guy Clove cast would be quite difficult in the original world. Yet he did it easily. Even though he's such an idiot.

Amy added to Canis's words.

—The advantage of borrowing nature's power isn't just firepower. One person can handle multiple schools. It's different from us who decide on majors and train.

Arin pointed out the disadvantages.

—But there seems to be an aspect where adaptability is reduced. You're constrained by the environment. If the desired attribute isn't around, you can't cast magic.

To summarize the characteristics of ancient magic: it was wide-ranging, powerful, and could utilize various attributes. On the other hand, environmental constraints were severe, and in some cases there was potential for magic itself to be sealed.

Heaven's magic and earth's magic—which was more efficient was still a question that couldn't be hastily decided.

Having exited the cave, Kanya looked back at Gadrak and asked.

"But where is the Nor's Shelter?"

"I can't tell that to the Mecca race. Just know that it's at least not here. We need to go by magic, but it's impossible here. Follow me."

At that moment, Rena, having received a drone signal, checked her retinal vision and shouted.

"Sister! Big trouble!"

Kanya also closed one eye and received information transmitted by the drone. In a valley not far away, a group was approaching at high speed.

"Oh no, it's the Kergo people! We need to go quickly!"

A light of resignation appeared in Gadrak's eyes.

"No good. It's already too late. Their sense of smell is incredibly keen. They caught the scent of blood."

No sound of approach could be heard yet. Nevertheless, having caught the scent of blood meant that at least one member of the group was a master of the sensory arts.

"What do we do? What should we do, master?"

Clove stamped his feet as he asked.

Gadrak couldn't possibly have a clever plan.

According to Rena, the number of pursuers was roughly twenty. Gadrak was in an injured state and Clove lacked practical experience. If a collision occurred like this, it would be total annihilation.

"What if we do this?"

Everyone's attention focused on Shirone.

@

The Kergo pursuit party riding black horses galloped over the stream.

Their eyes, clad in red armor reflecting the sun, flashed like famous swords just drawn from a forge.

The pursuit party's captain, arriving at the cave, raised his hand to halt their advance.

"Stop! They're inside the cave!"

Twenty subordinates stopped, led by the captain. A woman with a ponytail hanging down drove her horse next to the captain.
