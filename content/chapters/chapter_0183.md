"Should I go in?"

"No. The Norse use nature affinity abilities. They're at a disadvantage in narrow spaces. They know this too, which is why they're luring us in."

The captain used his Schema abilities to shout so his voice echoed through the cave.

"Come out right now or you'll face terrible consequences! I'll count to three!"

His subordinates drew their bows and nocked arrows.

Though not explosive arrows like Arc projectiles, arrows fired with Schema strength could pierce through even rocks. Anyone inside the cave would be riddled with holes without a chance to dodge.

"One!"

The cave remained silent.

"Two!"

The captain's expression twisted. Had they decided to die?

The only method available to the Norse was to use earth magic to block the cave entrance. But such a stopgap measure wouldn't last long, and it would eliminate their own escape route.

"Three!"

A red dot appeared between the captain's brows.

When something shot out from the cave, the captain drew his sword with superhuman reflexes to shield his face.

But by the time he realized what he had blocked, the projectile was already exploding.

"Damn it...!"

A fireball engulfed the captain with a thunderous roar.

The flames reached even his subordinates, and the startled horses reared wildly.

At that moment, Shirone's group emerged from the cave.

The captain, having fallen from his horse, glared at them with his smoke-rising body. Planting his sword in the ground as he stood up, he looked around at his disrupted formation and shouted.

"They're with the Mecca race! Don't let them escape!"

Since they had been pursuing Norse, they never dreamed the Mecca race would be there.

Shirone had aimed for that blind spot.

His prediction was correct. Kanya and Rena had waited through their drones for the pursuit team to approach, firing Arc at the precise timing to create an escape opportunity.

"There are many enemies! Find us a narrow path!"

At Shirone's words, Kanya checked the terrain with her drone and changed direction.

The pursuit team, having grasped their strategy, fired arrows.

Even shot directly from 100 meters away, the arrows didn't lose speed and whizzed past Shirone's group.

Clove turned around in annoyance.

"I'll buy us time!"

"No! Just keep running!"

"I need to pay them back at least once to preserve Norse pride!"

Clove dipped his hand in the shallow water and cast the ancient magic Shaving.

The stream water began freezing and turning white.

Crackle!

The sound of water solidifying spread through the valley, and pillars similar to those seen in the cave rose up from the frozen surface.

Even while running, Shirone watched the spectacle.

The scale of ancient magic that borrowed nature's power was far greater than expected. The stream had frozen solid, and countless pillars blocked the view enough to prevent horses from advancing.

A crashing sound of breaking ice was heard.

The group's faces turned pale. The pursuit team had abandoned their horses and were smashing through the ice pillars with swords and fists as they charged forward.

"Have Norse and Mecca joined hands? How fitting for inferior heretics!"

Kanya aimed Arc while shouting.

"We are divine subjects! There's no reason for you, who are also divine subjects, to interfere with the law!"

As soon as she released the handle, Arc's projectile rushed forward.

A warrior with a longsword sliced the projectile in half. Shortly after, two fireballs exploded behind him.

"Those who break the law shall be executed! We are the First Divine Subjects chosen by god!"

The Kergo pursuit team roared as they raised their weapons.

This was completely different from the Kergo civilization seen in the original world. Luxurious armor and extravagant accessories. They were nobles of the divine subject realm.

Shirone, running alongside Kanya, asked.

"Why are they acting like this? If you're all the same divine subjects, why fight so viciously?"

"It's heretic hunting. Among divine subjects, they're the most devout race. As such, they're arrogant and hostile toward other divine subjects. Nothing good comes from getting entangled with them."

Shirone closed his mouth. They were already thoroughly entangled.

"They're annoying, but they're strong because they use giant abilities. Purgatory is an extraterritorial sanctuary, so they can do whatever they want. If caught, they won't kill us nicely."

The distance between them and the pursuit team was steadily closing.

Every single pursuer operated Schema, and Shirone's group even had an injured member in Gardlok.

Gardlok shouted to Clove.

"Clove! Let's cast Aeos!"

"It's dangerous! Master, you're injured!"

"We'll all die at this rate anyway! Hey, we're getting out first!"

Gardlok cast the wind magic Aeos. As Gardlok floated up, Clove also flew up with the same magic.

Shirone was reminded of Fly magic from Aeos. If it was a similar mechanism, it would be difficult to maintain air balance in the narrow valley.

As expected, both men wobbled more as they rose higher. They looked ready to crash into the cliff at any moment.

Without them, there was no way to reach the Norse shelter. Thinking they needed to be saved, Shirone conveyed to his friends.

-Take one person each! Let's use Teleportation!

Canis wanted to use Darkport, but since four mages needed to transport two Mecca race members and two swordsmen, he had no choice but to select photonization magic.

Amy grabbed Tess, and Shirone grabbed Rian. Canis and Arin also grasped Kanya and Rena's hands respectively.

Meanwhile, the pursuit team had reached point-blank range.

The leading Kergo warrior raised his sword while on horseback. The silver longsword fell like lightning toward Shirone's head.

At that moment, Shirone's group's bodies transformed into flashes and shot upward.

Gardlok and Clove nearly had their magic dispelled.

Not only creating light but transforming into light itself. Moreover, simultaneously transporting even the Mecca race was unimaginable in heaven.

At least by human standards.

"H-how can you cast light magic without borrowing nature's power?"

Ancient magic must borrow elemental forces. Among these, light was the most difficult.

Light is weak and widely dispersed power. Therefore, even ancient magic that borrows nature's power faces difficulty in concentrating light.

Norse could only cast light magic when there was a Shining Spot where light gathered.

Clove's mind became troubled.

Shirone's group, who had caught up to their height instantly with Teleportation, were completely different from the pathetic, incompetent imitations he had thought them to be.

Even when he saw Shirone's Shining magic, he assumed it was just light transferred from some Shining Spot somewhere. But they created light from their bodies.

And as far as he knew, in heaven, the only beings who handled light besides Ra were those of a single status.

Arin, reading the Norse's emotions, conveyed through the mental channel.

-The Norse don't seem to know Teleportation magic.

Amy snorted.

-Of course! Photonization theory is one of the greatest discoveries in magical history, even in our world. Don't underestimate the geniuses of the land country.

Amy felt pride in being born in the land country.

But the sky's Kergo were no pushover either. They were racing vertically up the cliff using external gravity.

Amy lay horizontally and unleashed Fire Strike.

The pursuit team split left and right as they detected the flame spear plunging down. Making a wide detour around the cliff, they increased their speed further and closed the distance with Shirone's group.

-Tch! They're really persistent!

-Let me try.

Arin extended tentacles to attempt Mind Control.

Most of the pursuit team resisted, but one was caught. The warrior dominated by Arin swung his sword at his comrades, disrupting the pursuit formation.

"You idiots!"

The captain watching from below the cliff twisted his nose bridge. Then he took a deep breath and roared toward the cliff.

It was the Schema technique Howling.

"Awoooooooo!"

As Howling's reverberations spread along the cliff and struck the mages' minds, the Norse's Aeos was dispelled.

Shirone endured by exerting his concentration. Like Etela's Pharma's roar, it was a technique that shook the mind itself.

Shirone cast Teleportation on the falling Gardlok. Just as he caught his body, Amy flew over and grabbed Clove's ankle.

He cast photonization magic to reset inertia. As Shirone landed with Rian and Gardlok, his friends arrived on the ground one after another.

"Damn! Howling is always the problem. Norse have bad compatibility with Kergo."

Gardlok, his pride wounded, made excuses. Come to think of it, master and disciple weren't entirely different.

Then he was suddenly puzzled. He couldn't understand why Shirone's group was fine despite being hit by the same Howling.

"Hey, why are you guys okay?"

Sometimes asking innocently can be more irritating. Canis spoke curtly with such feelings.

"How could we be okay? My head's ringing like crazy."

"Then how did you cast magic?"

"We just endure it. If you'd be shaken by this level, don't call yourself a mage anywhere."

Unlike Norse who borrow nature's power, magic in the land country manifests by combining omniscience and omnipotence. It's undeniably a more demanding method than ancient magic.

However, that inefficiently honed concentration had the effect of strengthening their mental power.

Moreover, Shirone's group had many with special abilities.

Mental defense was Arin's specialty, being specialized in mental power, and Amy was completely immune due to her Insight ability. Furthermore, Shirone possessed Diamond Body mental strength, known to match Insight's effects in terms of durability alone.

Clove landed face-first in the stream. Then he stood up with an angry expression and looked back at Amy.

"You! How dare you slam me down?"

He could no longer tolerate Amy's impudent attitude. Her personality was nasty, but that too had its own charm, so he had been enduring it, but some imitation was climbing all over his head.

"I absolutely won't let this..."

Clove felt a chill and stopped speaking.

Amy's eyes were glowing red. Moreover, her expression as she glared at the pursuit team felt ghostly cold.

Amy spoke without even turning her gaze.

"Don't touch me during combat. I'll accept your whining later."

Clove slowly turned his head. The Kergo pursuit team was approaching with eyes flashing like wild beasts.

Clove's face turned into a tearful expression.

"It's all over. We're going to be caught. And we'll be tortured to death..."

"Don't interfere with strategy planning, and if you won't fight, get back."

What was the point of showing weakness when they were already at a tactical disadvantage despite winning in momentum?

When Amy grabbed Clove's back collar and pulled him, Clove, whose legs had gone weak, fell on his bottom.

This time, even Gardlok wasn't in the mood to look after his disciple and asked Amy without concern.

"Do you have some method?"

"I can't be certain, but it seems we somehow made it in time. Shirone, are you finished?"

"Yeah. It was close."

Gardlok tilted his head questioningly.

"What are you talking about? What's finished?"

Shirone looked up at the sky. His Spirit Zone had reached the sky in a curved form different from the Four-Direction Style's target type. Being an independent form, it took quite some time to modify.

Shirone cast photonization magic on everyone without touching them. It was Mass Teleport, the magic he had realized at the cost of risking his life on the cliff of the Unbridgeable Bridge.

"Catch them quickly! They're planning to escape again!"

The pursuit team's captain charged his subordinates forward. And he himself took a deep breath and unleashed Howling.

A roar swept over Shirone's group. Gardlok and Clove grimaced, but Diamond Body wasn't shaken. Compared to Marsha's sonic cannon, it wasn't even noise.

Shirone calmly watched the captain as if crushing the enemies' fighting spirit, then cast Mass Teleport.

A thick flash swept up the group and transported them to the cliff top where his Spirit Zone reached.

"Damn! Howling doesn't work!"

The pursuit team's captain ground his teeth in frustration.
