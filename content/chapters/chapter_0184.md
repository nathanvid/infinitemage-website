But thinking about it, Howling wasn't the problem. He had never seen magic that transformed into a giant flash and flew up into the sky.

"How did they even do that? Who were those people?"

Two tracking specialists began pursuing Shirone's group. One sniffed around like a dog while the other raised his head toward the sky with his tongue sticking out.

The man using his sense of smell declared defeat.

"Captain, the wind is blocked. We can't track them."

The man using his sense of taste held out a little longer. With his tongue extended to his chin and his eyes rolled back showing only the whites, he finally returned his gaze to normal.

"I can track them by taste. That way."

When the rear guard arrived, the captain mounted his horse. He turned toward the direction the taste specialist had indicated and said:

"They only crossed one wall anyway! They couldn't have gone far! Pursue them!"

"Kee-hya-hya-hya-hya!"

The pursuit team made strange cries as they retraced their path.

One minute later.

Shirone's group descended back to their original location riding the flash.

It had been Shirone's suggestion to use Kergo's tracking abilities against them.

Since their scent was already saturated in this place, tracking would be impossible. Therefore, they would only return after checking every other location.

Guardrak received Clove's support again. Pointing to a deep crevice in the valley, he said:

"Thanks to that, we survived. We won't encounter them for a while. Let's go this way. There should be a path."

Amy asked with a dubious expression.

"Where exactly is the Norse shelter? How much further do we have to go?"

"That's what I'd like to ask you. How do you manipulate light magic so freely? Do you extract it from the air?"

"We don't use methods like that. Why are you suddenly asking about this?"

"To travel to the Norse shelter, we need a place where light gathers. It's similar to the magic you cast but can fly much further. Anyway, trust me and follow. Just a little further and there's a Shining Spot."

The magic Guardrak mentioned was probably spatial teleportation. It seemed to be a method of borrowing the power of photons from places where light gathered to fly directly to the Norse shelter in one go.

It was a good choice. With this method, even if pursuers killed the guide, the Norse shelter wouldn't be exposed.

The Norse way of thinking was definitely like that of mages. A place where such people gathered. What kind of place would the Norse shelter really be?

With small excitement, Shirone followed the valley crevice to escape to the other side.

"Where the hell are they hiding?"

The pursuit team captain was troubled. They had been searching the area for 20 minutes but couldn't find any trace of their scent.

A reconnaissance group came galloping on horseback. Their eyes already showed clear signs of failure.

"They're not there. We couldn't find any signs of entry at Maru Valley or Fan Creek."

"Damn! To lose them when we had them cornered!"

"But Captain, isn't this strange? How did they escape when fighting us? That place definitely wasn't one of the light-concentrated areas the Norse talk about."

The captain had been thinking about that too.

As far as he knew, there were no mages in Norse who used such magic. They could be outsiders, but they had many similarities to humans.

Having conducted heretic hunting for 400 years now, he recalled a hint from ancient history.

"Could it be... humans from the earth?"

A sharp light gleamed in the captain's eyes. If they were humans from the earth, pursuit wasn't the issue.

Mecca digs into what is known, and Norse digs into what is unknown. But Kergo digs into God, and therefore they were the only divine subjects who knew all truths.

Humans from the earth weren't like imitations. At least to the Kergo, they were serious variables that could affect divine law.

"Cease the pursuit. Return to Shamain. Reporting comes first."

Following the pursuit team captain, his subordinates turned their horses around.

At that moment, vibrations suddenly came from the ground.

Everyone who had been casually looking around opened their eyes wide as the vibrations gradually intensified.

"Could it be...?"

The reason Norse used valleys as intermediate bases was because they were clean zones where no harm could come if you avoided just one divine law.

Therefore, these vibrations were something that should never happen. The story of whirlpool serpents appearing during daylight hours was an event not recorded in history.

"The divine law is... being disrupted."

Strong winds blew, casting a black veil over the vision of the 20 men.

In the state where nothing could be seen, what followed were screams and cries.

As time passed, their shouting voices gradually disappeared.

The darkness lifted, and sunlight descended to illuminate the cold valley. Thousands of pieces of flesh were floating on the red stream.

"Shamain?"

When Shirone made a puzzled expression, Kanya realized she had spoken too briefly and added an explanation. Meeting people from outside heaven for the first time, she sometimes forgot they came from earthly nations.

"It's the district where divine subjects live in heaven. It's also called the First Heaven."

"The First Heaven. You mean the first sky?"

Guardrak answered that question. As a heretic, he felt less burdened than Kanya in explaining heaven.

"Heaven is divided into seven districts from the First Heaven to the Seventh Heaven. Among them, the place where divine subjects live is called Shamain."

Shirone recalled the scenery he had seen from the sky.

Inside a huge circular fortress wall, six districts divided like pie slices and another district positioned in the center.

The seven heavens Guardrak mentioned referred to that.

"Do all races live together in Shamain?"

"That's right. The living areas are different, but they all live in the First Heaven. Even Kergo behave quietly there. Divine subjects are fundamentally protected by divine law. But Purgatory has extraterritorial rights. So heaven's divine law doesn't apply there. Surviving in this place isn't easy."

"How many races live in this place anyway?"

"Including Purgatory, countless. There are many creatures called outsiders whose origins are unknown. The unicorn beast you fought is also an outsider. But divine subjects who follow God's law are still only three races. Because they have different strengths and weaknesses, they join forces to form heaven's foundation. Norse love exploration, and Mecca love research."

"Then what do Kergo love?"

The corner of Guardrak's mouth lifted.

"Those guys love God."

"Guardrak! Such blasphemous words!"

Kanya snapped at him, but Guardrak didn't care.

From the moment he decided to become a heretic, no divine law governed him anywhere. He gained a painful life as the price for abandoning God, but that too was his will.

"Kergo love struggle. Their role is hunting. That's why they're the only race permitted to enter and exit Purgatory. Of course, the parties themselves seem to interpret it strangely."

This time, even Kanya had to agree.

"They're really an unpleasant race. Just because they use giant abilities doesn't make them giants. It's annoying to see them imitating those who follow divine law."

"But what exactly is divine law?"

When he first heard the word divine law, he interpreted it as he knew, but as time passed, it seemed to be used with a different meaning than in the original world.

Kanya looked back with an incredulous expression.

"You don't know what divine law is? Don't earthly nations have divine law?"

"No, they do exist, but I mean, do you absolutely have to follow them?"

"Of course. Divine law is the will of the great Ra. Those who oppose that will cannot exist. That's why it's called divine law."

Shirone spread both hands as if frustrated.

"But we're breaking divine law right now, aren't we?"

Kanya got angrier as if more frustrated.

"That's why we're suffering like this in Purgatory! Why can't you understand! Would you want to live your whole life in a place like this?"

Clove retorted to the words disparaging Purgatory.

"Hmph, what's so bad about it? It's much better than living your whole life in such a cramped place."

"Oh, really? Then go ahead and live well. Getting heretic hunted by Kergo for the rest of your life."

Just as Clove was about to snap back, Guardrak spoke up.

"That could be true. Anyway, we are those who defied divine law. So we were driven to Purgatory, but so what? At least we gained freedom."

"How is that freedom? It's just fear. The fear of not knowing when you'll die."

"We don't know when we'll die. But still, the right to die belongs to me. Isn't that enough?"

Kanya's expression hardened.

Divine subjects were known to gain eternal life, but death was still a sensitive issue. Especially when the words "right to die" came from a heretic's mouth, it was mockery of heaven.

Kanya couldn't contain her anger and snapped.

"Shouldn't divine subjects naturally follow divine law? After running away as you pleased, now you wrap it up with words like freedom and the right to die - do you think such packaging will make your lives better? This is why I don't like Norse."

Rena intervened.

"Stop it, sister. Fighting with heretics will have the same result anyway."

Kanya knew this too. She couldn't communicate with those standing at symmetrical points based on divine law.

But Guardrak, now that the situation had escalated, intended to see it through to the end. After his long life in Purgatory, he had accumulated much as well.

"Do you really think that way? Do you think you're right?"

"Of course! We're different! We came to Purgatory because heaven doesn't use things like elixirs. Once we get what we need, we'll return to Shamain and live happily there for life under God's protection!"

"You don't need to package it that way. You're also just a creature thirsting for eternal life, aren't you?"

Murderous intent gleamed in Kanya's eyes.

The reason she had remained quiet during the blasphemous conversation so far was because there was a tolerable line. But Guardrak had just crossed that line by far.

"Even if you're a heretic, I can't forgive such words. I could finish you off right here."

"Sister, don't do it."

Kanya shook off her sister's hand and drew her Arc. But Guardrak only looked at her calmly, with what could be interpreted as pitying eyes.

"Then why did you come looking for me? No, what are you trying to obtain from the Norse shelter?"

Kanya's shoulders flinched as she aimed the Arc.

"It's obvious without you saying it. Soon someone in your family will receive the wine of tales, right? That's why you came here to buy Norse medicine."

The Arc's aim wavered. At this distance, if she let go of the handle, there would be no way to stop the projectile. But she ultimately couldn't shoot. Tears poured out uncontrollably.

"What's, what's wrong with it? What's wrong with thinking of your parents! This has nothing to do with divine law! I just... I just want my mom to...!"

Perhaps heavenly men were also weak to women's tears, as Guardrak's emotions softened. He had once been a divine subject too. Therefore, he understood better than anyone how Kanya felt.

Rena embraced her sister and said to Guardrak:

"I'm sorry. My sister is..."

"I know. You don't need to apologize to a heretic. Mecca have strong family bonds. She must have gotten uncharacteristically excited. It's all because of this wound."

Guardrak awkwardly examined the wound on his abdomen. Only the muscle was cut; the organs were safe. The problem was blood loss - it wasn't severe, but the bleeding hadn't stopped.

Guardrak turned his body and said:

"Don't worry. Norse don't put emotions into their goods, so you'll be able to get what you want. However, you'll need quite a lot of elixirs. Norse business acumen is excellent."

Kanya wiped her tears and said spiritedly:

"Hmph, don't worry about that. I've saved enough for a year."

A sad smile crossed Guardrak's lips as he walked away.

Watching their conversation, Shirone felt gloomy. Many words were unfamiliar and the motivation for the emotional explosion was unclear, but this place also wasn't governed by absolute values.

What was the wine of tales? Was Ra really a god? Was this place heaven, or just another world?

When this journey ended, would he be able to return with all the answers?
