Gardrak found the location he was looking for not far away.

It was a place where the valley had subsided and cracked. The gap was just wide enough for a single person to enter, and a stream of light was descending through that crevice.

"Look here."

Gardrak pointed to the center of the flash. Only there was light uniquely concentrated. It looked fluffy like snowflakes, but upon closer observation, you could see particles of light swirling around.

Shirone stared at it and scratched his head. How could he explain this? Given the nature of light, particles naturally clumping together was impossible.

Of course, the Norse people's thoughts weren't different either.

Gardrak cupped his hands around the light particles, emphasizing that it was an unusual phenomenon.

"You see how light gathers only here, don't you?"

"Yes. But how is this possible?"

"It's called essence. The essence of light has settled in this place."

"So... you're saying the essence is gathering light?"

"No. The essence settled because light lingered here for a long time. Essence can settle anywhere. In wind, in water, even in thoughts. Of course, only if those thoughts remain unchanged for a long period of time."

Shirone thought it was similar to the concept of magic stones.

It was a phenomenon where a concept becomes substantiated when a certain property accumulates for a very long time.

"When essence settles in one place for a long time, it becomes a spirit. A spirit is... essence with activity. Moreover, it can make contracts with humans. If you contract with a light spirit, you can draw upon the power of light anytime, anywhere. But obtaining one is like plucking stars from the sky."

Shirone pointed to the essence and said.

"Then this light will eventually become a spirit too?"

"Haha, I suppose so. It would take about a thousand years, wouldn't it? As long as it doesn't dissipate in the meantime."

A thousand years. Far longer than the time given to humans. Probably the period for any property to become essence would be similar. Now he understood why obtaining spirits was like plucking stars from the sky.

"Anyway, we can reach Norse's refuge through here. Everyone gather over here."

"The space is narrow - shouldn't some people go to the other side?"

"It's fine. Come to think of it, the magic of the land kingdom doesn't have a wide radius. We can expand the scale as much as we want with just the light essence. Like this."

Gardrak grasped the cluster of light. His fist turned golden, and the color climbed up to his shoulder.

It seemed the light would soon spread throughout his entire body.

Since the power of nature is infinite, humans who borrow that power can expand their scale indefinitely.

However, it seemed to take quite a while.

Even after a considerable time passed without the light crossing his shoulder, a questioning look flashed in Gardrak's eyes.

"Strange. Why is it taking so long? Usually five minutes is enough."

"Master, hasn't the light essence weakened?"

"That can't be. I did it without problems three days ago. For the essence's energy to change would take at least hundreds of years. Unless some factor is weakening the essence's energy."

"But that's impossible. Only one law exists here. That's why we use this as an intermediate base too."

From Clove's words, Gardrak realized. It might be delusion, but ignoring the only correct answer to look for other factors was an even greater delusion.

"Could it be...! But why?"

The light essence began to waver. Then the ground, and finally the entire valley shook as if an earthquake had occurred.

"What's wrong? What's gone wrong?"

"Get out of here quickly! It's a whirlpool serpent! The essence is being disturbed!"

Since they would be crushed to death if the cliff collapsed, Shirone's group hurriedly escaped from the valley's crevice.

Looking from outside, the entire surrounding area was shaking. With this scale, whatever existence it was had to be nearby.

But looking around, nothing resembling a serpent was visible.

"Damn! Where is it? Where is it coming from?"

Rian drew his greatsword and stood in front of Shirone.

The mages also formed ranks and entered combat stance.

Tess concentrated her senses to scan the surroundings. The trembling on the left differed from that on the right. The creature was turning around the corner on the right.

When the ground shook so much that it was hard to stand upright, Tess finally felt something strange. Her senses and reality weren't matching. With this level of trembling, it should have appeared before their eyes by now.

"Th-there!"

Shirone pointed with a startled expression.

On a rock three meters away, a small, white creature was crouched on four legs, looking almost cute.

No, could this even be called a living being?

It had no eyes, nose, or mouth. Its form resembled a salamander, but its surface was smooth as if carved from jade.

He had never seen such a white creature in his entire life.

"What? This is the whirlpool serpent?"

"That's not it!"

At Gardrak's shout, Shirone reflexively stepped back. As his view opened up, he could finally see it.

The shadow of a whirlpool serpent was cast over the valley. Unbelievably, it was a massive shadow large enough to fill the entire cliff face.

Shirone turned his eyes back to the rock. The salamander-like creature's body was glowing intensely.

It was enlarging the shadow with the light emanating from its body.

When he realized this fact, the shadow jutting out from the cliff was already flying toward them with its enormous maw torn open.

A curtain of darkness blocked their vision. It was so beyond common sense in size that they didn't even think they were under attack.

The moment Shirone's group was trapped in pitch darkness, Gardrak, who had been watching from the valley's crevice, shouted.

"Danger!"

Shirone's Photon Cannon erupted.

The moment light spread, everyone realized that sharp shadow claws had approached right up to their noses.

If they had been even slightly later, flesh would have been torn away.

Kiiiiaaaaa!

The whirlpool serpent, torn by the Photon Cannon, screamed.

It was probably the same mechanism as Harvest. A creature without a mouth couldn't possibly have vocal organs.

When they came to their senses, everyone could see the whirlpool serpent's shadow rolling away like storm clouds.

It was fortunate they had blocked the first attack.

Most prey loses their lives to the whirlpool serpent's first attack. Because they're trapped in darkness and can't even see the incoming attack.

Amy wiped cold sweat and asked.

"What the hell is that thing? Is it alive or not? Is that salamander-like thing controlling it?"

Gardrak emerged from the valley's crevice and said.

"No, the whirlpool serpent's substance is the shadow. There's no main body. What's standing on the rock is just an 'avatar' created by the whirlpool serpent's shadow."

"Where in the world does such a thing exist? There has to be a main body for there to be a shadow!"

"I don't know either. We call this kind of thing 'the reversal of laws.' That's an outsider. I don't know where it came from, but it's definitely not a world we can imagine."

The whirlpool serpent didn't readily approach. Since there had been no light-emitting beings among the humans it had defeated so far, it was natural to be cautious.

As the avatar's body glowed, the shadow grew even larger. It was similar to a wild beast showing off in front of an enemy.

From this fact, Shirone realized. Perhaps this place might not be his grave after all.

"It seems similar to wild animals. Wasn't it a common predator in its original world? Like cats or mice. If it were an apex predator, it wouldn't make such defensive responses."

"Cats? Mice? Are you joking right now?"

Kanya spoke for everyone what they all wanted to say. But besides Shirone, there was one more person who realized this fact.

It was Canis.

He was watching the whirlpool serpent's every move with eyes full of wonder.

'It really existed, a world where darkness dominates light.'

The reversal of laws. The content written on Arcane's note was true.

"Shirone's right. If it's truly a world where rules are reversed, then all creatures would exist as shadows. In that case, the whirlpool serpent wouldn't be particularly strong. Of course, the situation is different here."

Gardrak examined the valley's crevice.

As expected, the light essence had weakened due to the whirlpool serpent's law activation.

Escape was impossible in this state.

But it wasn't time to give up. The wave of light Shirone had demonstrated was powerful enough to make the whirlpool serpent retreat.

"Hey, we've passed the crisis, but stay alert. Its weakness is light. That's why it doesn't operate during the day. I don't know why the law went awry, but if we use light magic, we have a chance."

Shirone recalled his battle with Harvest. The fact he learned from that fight was that shock wasn't important against darkness. The key was the total amount of energy.

When Shirone cast Photon Cannon, eight photons were born in irregular positions on the left and right sides.

Eight flashes all struck the whirlpool serpent. A terrible scream erupted.

Amy unleashed Fireballs. Fire also contained light, so it should be effective.

The whirlpool serpent's shadow caught fire.

But that was only about as much shock as an ant climbing on an elephant and pinching its skin. Honestly, the shadow was so enormous it seemed unfair.

Canis couldn't even attempt his magic. He tried attacking with the Power of Darkness, but it was absorbing his power instead.

Victory between the same attributes is determined by brute force.

If he couldn't dominate darkness greater than the whirlpool serpent, he would be the one consumed.

Shirone detached from his friends' group. If the creature's shroud enveloped them again, it could become truly dangerous.

True to its name, the whirlpool serpent moved by rotating greatly through space. When he struck its flank with Photon Cannon, it writhed in pain and then pursued Shirone.

As the whirlpool serpent turned sharply, its massive tail swept toward Amy's group.

Clove grabbed his head and screamed.

"Ahhhhh! It's coming!"

Amy deployed Fire Mist. The smoke of fire protected everyone, but this much couldn't burn the tail.

Just as the tail was about to sweep away the group like a broom, Amy additionally cast Fire Wall.

The tail caught fire. But its trajectory didn't change.

Amy bit her lip and increased the firepower. She intended to hold this position even if it meant death.

The tail flying toward Amy's torso suddenly moved away and grazed past her face. The whirlpool serpent had pulled back its body, unable to endure the pain from the fire.

"Shirone!"

Amy shouted without even catching her breath.

The whirlpool serpent opened its jaw and swallowed Shirone whole. Simultaneously, Photon Cannon exploded, and the serpent's face burst apart.

Photon Cannon's rapid fire erupted.

By Amy's calculation, it seemed to be about two hundred rounds per minute. For Shirone, who had set the school's top record in the Speed Gun test, it was entirely possible.

The firing rate was getting even faster. Then it became a single line of flash that pushed the shadow all the way to the opposite wall.

He had removed mass from the photons.

Since the impact force was zero, it couldn't tear through the shadow, but the flash gradually ate into the creature's body.

"What kind of magic is that? That's impossible! There's no way that can be possible!"

It was good that their ally was winning, but Clove couldn't accept the reality unfolding before his eyes.

Kanya and Rena felt the same bewilderment.

Unlike the Mecca race, Norse people could wield great power alone. But they had never seen anything like this, not even in heaven.

The sight of fighting alone against the whirlpool serpent that everyone feared was a marvel.

Above all, he was winning. Seeing the whirlpool serpent writhing while stuck to the wall sent shivers through them.

Shirone's flash began to turn red.

From Photon Cannon to photon output, and raising the energy level even further compressed it into a single-wavelength laser.

The whirlpool serpent pushed back the laser while recovering its shadow territory, but even that scattered in a chain explosion.

Kiiiiaaaaa!

It was a fierce roar.

The whirlpool serpent was afraid.

In its original world, it had been a bottom-tier predator. Then it had crossed through a strange tunnel to heaven ten thousand years ago.

Evolution was impossible in this place without natural enemies, and it had simply lived comfortably.

But now that comfort was about to be shattered. By the insignificant humans it had been tearing apart for fun until now.
