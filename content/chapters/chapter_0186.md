The whirlpool serpent split its shadow into dozens of strands and attacked Shirone.

Shirone was defenseless against the tentacle attacks flying at him from all directions.

At that moment, the laser scattered and spread into multiple beams.

The strategy of dispersing energy to destroy each target individually was an excellent choice. However, the damage per second inevitably decreased.

Shadows thicker than a giant's thigh pressed in close to Shirone.

The watching people screamed. They had the illusion that Shirone's body would soon be torn to shreds.

One tentacle couldn't withstand the energy accumulation and exploded. Then all the tentacles simultaneously erupted in explosions.

The chain of explosions pushed all the way to the main body.

The whirlpool serpent extended new tentacles, but now Shirone knew—that reaching an energy saturation state was faster than the time it took for the tentacles to reach him.

Because Shirone's energy was dispersed, the whirlpool serpent's durability had no choice but to be dispersed as well.

The battle that followed was an exchange of light and darkness.

Like two fleets floating on the sea maintaining distance while exchanging tremendous bombardments, dozens of tentacles created afterimages while Shirone's Flash followed and exploded them.

The tempo of attack and defense was so fast that the shadow movements couldn't be tracked with the eyes.

Shirone fired lasers while relying on the Spirit Zone's synesthesia for seventy percent of his senses.

The firing points numbered in the dozens, and the hyperdimensional rush of lines dominated the space.

Now it was a question of who would tire first.

Shirone sensed defeat. He felt like crying from the tension, but his mind, absorbed in battle, wouldn't even allow him to change his expression.

Just as Shirone's mind began to blur, the whirlpool serpent howled. It too was giving its all.

Thinking this way, he felt a sense of kinship.

The whirlpool serpent struggled as if sensing death, but there was no space left in its shadows to absorb energy.

The laser's energy shook the entirety of the whirlpool serpent.

An intense explosion occurred, blowing away the main body while shadow fragments scattered.

The laser, which had been gradually thinning, disappeared drop by drop in front of Shirone like water droplets.

People watched the situation's progress without even moving.

Shirone also steadied his mind, which wanted to collapse immediately, and glared at the whirlpool serpent's avatar.

The light disappeared from the salamander's body, returning it to the same white jade material as before. Then the saturation seemed to fade before it vanished as if assimilating with the air.

"Is it... dead?"

No one could answer Tess's question.

The creature that had lived here for a full ten thousand years had been analyzed by countless divine subjects and heretics, but death remained an unknown territory. This was because no divine subject had ever even cornered the whirlpool serpent, let alone killed it.

Rian stirred the spot where the salamander had been with his sword.

Gurdrak examined the canyon crevice. The spirit of light, having regained its power, was coming alive with brilliant light.

Gurdrak spoke with conviction.

"It's definitely dead. Or at least, it's not here anymore."

Only then did Shirone sit down. The others watched him in bewilderment.

A human from the earth had erased the law.

Kanya and Rena, Gurdrak and Clove knew what the current result meant.

That boy is dangerous.

It is law because it cannot be destroyed. Only God can change God's will. Shirone had violated the inviolable domain that permits change to no existence.

"What... what are you people? And what is that magic? How did you learn such magic?"

The group remained silent.

In truth, even they didn't know. Though the magical principles were the same, Shirone's magic was impossible to imitate.

Unique magic created from divine particles has its strengths and weaknesses.

Lasers have the potential to subdue strong enemies but are hard to be effective against fast-moving targets. Photon Cannon requires precise timing, and for a basic spell, it consumes a lot of mental energy.

But Shirone compensated for these weaknesses with light scattering, Diamond Body's durability, and infinite mental power drawn from Immortal Function.

The current Shirone was in a unique position that couldn't be classified as any particular type of mage.

Canis realized why the magic society called unlockers "Unique."

It wasn't just about opening Immortal Function. It was about how harmoniously one could arrange balance through their own omniscience.

In that sense, Shirone was becoming Unique.

Clove looked at Shirone with complicated feelings.

He was grateful to have his life saved and didn't want to harbor bad feelings, but the problem was what would happen if he entered Norse society.

They absolutely couldn't be dominated by an artificial being.

But since they couldn't subdue him with skill, what remained was to crush his spirit from the very beginning.

"There's no need to show off with just that much. If Master hadn't been injured, we could have easily escaped. Even for heretics, carelessly removing laws is dangerous. Since the whirlpool serpent has disappeared, a new law will be created, and you can no longer serve as a guide here. This time was dangerous so it couldn't be helped, but you should be more careful with your actions in the future."

Shirone wasn't listening. He was staring intently at something that had suddenly fallen from the sky.

It was a gem shining transparently in the shape of a water droplet.

"Hey! Can't you hear me? Are you ignoring me right now?"

Only then did Shirone turn his head. He pointed to the three gems that had fallen in front of him and asked.

"Um, what are these? They seemed to fall when the whirlpool serpent exploded."

"Huh? This, this...!"

Clove's eyes widened upon discovering the gems.

They were White Elixirs.

He had first encountered White Elixirs at the 'Norse Shop' in the mainland, a massive community.

At that time, they were auctioning a water droplet spirit, which was expected to be the highest-priced item on the market, and an independent Norse group not belonging to the community won the bid with 23 White Elixirs.

Unlike water spirits, water droplet spirits were difficult to obtain. Seas and rivers don't move, so spirits are born frequently, but water droplets aren't something that's constantly created.

Yet magically, they were weaker than water spirits.

However, contracting with a water droplet spirit would make skin smooth, prevent aging, and provide some healing ability, making them popular with women.

At that time, he knew the value of a water droplet spirit to be about 4,600 Red Elixirs or 670 Green Elixirs.

An item that required hunting about 7,000 unicorn beasts could be obtained for just 23 elixirs.

"White! It's a White Elixir!"

Clove flew through the air like a flying squirrel, reaching out his hand.

The moment he tried to grab the elixir, Shirone scraped the ground and snatched it away.

Clove, feeling the crushing sorrow of lost earth, frowned and turned his head.

Of course, since Shirone had caught the item, it belonged to Shirone. But human nature being what it is—other people's things always look bigger—he couldn't easily give up.

Especially since Shirone didn't even know the value of White Elixirs?

"Ahem, why are you looking at me like that? I just wanted to take a quick look."

"What is this?"

"Well, it's nothing much... It's called an elixir, something heretics use when trading goods. To determine its value, I need to look closely—could you show it to me for a moment?"

"Sure, fine. Here."

Shirone readily handed over the elixir. Clove quickly snatched it away, afraid Shirone might change his mind.

Kanya, understanding the situation, approached with fire in her eyes.

"Hey! Why are you taking that? Even heretics must have some rules. Don't you know that elixirs go to whoever hunted them?"

"What did I do wrong? And we hunted it together."

"What did you even do? The only person here qualified to have the elixir is Shirone. Give it back right now."

"Tch! You were fighting earlier, now suddenly acting friendly? I guess when elixirs are involved, there's no difference between artificial beings and divine subjects? Think I don't see through your scheme to get some scraps by sucking up?"

"How ridiculous! Divine subjects don't need elixirs! And Shirone, if you're going to live with Norse people in the future, remember this well! Elixirs are food and water, air and life. Especially White Elixirs have tremendous value! You can't just hand them over carelessly."

"It's fine. He just asked to take a look, so I showed him."

"What if he runs away with it? What would you do then?"

Shirone leaned back and braced himself against the ground.

"Haha! How would he run away?"

"How would he run away? Obviously..."

Kanya stopped mid-sentence and blinked.

Come to think of it, what could someone without any real skill do after snatching a White Elixir?

Shirone's friends standing behind were also watching Gurdrak's every move. But they showed no signs of tension either.

They knew that if Shirone wanted to, subduing Clove wouldn't take even a second.

Clove seemed to reach the same conclusion, showing clear signs of panic. His judgment had been clouded by greed. At least it was fortunate that he hadn't revealed his true intentions.

Gurdrak looked at him pathetically and said.

"Clove, give it back. It's not something you can handle."

His face red, Clove handed over the elixir.

"I just wanted to take a look. Here you go. Thanks for letting me see it."

Shirone took the elixir back. Tossing it up on his palm and examining how it reflected in the sunlight, he asked Gurdrak.

"But what is this used for? You said it was an elixir?"

Gurdrak checked how much the spirit of light had recovered. Judging by the rapidly intensifying brightness, they could probably depart in five minutes.

"You can't survive in Purgatory with just human strength alone. The environment is harsh and food is scarce. Some places have diseases, others have unquenchable sulfur fires that burn the air so you can't even breathe. Elixirs are items that allow humans to survive in such environments. There are five colors, and actually, none is superior to another. Every color is absolutely necessary. However, they're graded according to rarity. White Elixirs are the second rarest item. Thanks to their regenerative and purifying properties, they're an indispensable ingredient in air-making devices and wound-healing medicines."

"I see. Can I buy things with this?"

"Of course. There are merchants at the Norse shelter we're heading to, so if there's something you want, it would be good to buy it. But for White Elixirs, you'd probably need to go to the Norse Shop. It's the most active market on the mainland."

Shirone had one question.

Three elixirs obtained from the whirlpool serpent.

But if such items were traded casually, it meant someone was hunting creatures of similar grade to the whirlpool serpent.

Hearing Shirone's question, Gurdrak readily agreed.

"Purgatory is vast. Tremendously vast. Norse people have built their own society, but even before that, there were countless communities. The place we're going to is just the closest to heaven. The world beyond that is something we wouldn't even dare to leave. White Elixirs come from beyond that boundary. From those who can travel to places much farther than us."

Hoping there would be many merchants at the Norse shelter, Shirone tucked the elixir into his clothes.

Just like in the original world, if you can't exchange it for goods, gold coins are just minerals. No matter how precious White Elixirs were, unless he was planning to settle down in Purgatory, if there were necessary items, it would be profitable to just buy them outright.

As people gathered at the canyon crevice, Gurdrak grasped the spirit of light. As his body glowed and the ancient magic Elysian activated, white radiance spread through the canyon crevice.

As the knife-like scattered edges of light weakened, the original scenery was revealed.

The sound of desolate wind permeated the place where people had vanished.

**5. Norse Refuge (1)**

Ruins' remains were buried in the field. A shallow stream flowed, and wildflowers bloomed along the waterside.

The ruins, aged with time, felt more comfortable than desolate. Butterflies flew between tilted arches, and three or four people were taking rest.

Arriving at the Norse shelter, Shirone examined the arrival point.

Light was descending like a spotlight. Looking more closely, spirits of light flew up and down the pillar of light.

The ancient magic Elysian seemed to be magic that moved from light to light.
