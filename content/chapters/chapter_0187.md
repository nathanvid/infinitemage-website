"Is this the Norse refuge?"

"That's right. It's a place where the essence of light dwells particularly strongly. It can accommodate hundreds of Norse. I heard there used to be an altar of light here long ago, and its aftereffects remain."

"It's more peaceful than I expected. Is it safe from outsider attacks and heretic hunting?"

"It's not that far removed from those dangers. However, we've concealed it with a barrier of light. From outside the Norse refuge, this place only appears as an empty field."

It was similar in principle to invisibility magic.

Invisibility uses electrical force to bend light and create transparency. However, this place made the light reflection rate 100 percent, assimilating with the landscape like a mirror had been erected.

Someone with a keen eye might be able to find repeating patterns, but it seemed unlikely that any human would undertake such work across this vast land.

"Of course, if the higher beings of heaven wanted to perceive it, they could find it. But no one cares about life in Purgatory. Only the Kergo and starving outsiders get worked up about it."

A makeshift tent village had formed near the forest. Merchants could be seen laying out their wares on mats. Though they had no customers, they seemed to have no intention of selling anything anyway, leisurely chatting among themselves.

Gardrak explained that these were merchants heading to the mainland shops. This was literally a refuge, and to find proper goods, one would need to go to Norse shops.

Still, he said that divine subjects occasionally came here to obtain Norse items, and Kanya and Rena were that type.

Kanya had been tense since arriving here. While Purgatory was neutral territory, this place was heretical domain.

Perhaps for that reason, she didn't even make eye contact with Shirone's group and asked Gardrak instead.

"Where do they sell Norse medicine?"

"Hmm, I wonder if an apothecary came? Look over there."

As Kanya walked away, Gardrak shouted at her back.

"Remember one thing. Never fight in the Norse refuge. You know that, right?"

No answer came back. Instead, Rena looked back at Shirone with a bright smile. It was a pretty gesture meant to smooth over her sister's rudeness, but the girl's personal feelings were also contained in that smile.

"Big brother, see you later."

"Sure. I hope you find exactly what you're looking for."

Though the Norse refuge wasn't particularly large, it would be farewell since conversation would be impossible once they moved beyond Arin's Spirit Zone radius.

Shirone watched Kanya's retreating footsteps.

She looked anxious.

What had she left heaven to obtain?

While Shirone was lost in thought, Gardrak examined his abdominal wound. The bleeding had stopped, but the wound area was a mess. Without proper treatment, it could become dangerous.

"I'll rest for a moment. I'm tired from the blood loss. Listen to Clove about how to buy things. You'll need to know if you're going to live in Purgatory too."

Since his master's face was pale, Clove couldn't bring himself to refuse. Leading Shirone's group to the market stalls, he realized there were more merchants than usual and his eyes lit up.

"Hey, about that white elixir, are you going to use it now?"

"Well, I'll look at the goods first and buy what I need. Why?"

"If you're willing to pay a brokerage fee, I could negotiate for you. Since this is your first time here, you wouldn't know what constitutes good merchandise, right?"

There weren't many items available in the Norse refuge that could be obtained with white elixir. It would be like paying with gold coins to buy apples.

However, since Shirone didn't know what items were valuable, if he negotiated well with the merchants, there was a good chance of picking up some extras.

Shirone checked on his friends' positions. They were each scattered around looking at different items. Since they were connected through the mental channel, there seemed no need to gather them.

-Clove is asking for a brokerage fee. What should I do?

-Well, we probably do need a broker. Honestly, aside from clothes and food, I have no idea what they're selling here. But can we trust him?

Amy replied, and Arin answered.

-I can figure that out.

Shirone made his decision.

Through insight, he could tell if Clove was trying to cheat them. However, he hoped that wouldn't happen. He could pay any amount in fees, but wasting time on unnecessary emotional conflicts would be a loss for everyone.

"Alright, let's look around together. Show me what kinds of items are available."

As Clove took the lead, his friends also gathered around Shirone.

Perhaps because mainland merchants were included in large numbers, the variety of items was diverse.

First were daily necessities. Food, clothing, pillows, and blankets seemed common but were important items for heretics living in Purgatory.

Clove pointed to white bread that looked like pebbles.

"This is Kalaya, an essential item for heretic travelers. It's food made from elixir, so eating just one will keep you full all day."

Amy crouched down to examine it.

There were various colors available, but other than that, there were no distinguishing features to guess the taste.

If one Kalaya could solve a day's meals, it was a decent item, but whether it was a first-priority purchase was worth considering.

"Hmm, they're round and cute. Should I try one?"

When Amy threw out the bait, Clove eagerly bit.

"This is an amazing item. Even if you're stranded in the wilderness, you can survive for a month with just these. It's best to buy as many as possible when you can."

While saying this, Clove winked at the merchant.

Arin scratched her head awkwardly. It was such obvious insight that it didn't even need analysis.

Assuming her friends also knew this fact, she skipped unnecessary explanations and just gave her conclusion.

-Should we just do this ourselves? This kid doesn't seem to have any intention of doing this properly.

Amy also stuck out her tongue at his shamelessness.

-Seems that way. But let's keep him around for now. Who would have expected this pebble to be food? Anyway, we need someone to introduce us to the items. He's not lying, is he?

-Right. He's just thinking about earning elixir. He must really want it. Looking at it this way, I feel a bit sorry for him.

Canis felt dejected.

-That's right. Magic aside, his situational awareness and quick response are too poor. Can someone like that even hunt properly? That's why he's even more greedy.

While magical power varies tremendously by level, it cannot be a criterion for determining detailed superiority. Different magic is efficient depending on environment and circumstances, and there are compatibility factors too.

It was the same principle as how the whirlpool serpent lost to Shirone despite having overwhelming magical power.

To assess a mage's level, you need to see how quickly and accurately they perform magical judgments.

Of course, such aspects take even longer to develop than magic itself. This was also why stories frequently circulated of mercenaries who trusted only visible magical skills when hiring, only to be wiped out due to the mage's mistakes.

Having traveled the continent searching for Arcane's will, Canis had experienced this more than anyone.

Reviewing how effective Shirone and Amy's judgments had been in the three battles since arriving in heaven, Clove was at a level too embarrassing to even call a mage.

Next, Clove introduced them to a stall selling medicines.

Shirone had heard Kanya arguing with this apothecary earlier, but since the mental channel was disconnected, he couldn't understand what they were saying.

Clove introduced various medicines to the group.

Small bottles contained colorful drugs, which he said were made using elixir.

Red potions healed wounds and blue potions cleared the mind, he said. Those two types were the most common.

The other colored drugs also had unique effects.

Pink potion amplified feelings of love, and brown potion made specific memories permanently memorable.

Shirone pointed to a white potion he had noticed when Kanya was arguing with the apothecary.

"What kind of potion is this?"

Clove narrowed his eyes with surprise and picked up the medicine bottle.

"Oh? This was here? This is quite difficult to make."

"What's it used for?"

"This is a stimulant. The stimulant Epiness. Someone who drinks this can remain fine without sleep for a week. It has excellent effects on mages too. For example, if your mind is shaken by Howling, drinking this will help you endure sufficiently."

Shirone organized Clove's explanation in his own way. If the blue potion enhanced magical power, then the white potion seemed to have the effect of strengthening endurance.

"This is perfect for you guys. It's expensive, but I'll talk to them and get it cheaper for you. How about buying this?"

Shirone had no intention of purchasing Epiness. While mental strength that allowed going without sleep for a week would certainly have excellent effects, bringing consumables to the original world would be wasteful.

If it were a one-of-a-kind item, it would become difficult to time its use. In Purgatory, one might gulp it down whenever in danger, but for mages in that other world, it would actually become a mental burden.

He briefly thought it would be killer to drink before practical exams, but gave up thinking he might get expelled for taking prohibited substances.

After this trivial analysis passed, his thoughts returned to Kanya.

A stimulant.

What exactly was she planning to do with this drug?

When Shirone came to his senses, his group had moved on to the next stall.

Tree vines that would grow dozens of meters within 10 minutes of planting seeds were essential when traveling rocky terrain, he was told, and flame powder that would boil water when sprinkled after collecting it was also interesting.

While listening to Clove's explanations, Shirone looked back at Amy, who had been standing apart looking at something.

Curious about how she was staring at something without even blinking, Shirone walked over.

Inside a cage-like basket, something was moving around. It was a ball of fire.

Fire was alive and moving?

When Clove approached, Shirone pointed at the iron bars and asked.

"What's this?"

Clove, who had been peering into the cage, opened his eyes wide in surprise as if this was an unfamiliar item even to him.

"Wow! It's a spirit, isn't it? Mister, where did you catch this? You struck it rich."

"Haha! It's a long story. I had a good dream for once and went hunting outside the community. Sulfur worms give green elixir at a low probability, you see. So I caught a few, but they were all red. Damn, it was a bad dream, I thought, and was about to return when I ran right into a 'Fire Rake'. I ran like hell thinking of my wife. Then I tumbled down below a rocky cliff, and lo and behold, it was a flame spot. Fire had been burning for ages thanks to sulfur gas leaking from the ground. So I was about to drink a brown potion to remember the location, when the fire started bouncing toward me. I just spat it out. In my panic, I pulled out a spirit prison and caught it. That's how it happened, hahaha!"

Clove wasn't in the mood to laugh along. He just felt bitter about why such fortune never came his way.

Sulfur worms were outsiders commonly found not only in the fire country Muspell but anywhere there were volcanic regions.

They were meter-long worms that spewed lava but moved slowly, so even Clove could easily catch them.

However, Fire Rake was the problem - not only had he survived such a powerful outsider, but he had also obtained a fire spirit. It seemed he must have been born under the law of heavenly fortune.

Shirone looked back at Amy. She was looking at him with eyes that didn't know what to do.

Shirone fully understood her desire to have it.

If a light spirit had been trapped in that cage, he couldn't know how he might change either.

For the first time, Shirone seriously asked about value.

"Mister, how much is this?"

Conveying meaning through telepathy was unfamiliar even to merchants. But he just blinked and responded calmly.

While one might think that's just how merchants are, Shirone inferred one possibility from his reaction.

The fact that they might not be the only ones in this world who didn't use the divine subjects' language.
