Shirone's prediction was accurate, and the merchant went further to deduce that they hadn't been in Purgatory for very long.

"Hmm, we could negotiate, but I don't think you'll be able to afford it. Spirits are extremely hard to come by even in Purgatory. I'm planning to take this to the mainland and only stopped by the refuge briefly."

Though he had expected the value wouldn't be low, being refused even negotiation made him suddenly nervous.

Could it be purchased with 3 White Elixirs? If he boldly approached only to find the elixirs insufficient, Amy's disappointment would grow even greater.

Thinking he needed a standard for judgment, Shirone set aside bargaining and asked a question.

"I heard spirits can make contracts. Would it be possible with this spirit too?"

"Contract? Ah, a contract. Of course it's possible. But what would you do contracting with a fire spirit?"

"If you contract with a fire spirit, you can use fire magic, right?"

"That's true, but... usually people don't waste precious spirits on contracts. Think how convenient life becomes when a spirit enters a village. That's why communities usually pool elixirs together to acquire them. People from the outskirts of communities live in such barren places and have surplus elixirs, so they buy with contracts in mind, but honestly, aren't those folks the type who live risking their lives? I don't think you'd live that kind of life."

"Hmm, anyway, contracts are possible, right?"

When Shirone asked again, the merchant nodded as if he couldn't help it.

This was actually a common reaction on the mainland. Riffraff without the ability to pay would make their own demands, and sometimes reconnaissance teams would infiltrate to drive down the value of goods.

If people from community outskirts participated, that's where auctions would end, but such people showed no interest unless it was a special spirit. Most of the time, they engaged in nerve-wracking bidding wars in tense atmospheres.

Amy fidgeted with her fingers. While bargaining was her specialty, she couldn't say anything now.

If this were a world where gold coins were used, she would have bought it even by emptying her savings. But this was Purgatory, where only things directly connected to life held value.

In such a situation, she didn't want to reveal her desire for possession and make things difficult for Shirone.

Shirone already knew. For a mage, improving magical power could be said to be everything in life, so he wanted to obtain it for her if possible.

Sensing the moment of decision had come, Shirone asked again.

"Then how many elixirs would I need to buy the spirit?"

The merchant let out a dismissive laugh. But seeing Shirone staring intently and waiting for an answer, he thought with a serious expression.

"Hmm, if you were to purchase it here, at minimum..."

Shirone's heart pounded. Whatever price he named, he hoped he could buy it with the elixirs he currently had.

As expected of something quite expensive, the merchant was also cautious. He continued deliberately.

"White Elixir..."

Disappointment filled Shirone and Amy's eyes. The fact that the unit of elixirs was "White" meant the probability had dropped considerably.

Having finished his thoughts, the merchant raised his head and presented the price.

"I'd have to receive about 1."

"What? 1?"

Shirone doubted his hearing, which had never betrayed him before.

If it was 1, he could purchase it.

Realizing the same fact, Amy trembled her knees with anxiety as if someone might snatch it away.

Shirone considered various factors. At first, he had thought it would be good if he could just afford to pay, but a mage should let past thoughts go without attachment.

But the moment he looked back at Amy, he couldn't help but smile. She had bitten her lower lip and spoke in a barely audible voice.

"I want it."

Amy, the only daughter of the Carmis family, had grown up wealthy enough not to know material desire. But when it came to magic, she was just another mage.

The merchant understood Amy's "I want it" as resignation. White Elixirs were items that even mainland merchants couldn't easily handle, so it was natural for those who had just entered Purgatory to despair.

Reminded of his daughter's face, he comforted Amy.

"White Elixirs are hard to obtain. Actually, this is already heavily discounted. Going to the mainland causes many troublesome things. It's dangerous too. This conclusion was made under the assumption that I could sell it at Norse Refuge and return home. I calculated precisely because you seemed serious. Don't be too heartbroken. Maybe someday, if you're lucky, you might be able to obtain a fire spirit."

"I'll buy it."

"Huh?"

"I said I'll buy it."

When Shirone reached into his inner pocket, the merchant blinked like an idiot. This was surely some trick to mock him, but he couldn't decide whether to get angry or laugh it off.

But seeing 3 elixirs rolling around in Shirone's hand, he fell from his chair as if shocked.

Just from the rainbow spectrum alone, they were definitely White Elixirs.

"Here. I can take it now, right?"

The merchant nodded wordlessly. Shirone personally placed the White Elixir in his hand.

At the same time, Amy pulled the spirit prison into her embrace.

She felt warm heat.

The warmth of fire.

This was Amy's life.

"Hey, are you alright? Isn't it hot?"

The merchant, having confirmed the elixir was real and regained his senses, asked.

Fire spirits were differentiated from inanimate objects by being active, but until a contract was made, they were still fire anyway. If you grabbed a heated iron cage, you should normally get burned.

"Huh? No. It's just warm?"

"Strange. May I examine it once more? I'm selling it, but my conscience is bothering me. It might be defective."

"No, it's fine. This really is a fire spirit."

Amy lovingly gazed at the fire spirit bouncing in the air. And she spoke to Shirone using the mental channel.

"Shirone, it's a Spirit Zone."

"Spirit Zone?"

"Yeah. This is amazing. It's real fire but also connected to the mind. I'm constantly receiving sensations from it."

A mage doesn't get burned by fire they create. Though it's real fire, it's because the creator is a mage.

According to Amy's words, spirits seemed to be beings with fixed Spirit Zones as well. They had become a kind of mental sublimation.

"But how did you obtain White Elixirs?"

"They came from a whirlpool serpent."

"A whirlpool serpent? You mean you destroyed the law of the valley?"

"It happened that way somehow."

If they were powerful enough mages to defeat a whirlpool serpent, having White Elixirs wasn't strange.

Though not commonly encountered, such types definitely existed in Purgatory. Merchants called such people boundary dwellers or people from community outskirts.

"But how do you make a contract?"

"Ah, I don't know well, but I've seen boundary dwellers do it. They hold the spirit in their hands and mutter something, then it disappears by itself."

Since spirits had no reason, it probably wasn't activated by keywords. That left spirit language magic.

Speak and contemplate. Resonating with fire was important.

Amy opened the cage with the key the merchant handed her. Then, holding the spirit with both hands, she recited an improvised incantation.

"Fire spirit, dwell within me."

As the fire spirit seeped into Amy, she felt hot energy in her stomach.

Contracting with a spirit was similar to realizing new omniscience. Separate from Ignite, the omniscience of ignition, she had gained the ability to perceive new fire.

When Amy summoned the spirit, a fireball bloomed and circled around. Watching contentedly, she recalled the name of a bogus flame said to exist in ancient times.

Jack-o'-lantern.

This phenomenon, also called will-o'-the-wisp, eventually disappeared into a page of mythology without being verified despite countless scholars' hypotheses.

But not anymore. Jack-o'-lanterns existed as ancient magic in the country called Heaven.

The fire spirit was strategically useful.

First, it was good that it activated regardless of Ignite, and it could move in desired trajectories as well as split into multiple illusions.

Endless strategies came to mind: guidance functions, deception, multiple shots.

Amy noticed Shirone's gaze and extinguished the spirit.

She should say thank you, but it wouldn't come out easily. It would just make things awkward.

This was different from receiving an expensive gift. What she had received was probably Shirone's heart.

Shirone smiled. And as if he had known she wouldn't say anything, he turned and walked away.

Only then did Amy begin to regret. Why hadn't she said anything? Did he know her feelings? Or was there no special meaning to the gift from the start?

Shirone had an unpretentious personality, but sometimes like this, you couldn't tell what he was thinking.

Shirone carefully looked around at the goods.

Watching Amy contract with the fire spirit, he realized that the idea of finding things to take back to the original world was complacent.

Heaven was dangerous enough to cross between life and death, and if anything needed reinforcement, they had to find immediate combat power. If such things existed, buying them regardless of value was the way to increase survival rates.

Norse Refuge mainly sold daily necessities since it was where heretics belonging to communities mostly stayed.

Of course, it wasn't that there were no merchants with special items. They just didn't put them on the market because they were so expensive.

When one merchant learned Shirone possessed White Elixirs, he quietly placed an item on his stall.

Tess ran over and pointed to the merchant's item.

"Oh my! Isn't this that thing?"

A mechanical device shaped like a beetle.

It was a drone made with Mecca race technology.

Clovis ran over to explain. Having realized Shirone was a big spender, he was even more enthusiastic.

Besides the reconnaissance and language decoding functions they already knew about, it had radio communication and map display functions.

"How about it? Won't you trade for White Elixir? As you know, drones aren't something you can buy just because you have elixirs. They're equipment exclusive to divine subjects."

Shirone was also positive about this item. He had experienced the drone's reconnaissance abilities through Kanya. If Tess could use it, it would be excellent auxiliary equipment.

Then Arin conveyed that they might be able to get a discount. She had caught feelings of overpricing from the merchant's insight.

But the cheap price was rather puzzling.

If the fire spirit was a product, the drone was a limited product. If it was leaked divine subject equipment, couldn't he name any price?

"Arin, isn't there some defect? Otherwise..."

"I'm thinking the same thing, but I'm not sure. Anyway, it's definitely overpriced for its value. You figure out the rest."

Tess couldn't take her eyes off the drone. Being fascinated with ancient artifacts, she would definitely accept it whether it had defects or not.

Shirone asked on her behalf.

"How did you obtain it? I understand it's only personally issued to the Mecca race."

"Of course. But there are heretics among the Mecca race too. They probably stole it before fleeing to Purgatory. Selling just one would be enough to live on. As proof, look here. There's a band connected between the drone's edges, right? This is proof it's never been used. Meaning, it was taken straight from the factory. The original owner was probably someone who worked at a Mecca race technical facility."

"Where is that person?"

"Don't know. They might have fled, or died. Probably died. That's usually how Heaven's goods appear on the market. When people steal Heaven's goods to earn elixirs but die in Purgatory, only the goods remain."
