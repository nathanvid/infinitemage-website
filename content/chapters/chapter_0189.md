Indeed, such a situation was possible. Just because it belonged to divine subjects didn't mean the item was impossible to purchase.

Even so, he believed the limited edition merit was still maintained.

Above all, the merchant knew the customer's payment limit was two white elixirs. The fact that such a greedy man was asking for just one elixir meant it was actually worth much less than that.

"Can anyone use it?"

"Anyone can use it just by equipping it. Hunting weapons like Signa, Exd, and Arc are communal, but drones have personal encryption devices. Even if you steal someone else's, you can't use it. But this is still a new product that hasn't found an owner yet. That's why I can sell it."

He didn't understand. If it was new, there shouldn't be any defects.

Was this a simple misunderstanding from not understanding this world? Or was a fire spirit really that difficult to obtain?

Unable to make a decision, Shirone asked Tess.

"Tess, do you want this?"

"Yes! Shirone, I really want it. Buy this for me. The other stuff is cheap anyway, so we can get it anytime later."

Shirone couldn't help but chuckle. Even when making requests, her straightforward personality was certainly different from Amy's.

The elixirs would be best used for everyone anyway. So he should buy it, but since he didn't know what defects it might have, he couldn't negotiate.

Asking directly would surely let the merchant manipulate him, and Klove wouldn't provide any help.

"Why won't you sell it! I brought exactly what you asked for!"

Just as Shirone was pondering, Kanya's voice could be heard.

Everyone turned to look. Unlike Kanya, the merchant wore a relaxed smile.

"Listen, miss. Where are there fixed prices in Purgatory? It's an auction, an auction. The price has gone up, so you can't arbitrarily lower the price."

"You said exactly that a month ago! You said one green elixir would be enough to buy Epiness! I'm even adding 30 red elixirs on top of that, so why won't you sell it!"

Epiness.

Shirone recalled the white potion the apothecary had recommended.

But Kanya's reaction was too intense for it to be simply a stimulant. What could there be in heaven that required staying awake?

"That was a month ago. But now the price has gone up."

"No! Two months ago, three months ago, there was no such talk! This is profiteering!"

"Miss, auction prices are determined by buyers' desires. The greater the desire to have something, the higher the price rises—isn't that basic? You don't have much wine of tales left, do you?"

"You... you..."

Kanya's face turned pale. How could he say such things, even if he was a merchant?

Even the despicable Klove frowned this time.

The merchant's expression didn't change even when stared at with murderous intent. He had never intended to sell anything to divine subjects from the beginning.

"Getting Epiness today means your family will die within days. Therefore, miss, you must buy this. So I'll charge a high price—what's the problem with that?"

"You! I won't let this go!"

As Kanya drew her Arc, Rena screamed and stopped her.

Violence was forbidden in Norse Refuge. If violence occurred, it wouldn't end with just being kicked out.

Maintaining the community was a rational agreement among the majority. The moment discipline broke down, the community would collapse.

"Sister! Please endure it! If you fight here, you'll die!"

Rena pulled at her sister's waist. Even while being dragged away, Kanya didn't stop her verbal abuse.

The merchant ignored the troublesome customer and exchanged glances with the apothecary across from him.

A silent agreement to never sell Epiness.

It was an oligopoly.

Three months ago, when Kanya came to buy Epiness, the merchant quoted a price so high she couldn't pay it.

In reality, it was something that could be exchanged for about 40 red elixirs, but he demanded a green elixir.

Elixirs were different from currency. Arbitrary exchanges were possible, but if the other party insisted on green elixirs, no amount of red elixirs could buy the item.

Eventually, Kanya had to purchase green elixirs at higher than their actual value. And when she came to buy the item again, the merchant was saying he wouldn't sell even at that price.

"Why is she so agitated? What is this wine of tales?"

"It's the art of life regeneration."

Gadrak's voice was heard. He had been sleeping and came out because the stalls were noisy.

He could guess the situation just by looking at Kanya's murderous expression. Though it was his first time meeting her as a guide, he had heard rumors circulating among merchants.

"As you know, divine subjects have predetermined lifespans. When their lifespan ends, they're reborn through the wine of tales. I heard that girl's mother is the target."

"What exactly is this art?"

Gadrak squinted one eye.

"I'd like to keep quiet about that. As you can see, it's a sensitive issue. Divine subjects call the wine of tales a blessing. On the other hand, most outsiders feel repulsed by the wine of tales, which is why they escaped heaven. That merchant over there is the same. He's not tormenting her because of elixirs."

"But you said Kanya's mother's lifespan is ending. So what role does the stimulant play? Can she live if she drinks it?"

"No. The law is never violated. By outsiders' standards, Kanya's mother will die soon. Yet the reason she wants to buy Epiness is..."

Gadrak let out a groan.

He too had once been a divine subject. Knowing what Kanya wanted to do at the risk of her life, he felt sympathy.

"It's nothing. Just a ray of light given in despair. Like administering painkillers to someone dying of illness."

Shirone felt heavy-hearted. He didn't know how different the mindsets of divine subjects and outsiders were, but he thought the sincere desire to ease a parent's suffering would be universal.

But the law distinguished even that.

Kanya returned to bargaining. It was obvious she was holding back her anger to buy Epiness.

There were two stalls selling Epiness, and probably if not today, Kanya would have no more opportunities.

Shirone looked at the apothecary on the opposite side. Perhaps feeling guilty, he was hanging his head.

If he bought Epiness from him and gave it to Kanya, wouldn't everything be solved?

As if reading Shirone's thoughts, the man quietly put away the Epiness. Since contracts were absolute to Norse people, he was preventing the situation from escalating unnecessarily.

Kanya presented her last resort.

"Fine! Then I'll do it on credit. I'll do whatever it takes to get elixirs, so please give me the Epiness."

"What can you get?"

"Anything! I'll hunt for my entire life to get them!"

"That's why I'm asking. What will you get?"

The merchant no longer hid his emotions.

He despised divine subjects to a horrifying degree. And he hated heaven. No matter how good the medicine, memories of living in heaven couldn't be erased. Ra's law was that powerful.

"I said I'd give everything, but you refuse, so you tell me. What exactly do I have to do to buy that medicine?"

"Really? Then since you say you'll buy it even if I refuse, let me tell you. Hmm, what would be good..."

The merchant, pretending to think, looked at Shirone and said:

"How about all the elixirs that boy has?"

Shirone realized the merchant's strategy had been hastily revised.

He had probably been calculating since Kanya brought Shirone along.

It was natural for a merchant. But it was vicious.

Seeing the white elixirs made him greedy, but he had no high-value items among his possessions. So he linked it to Kanya.

Setting emotions aside, it was a decent strategy.

He had heard Norse people were good at business. He was certainly an excellent merchant. But he was definitely not a good merchant.

Kanya was so dumbfounded she couldn't speak. The more the situation became clear, the more she felt she was being played by a con artist.

"Now I understand. You never intended to sell it from the beginning. For three months, you've been enjoying yourself hoping I'd die in Purgatory! What did I ever do so wrong to you?"

Shirone felt sorry for her. Emotional responses like Kanya's don't work on mages. They're masters at using others' psychology to make situations favorable.

If you want to anger a mage, you have to counter in the same way.

"You're making me out to be the bad guy. The more this goes on, the harder it gets for you, miss. I didn't suggest anything impossible, did I? Rather than hunting for your entire life, getting that boy's elixirs would be much easier. Don't you think?"

"That's theft! Robbery! Besides, we can't even fight here! How am I supposed to get elixirs from someone who has nothing to do with me?"

"There are various ways, aren't there? You're a woman and that boy is a man, so methods depend on how you find them."

Kanya's lips trembled. She wanted to shoot the merchant's face with her Arc. But the fact that there were no more opportunities made her calm down.

What reaction would Shirone show if she asked for elixirs? Elixirs that were like life itself to outsiders.

Yet somehow... she thought he might help. Even if Rena was naive, she was good at judging people.

*It's not because brother Shirone is handsome that I like him, but because he's kind.*

She had scoffed at the time, but he was certainly different from ordinary outsiders. Maybe he would give up his elixirs? Those expensive white elixirs? Maybe. Maybe!

Everything was hypothetical. Yet the reality of having to rely on hypotheticals was miserable.

For her mother's sake, she had to do whatever it took. She couldn't let her mother, who had lived only half the life of an ordinary divine subject, pass away like this.

Leaving the merchant's bitter smile behind, Kanya headed toward Shirone. Shirone's expression, already knowing the situation through their conversation, was only calm.

Kanya felt chilled. What was he thinking? It wouldn't be good thoughts. He would ask why she was approaching. He would ask what relationship they had.

Even so, she would plead. She was prepared to abandon everything.

Approaching Shirone, Kanya spoke with a miserable heart.

"Um..."

"Here."

Shirone extended his hand. A white elixir was placed there.

Kanya choked up. The surging emotion resembled anger but didn't hurt at all.

Why was this man acting like this? Shouldn't he at least give her a chance to kneel? Wasn't buying emotions with money the purpose of good deeds? What meaning did this kind of mercy have?

Kanya thought she should ask. But she doubted whether words would come out properly.

"Why..."

"Go buy the Epiness first. It's precious to you, isn't it?"

"But..."

It's not precious to you, is it.

She wanted to say this, but her throat was locked and no sound came out.

This boy was different. Different from humans and different from outsiders. Even... different from Ra.

The moment the blasphemous thought occurred, Kanya had a thrilling experience. She wondered if this might be the prelude to corruption.

"Thank you."

Barely able to get out one word, Kanya returned to the merchant.

Indeed, Purgatory seemed to be a different place from heaven. Strange emotions she had never felt in her life intersected.

She approached the merchant with tired steps and handed over the elixir.

"Here, now give me the Epiness."

"No. I can't sell it for this."

"Why... why again?"

Kanya didn't even have the strength to shout. The single thought of having to hold back tears was the only support keeping her standing on two legs.

"I said all the elixirs that boy has. And by my calculations, there should be one more elixir."

"No. I have no elixirs left."
