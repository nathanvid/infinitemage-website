Shirone threw an elixir to the merchant who owned the drone.

The merchant's body trembled as he caught it with both hands. He was so overcome with emotion that he could barely hold it properly.

It wasn't a red, green, or yellow elixir—it was a white elixir.

Shirone flipped his palm and said, "How's that? We're done now, right? Give Kanya the item."

"This won't work. That elixir also needs to be mine for the deal to go through."

"Then go ahead and take it from him."

The merchant's eyes flickered. He realized Shirone's action wasn't mere provocation.

As if proving a point, Shirone looked back at the merchant fondling the elixir and asked, "So what are you going to do? Can you give it back?"

"N-no! Canceling the deal is absolutely out of the question!"

The merchant waved his hands frantically in horror.

Of course, Meca's drone had high value—provided the item was in working condition.

The drone he had sold off was actually something that would have been settled at the yellow elixir level. Having traded it for a white elixir was a once-in-a-lifetime profit.

"So, what will you do now? Are you heretics going to have a friendly fight amongst yourselves? That seems to be your specialty."

The apothecary's face hardened.

This kind of situation was indeed troublesome. He could be as shameless as he wanted when bargaining with customers, but conflicts between merchants brought no benefits whatsoever. This was especially true among lower-tier community merchants who mainly dealt in daily necessities.

Only then did the apothecary study Shirone carefully.

Seeing him apply pressure this way, he was definitely a Norse. And not an easy one at that.

Should he just accept one and move on? Trading Epiness for a white elixir would be a deal that went down in history.

But it was a matter of pride. He didn't want to accept that things had gone according to a divine subject's will.

"Fine, I won't sell. So be satisfied with your toy. You know what? You've cruelly trampled on this young lady's hopes."

The merchant threw in the towel. He chose the pleasure of victory over money.

It was a zero-point deal as a merchant, but if he could watch a divine subject cry, it didn't seem to matter.

Shirone realized he had lost the game.

"No, you have to sell the medicine. Otherwise, you'll be in breach of contract."

"What? What contract am I breaching?"

"You said it yourself. You'd sell the medicine if I brought all the elixirs I had. Kanya did that. But now you're suddenly canceling the deal—that's breach of contract. You know what happens when a merchant loses credibility, don't you?"

It wasn't just knowing—it would be the end. At minimum, there would be no place for him in the community.

But he felt somewhat wronged. After all, it was Shirone who was being unreasonable.

"Speak properly. When I proposed the contract, you had two elixirs. And since you bought the drone right after the contract was made, I haven't violated anything."

"How do you know that, when I bought the drone?"

The apothecary's pupils shook with shock. Though he had lost his composure, his long experience as a merchant gave him intuition.

He was the one at a disadvantage.

"I already had a contract to buy the drone. I just hadn't handed over the elixir yet. For someone claiming to be a merchant, making deals without confirming such details—you still have a long way to go. If you doubt it, feel free to verify."

The apothecary ground his teeth. Things were flowing exactly as his intuition suggested.

The merchant who sold the drone would side with Shirone no matter what. Proving he had a contract with Shirone would transfer ownership of the white elixir to him.

This was commonplace on the mainland. He too had made excessive profits through monopolies, so he wasn't in a position to criticize others.

'Why am I at a disadvantage? Shouldn't it be the opposite?'

Reviewing the situation, the apothecary realized Shirone had known the drone's value was lower than expected.

He didn't know how Shirone had investigated, but if this wasn't the case, the current situation wouldn't exist.

The merchant was siding with Shirone because he had made several times the profit.

An exclamation escaped him. Shirone understood the fundamental nature of humans when it came to material goods. It was skill that would work even among mainland merchants.

"How about it, mister? We had the contract first, right?"

"Of course we were first. Even before that girl started shouting, we had already finished our verbal contract to hand over the drone in exchange for the white elixir."

Though no one had asked, Shirone had verified it directly.

Now there was no way out. If another merchant had made a contract, it was the fault of the merchant who failed to confirm the customer's limits.

Should he retreat like this? Even one white elixir was an enormous harvest, but it was a matter of pride.

He pulled out the most despicable card a merchant could use.

He would cut open his own belly.

"My mother was a divine subject of heaven. But she didn't receive the wine of tales. Do you know why?"

When no one answered, the apothecary tapped his head and continued, "She went insane. My father was murdered in heaven. By some lunatic who had a crush on my mother. And do you know what punishment was handed down? Forty years of life reduction. But he still had forty years left to live. Even though our father was dead. My mother cursed that man for her entire life, heh heh. But ridiculously, the wine of tales ceremony was scheduled. Together with that lunatic who killed my father."

Kanya's pupils shook.

Shirone didn't understand what significance this held, but everyone except his companions was aghast.

"So my mother took her own life. Since the number of ceremony participants decreased, I had to bear the remaining sins. That's why I fled, avoiding the divine law. Do you understand now? I hate divine subjects. Just looking at them makes me want to vomit! Do you think I'd sell medicine to you?"

In short, he was saying since the lid was off, let's all die together.

Shirone responded with a snort.

People who truly decide to self-destruct don't explain their reasons. In a situation where both sides die, the process doesn't matter.

What he wanted was an emotional victory, and Shirone had no intention of indulging him.

"So are you going to sell the medicine or not?"

"I won't sell it. I won't give back the elixir either. I've decided, so do whatever you want."

"Then I have no choice but to take it by force."

"Go ahead. But will that be okay? If you use violence, you won't be able to live in the community. You'll have to wander for the rest of your life."

Shirone extended his hand. Photons compressed, and a white sphere vibrated.

The apothecary was horrified. This kind of magic was impossible. If anyone could do it, it would only be people from the community outskirts who had contracts with light spirits.

"You... are you a border person?"

"The whirlpool serpent was quite strong. Thanks to it, I obtained three white elixirs."

Shirone showed no emotion.

And the apothecary knew that mages became most cruel and ruthless when they suppressed their emotions.

"What kind of elixir do you have in your body?"

Everyone knew the apothecary's survival would depend on his answer.

The apothecary agonized for a long time. He had reached the bottom of the bottom. Finally realizing he couldn't win, he raised his hands with a bitter smile.

"None. There's no elixir in my body. So spare me."

Shirone fired a Photon Cannon. A single flash grazed the apothecary's nose and crashed into a pillar of the ruins.

An explosion erupted, and the pillar burst apart.

The apothecary looked back at Shirone with a face drained of humor.

"Don't laugh. You might be bluffing, but I'm serious. I don't care about divine law or the community. If you act despicably one more time, I won't forgive you then."

"Alright, I understand. I get it. Calm down."

The apothecary realized the gravity of the situation.

Shirone had shown maximum hostility short of violence. In terms of a swordsman, it was like drawing his blade; in terms of a beast, it was baring his fangs.

Realizing there would be no further compromise, the apothecary threw the Epiness to Kanya.

"There, satisfied? The contract is finished."

"One more thing remains. Apologize to Kanya."

"Why should I? You don't have the authority to interfere with my personal feelings."

"But you also have painful memories, don't you?"

"What does that have to do with apologizing?"

"I'm not saying you must apologize unconditionally. Words without sincerity have no value. But didn't you also want someone to acknowledge your past wounds?"

Is that really so? Am I... still unable to escape?

The apothecary looked at Kanya's pitiful expression. She had said the person waiting for the wine of tales was her mother.

At that time, his mother hadn't been in her right mind. She screamed every day and self-harmed. The terror she felt had come to him as even greater terror as a child.

"Tch, as if I'd apologize."

The apothecary snorted and packed up his stall. After putting medicine bottles in his bag first and rolling up the blanket on his backpack, he stood up, dusted himself off, and threw a purple potion to Kanya.

"It's called Korphin. A nervous system enhancement potion. Since I made a decent profit, I'll give it as a service. It'll be effective if used with Epiness. Though it'll probably just be futile anyway."

Walking toward the tent village, the apothecary looked back at Shirone and said, "And kid, everything I said was made up. It's admirable that you broke me, but if you can't even notice that much, you'll get beaten badly on the mainland."

Arin spoke through the mental channel.

—Shirone, should I verify if it was a lie?

—No, it's fine.

Shirone watched the lonely figure of the apothecary walking away.

Norse Refuge.

A place where wanderers of Purgatory came to rest.

Perhaps what they briefly set down here wasn't their weary bodies, but the wounds of their hearts.

The spectacular shopping came to an end.

Shirone comforted Kanya, who couldn't hold back her tears. Beside them, Rena watched with puffed cheeks.

Amy's group began a meeting, excluding Shirone.

The items purchased with three white elixirs were a fire spirit, a drone, and Epiness.

Though it was the best under the circumstances, they couldn't help feeling like they'd lost out. Especially Tess, who couldn't hide her guilty feelings.

"It's not my place to say since I was the one who begged you to buy it, but is it really okay? There must have been things that would help in combat. Especially Epiness—we bought it at an ridiculously high price."

"What does it matter? If we need things, we can hunt. There's no need to worry about what's past."

"Rian's right. And financial loss isn't the only kind of loss. Shirone used the elixirs most efficiently, and we should be satisfied with that."

Receiving Amy's comfort, Tess made a tearful face.

"What good is efficiency? The situation was a mess. I support Shirone's choice too, but if the apothecary hadn't pulled those strange tricks, we could have gotten the drone for half price."

Canis smiled mockingly and said, "That's not what Amy meant. Actually, Shirone didn't suffer any loss at all. He bought something that couldn't be obtained even if we gave all the white elixirs."

"What? Was the fire spirit that expensive?"

"No. The most expensive thing was Epiness."

Tess thought Canis, who wasn't even close to her, was joking.

Speaking of which, the thought of buying something that could have been purchased with a red elixir using a white elixir was enough to make her bolt upright even from sleep.

Rian asked in incomprehension, "Why is Epiness the most expensive? That's a common medicine."

"That's true, but today its value transcended imagination. Most importantly, it's about the owners of that item. Kanya and Rena. In other words, they're divine subjects of heaven."

"Ah..."

"Do you understand now? It's not about the Epiness. Shirone bought a ticket to heaven with one white elixir."

Indeed, that was true.

Come to think of it, their method of entering heaven had been uncertain. But now they had something to rely on. With Kanya's help, they could enter heaven.
