Still, what bothered him was that it sounded like Shirone had used her.

"Shirone isn't that kind of person! Even if Kanya hadn't been a divine subject, he would have helped her just the same! Shirone is kind and also...!"

"I know what kind of person he is. That's exactly why."

When Canis readily acknowledged this, Tess had nothing left to say.

"He would have genuinely given the White Elixir. So what I want to say is this: while Shirone may have acted with good intentions, he's also not stupid enough to not consider this much in that situation. Right?"

The group couldn't argue.

If it was Shirone, there was no way he wouldn't know what Canis had thought of. Then he must be forming some kind of strategy. Just then, Shirone walked over with Kanya.

Kanya bowed her head and said, "I'm sorry you had to lose out because of me. I won't forget this kindness."

Amy glanced at Shirone behind her shoulder with her eyes. As expected, he seemed to know and shook his head.

Sometimes in life, good intentions are seen as calculations, and that was Shirone's situation now. He didn't want to hurt Kanya, so he wanted to wait and see a little longer.

Opinions were exchanged through the mental channel. Canis said he would speak, but it was decided by majority vote to leave it to Shirone.

After the meeting ended, Amy and Kanya were absorbed in examining the fire spirit and drone.

Watching them, Shirone realized that among the party's women, only Arin had received nothing.

"Sorry. I used up all the elixir."

Canis said, "I don't need it. I didn't come here just to get something like this."

Tess, who had been petting the drone, flared up. "What? Say that again."

"I don't need it. I didn't come here just to get something like this."

As Tess ground her teeth, Canis added, "We didn't risk our lives coming here just to wander around Purgatory. You should consider that the drone you're hugging is equipment that anyone carries around in Heaven."

Canis was right.

If Purgatory was a market that sold goods, then Heaven was a factory that manufactured them. This could be understood just from the fact that all principles of this world originated from Heaven's laws.

Tess pouted and turned away.

Anyway, the drone was hers. Even if there were amazing things in Heaven, if she couldn't get them, they'd be pie in the sky, wouldn't they?

She felt better again and petted the drone. Then she suddenly became curious about how to use it.

She was afraid it might break, so she didn't handle it roughly, but no matter how much she shook it or tapped it, there was no sign of it working.

"Kanya, how do you use this? You said it was definitely new, but it won't work."

"Let me see. I'll take a look."

Kanya took the drone and turned it this way and that. Then she saw a steel band tied around the drone's flight mechanism and made a troubled expression.

She also knew that the drone had been bought with a White Elixir. But she never imagined they would sell such a thing. Mecca race equipment with the band not removed was utterly useless.

"Um... this can't be used."

"What? Why? Is it broken somewhere?"

"No, it's actually the opposite. This is a brand new product straight from the factory. See the pattern carved on this steel band? This is called Hena, and the seal must be broken to use it. But the seal can only be broken at the factory. That's why it can't be used."

Tess looked like she was about to cry. The item she had paid a White Elixir for was the same as a lump of scrap metal.

Listening to the conversation, Shirone realized why the merchant had been so eager to sell the item at any cost. He hadn't mentioned the seal.

Amy snatched the drone away, saying, "Give it here. I'll go get a refund. They sold defective goods without even explaining! This is fraud!"

"That's right. I committed fraud."

The merchant who had sold the drone approached with Clove.

Since he readily admitted it, Amy was deflated.

The group calmed their anger and waited for the merchant's next words. But he said nothing. Instead, he took out three Yellow Elixirs from his pocket.

"What is this?"

"The original price of the drone. Of course, I've deducted the profit, but no matter what auction you hold, you couldn't sell it cheaper than this. All Mecca items have locking mechanisms. I'm sorry for not telling the truth."

Arin confirmed it was true.

Amy guessed why the merchant had made this confession of conscience. First, it was obvious fraud, and seeing Shirone's abilities, he concluded that things would escalate.

In the end, he wanted to clean things up and at least secure his original share. For a merchant, he was quite spineless.

"Don't look at me like that. I have no ulterior motives."

"Then why are you returning it?"

"As an apology. I felt miserable. I escaped from Heaven and came to Purgatory, but I lived believing there was hope. I don't want to abandon even a merchant's pride."

Shirone nodded understandingly and accepted the Yellow Elixirs. Arin informed him it was half truth, half lie, but he was sick of fighting over marbles now.

The merchant offered his own consolation. "It's not even that much of a discount anyway. Usually, ten Yellow Elixirs can get you one White Elixir. That's how valuable drones are in Purgatory."

Tess shot back, "So what? We can't use it anyway."

The merchant had nothing to say about that. Mecca race equipment wasn't even his main product line, and he had just happened to acquire it, so he lacked information.

But Amy got a hint from the merchant's words.

"If it's valuable, doesn't that mean there's a way to unlock it?"

Tess looked back with a glimmer of hope, but the merchant just shrugged as if he didn't know.

Listening to their conversation, Canis sighed.

He was annoyed at the situation where they were worrying despite having the key to the locking mechanism right in front of them. Should he tell them or not?

Finally, displaying a trace of camaraderie, he spoke up.

"Do you guys really not know?"

"Huh? Don't know what?"

"Remember how we got here. If you have brains, use them to think."

Tess recalled her memories. They had escaped to Heaven through Guffin's Door. Guffin's Door? Wait, what did we do at Guffin's Door?

Tess turned to Shirone and shouted, "Shirone! Quick, quick, unlock this!"

Shirone realized it too.

Guffin's Door was also a kind of ancient weapon. Its exterior was nothing more than a stone wall, but when Immortal Function was activated, it became a weapon that transformed into a dimensional door. Perhaps the nickname "Unlocker" came from this.

Taking the drone, Shirone held it with both hands and concentrated. Would it work? He had doubts, but expected it would work eight or nine times out of ten.

When Immortal Function was activated, the drone began to emit light. The merchant's eyes widened as he watched.

Red patterns appeared along the locking mechanism called Hena. The form was different, but it was exactly the same phenomenon he had seen at Guffin's Door.

With a ting sound, the Hena fell away and light leaked through the gaps in the assembly.

Shirone held up the drone with a bright smile.

"Wow, this really works?"

With his smiling face unchanged, Shirone's body froze.

Countless Norse people were looking this way. Not only Kanya and Rena, but even Guardlak and Clove had shocked, dazed expressions.

He thought it was simply because he had broken the seal, but he could hear whispering from somewhere.

When Arin attempted telepathy on several people, their voices entered his head.

Nephilim.

Many words were exchanged, but the common word was Nephilim.

As the voices grew louder, Shirone became more anxious.

He couldn't tell if the word Nephilim had a good or bad meaning.

Arin said their emotions were awe and fear.

Kanya, who met Shirone's eyes, started in surprise. But remembering that even this was irreverent, she knelt down.

"Ra's divine subject pays respects to the Nephilim."

Shirone couldn't grasp how the situation was unfolding.

Then Guardlak approached. He had a more serious face than when they were being chased by heretic hunters.

"You weren't those who fell into Purgatory. You were those who opened the door and entered."

"I don't understand what you mean. What exactly is a Nephilim?"

"In this world, only angels can freely travel between Heaven and the earthly realm. They have various missions, but among them is impregnating individuals who will edify the land. It must be a virgin who has never had a child, and that's called virgin conception. Nephilim refers to descendants born between angels and virgins. In Heaven, Nephilim are called this: those free from the law."

Shirone recalled the priestesses that the Kergo chieftain had brought to the banquet. Only virgins could bear children of angel descendants.

Still, what he didn't understand was that he wasn't a Nephilim. If he really was a descendant of angels, why did his mother abandon him?

Moreover, being called a Nephilim just because Immortal Function was possible seemed flawed.

If all the unlockers in the world came from one bloodline, scholars would have discovered it.

"Nephilim are outside Ra's will. But divine subjects follow Nephilim. Because they stand at the highest position humans can reach."

Shirone didn't like it. Just because ancestors were great didn't mean divine subjects should follow, did it?

Also, Immortal Function was a realm realized through challenges. It felt absurd to attribute his unique achievement, which he was proud of, to bloodline merit.

"Forget it. Anyway, knowing such facts doesn't change anything, does it?"

"That's true. This is a land of heretics after all. But why did you come to Purgatory? Did you come to carry out an angel's mission?"

Shirone guessed what an angel's value was. They were a means of communication that connected gods and divine subjects by passing through dimensions.

"Yes. We came to enter Heaven. We have something to convey."

"I thought so. But why did you come to Norse Refuge?"

"That just happened..."

When Shirone looked back, Kanya turned her reddened face away.

Her heart was pounding. Shirone wasn't a heretic or impostor to be rejected. He was a great Nephilim who had defeated the unicorn beast and obtained Epiness for her.

Shirone calmed Kanya down.

"You don't need to be so nervous. Actually, I didn't even know I was a Nephilim. Just treat me comfortably."

"But... how..."

Amy approached and helped. Shirone's words were right, but she felt strangely uncomfortable.

"That's right, be comfortable. Even if Shirone is a Nephilim, the other friends are heretics. We get along comfortably with Shirone, so you don't need to do that, right?"

Kanya didn't think so.

Those traveling with a Nephilim couldn't be classified as heretics. They were connected to the Nephilim, and the Nephilim was connected to angels.

Anyway, since she couldn't refuse what the higher laws said, Kanya decided to treat him comfortably according to Shirone's wishes. But there was still a great resonance spreading in her heart.

Nephilim or whatever, Tess didn't care. Shirone was Shirone.

She grinned and examined the drone. Just the humming sound made her heart race.

Kanya approached and held out her hand.

"Give it here. I'll teach you how to use it."

The drone was remote control equipment that used human brains as control towers. Using advanced technology called retinal vision, it transmitted information directly to the user's eyes, and depending on atmospheric conditions, it could fly up to a 10-kilometer radius from the control tower.

"To use the drone, you need to set a personal password. It uses unique frequencies, and only Mecca technicians know the principle. Anyway, to use it, press here and then like this..."

When she placed her hand on the initialization button, the hemispherical drone split into various components.

When she put it on Tess's head, it made mechanical sounds and tightened, then began reading her brainwaves.
