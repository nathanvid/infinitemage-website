After 30 seconds passed, a signal appeared indicating the save was complete.

The drone that had scanned both eyes sent a signal to the left eye.

Tess was so shocked she nearly stopped breathing. The landscape the drone was seeing was overlaid on what she could see with her own eyes.

This ability alone was worth the value of a Schema.

Tess removed the drone and attached it to her gauntlet, nodding repeatedly as she listened to the explanation.

Kanya informed her that it also had language decoding functions, and if specific brainwaves were stored, it could track radio waves and automatically find targets.

Unlike Sirone's group, who were excited about the combat enhancement, Clove rolled his eyes anxiously.

Even to heretics, the word Nephilim was powerful.

This was different from the fear felt toward strong enemies. The Nephilim represented an unknown terror unrelated to the level of force.

Recalling the attitude they had shown him so far, he hoped Sirone wouldn't place some strange curse on him.

Sure enough, Sirone approached him.

Contrary to his thoughts of being helplessly victimized, Sirone took out a yellow elixir and placed it in his hand.

It was a fee.

Clove agonized for a while before putting it in his pocket.

"Th-thank you. You didn't need to give me this much."

"It's fine. I can't split an elixir anyway."

"Are you... really a Nephilim?"

"I don't know. I'm just a magic school student. No matter what the people here call me, that fact won't change."

"I'm sorry for being harsh to you. I thought you were one of the people from the ground..."

"Even if I were from the ground, you shouldn't treat people that way."

"Y-you're right. I'm sorry."

Sirone didn't want to talk anymore.

Lecturing someone who had succumbed to fear was meaningless. Even if you told a cockroach to bow, it would comply.

Sirone stopped paying attention to Clove and went to where the Norse were gathered. Since this was also part of the community, he figured he might as well ask around.

"Excuse me, do you know anything about a woman named Miro?"

The Norse looked puzzled.

Just as Sirone was about to give up and turn away, an old man with a walking stick approached.

"Miro, did you say Miro?"

"Yes. Do you know her?"

"I heard about her when my parents were alive. Could she also be a Nephilim?"

"Huh? Oh, yes."

The people of this world knew Unlockers as Nephilim. Though he didn't know Miro's exact origins, she was also an Unlocker, so it seemed safe to confirm.

"She denied Ra's law."

"What... does that mean?"

"I don't know. That's all I heard. But my mother didn't hate her. Even though she was a divine subject who followed Ra so devotedly. It was shocking to me as a child."

A woman who denied Ra's law. The information was simple, but upon reflection, it conveyed much.

First, Miro had definitely come to heaven. And she must have realized far more about this world than he had before returning.

And such a woman had denied Ra.

What judgment would he make when this journey ended? Would he come to understand Miro, or would he deny her?

While he was lost in thought, Amy approached.

"Sirone, the sun looks like it's setting. We decided to sleep here tonight, what do you think?"

"Hm? That's fine with me too. I'm tired from fighting since morning. Let's rest from now on."

"Um..."

Kanya approached and spoke. Amy could tell just from her expression. Seeing how she had followed them, she was definitely concerned about her relationship with Sirone.

"What is it? Do you have something to say to me?"

"I taught Tess how to use the drone."

"Ah, I see. Thank you."

"Rena and I will also sleep here tonight. The guides rest at this time. We'll probably leave tomorrow morning."

"Ah... I see."

Sirone left a trailing note in his voice.

If Kanya was leaving tomorrow morning, they would definitely have to follow then too. But the problem was that nothing had been agreed upon.

Kanya, who had been gauging Amy's reaction, spoke.

"You said you were entering heaven, right? If it's okay, could you stop by our house for just one day?"

Though he had been thinking of going to heaven, staying at Kanya's house was a different matter entirely.

It might be because of her mother who didn't have much time left. She might have felt like introducing the Nephilim to her parents who were devout divine subjects.

In any case, there was no reason to refuse. He was just grateful for her kindness in accepting his goodwill.

When Sirone agreed, Kanya blushed.

Amy didn't like that part, but she couldn't timidly pick a fight about it, so she snorted and went to Tess.

While wrapping up the day's activities, the outskirts of Norse Refuge became noisy. A group came running, shouting loudly.

"It's a patrol! Hide! Get down on the ground!"

Without time to ask what was happening, the Norse scattered in all directions.

Sirone grabbed Kanya's hand and ran to where Gardlock was. His friends seemed to have made the same judgment as they were gathering there too.

Lying prone in the bushes, Sirone heard the full story from Gardlock.

He said that when the moon waxed to full, angels would patrol around Purgatory.

The reason and purpose were unclear, but it was a revelation that had been passed down among heretics for thousands of years.

A sound that shook the world could be heard from the sky. The surrounding air vibrated as if tens of thousands of locusts had gathered.

As each sound layered, the discord disappeared and a single melody pierced through their ears.

Was it a stringed instrument that made the most beautiful sound in the world?

Sirone lost himself in delusion.

Gardlock pulled Sirone's consciousness back from outside awareness.

"Get a hold of yourself! Don't get drawn into the sound! We can endure it because we're mages, but other species would have already collapsed."

Sirone checked on Tess and Rena. They were kneeling and crying. Though they hadn't lost consciousness, they were already in another world.

What exactly was this sound? Could a single tone shake people's minds like this?

"Where is the sound coming from?"

"Each angel has their own unique vibration. It's a vibration emitted by their very existence."

"Vibration of existence itself? How is that possible?"

"In heaven, angels are called harmonizers of law. As the first entities of causality, they take precedence over all laws. Vibration is the tremor that proves an angel's unique domain."

Sirone looked up at the sky. Judging by the vibration's frequency, it seemed they would soon pass over Norse Refuge.

Though they had put up a barrier with light magic, he couldn't shake his uneasiness.

"Could the angels see us?"

"They might, or they might not."

"What do you mean? Can they see us or not?"

"Have you ever checked your fingerprints today?"

"No."

"It's a similar situation. If they wanted to, they could easily see through the light barrier. But they don't fly around the vast Purgatory that way. As long as they don't act whimsically today, nothing should happen."

Someone shouted "They're coming!" from the bushes on the outskirts.

Sirone raised his head. He could see four silhouettes passing overhead at high speed.

He couldn't even blink.

An angel in white robes was flying in the lead. It spread wings of light ten times larger than its body and held a golden blade in its hand. Most strikingly captivating was the sphere of light floating above its head.

The beings forming a triangular formation around the angel were creatures he had never seen before.

Those guarding the left and right sides resembled humans but had red and blue skin.

Following behind them was a monster that seemed to combine all sorts of creatures.

Above their heads floated elongated red triangular lights like horns, varying in number from one to three each. Despite not being cones, they maintained the same shape from any angle.

"What are those monsters at the end? I could see octopus tentacles and snake faces."

"Those are Mara. The second entities of causality. Another name for them is executors of law."

"Executors of law?"

"I said angels are harmonizers of law. They are the first individuality created by God and have the right to freely interpret God's will. Do you know what this means? They can manipulate laws at will. They're on a different dimension from giants. When angels harmonize laws, Mara act. That's why Mara are called executors of law."

Sirone realized he had encountered the highest class of this world.

If God was the law, then angels were the judges.

Then wouldn't Mara be something like assistants who carry out the judges' orders?

"There was something floating above their heads. The angel had a sphere and the Mara had horn-like things..."

"Right, horns. Though they're not real horns but thought-forms. The more horns, the higher-ranking the Mara. They're granted unique abilities from birth. The horns are the source of that power."

"Then what about what's on the angel's head?"

"That's called a sacred light body. It's no exaggeration to say an angel's power lies in their sacred light body. I don't know the details about the principle. Even when I was a divine subject, I could count on one hand how many times I saw angels."

Clove said with a trembling jaw.

"Actually, I see them more often here."

Sirone was gripped by a strange feeling.

If angels actually exist, are Unlockers really Nephilim? Could the power to freely traverse dimensions, Miro's Scale magic, be angelic abilities?

His head began to ache.

From the first day of arriving in heaven, he had gained countless pieces of information, but the puzzle board was too large to guess the whole picture.

Not long after the angels left, the moon rose.

It was a gigantic moon that seemed touchable from a mountaintop if there were mountains. It was eerie.

After the angels' patrol ended, the Norse's day came to a close.

Sirone rented a 12-person barracks from the tent village and lay down alongside his friends.

Perhaps tired, gentle breathing could be heard from here and there. Though he wanted to think more, he could feel his physical functions declining.

Without knowing it, Sirone fell asleep and met Miro in his dreams. It wasn't a nightmare.

**Wine of Tales (1)**

Sirone's group followed Gardlock and arrived at the whirlpool serpent's valley.

Since the law had been broken, it could no longer be called the whirlpool serpent's valley, but a name maintained for tens of thousands of years wouldn't disappear easily.

Gardlock said they would no longer be able to find guides in this place.

With the whirlpool serpent gone, there was a possibility that a new law would enter. Whatever law it might be, it wouldn't be favorable to them.

"We'll be able to see someday. Laws are finite, but humans are infinite. Even if heaven perishes, Norse Refuge won't disappear."

Gardlock said this and vanished.

The words that humans are infinite touched Sirone's heart. Even in this place tens of thousands of light-years away, humans were living.

The group sent three drones into the sky.

Having experienced Kergo's heretic hunting, the importance of reconnaissance had grown even more.

When Sirone asked about heaven, Kanya kindly explained, unlike when they first met.

"Heaven consists of seven heavens. From the Seventh Heaven Arabot to the First Heaven Shamain. Divine subjects reside in the First Heaven Shamain. Three races—Mecca, Norse, and Kergo—keep the laws and do their assigned work. When Kergo produces, Mecca processes and Norse supplies."

"But isn't that unreasonable? Having your work determined from birth."

"We've been doing this for hundreds of thousands of years already. We simply act according to the laws of Anke Ra."

As far as Sirone knew, civilization in the original world had emerged at most 10,000 years ago. If heaven had existed for hundreds of thousands of years, population saturation should have been normal, social problems aside.

When Sirone voiced such thoughts, Kanya tilted her head in puzzlement.

"Having such doubts is impious. Anke Ra governs the world. The population of Shamain has never once decreased or increased. The population count is always the same."

"How can that be? Is it like a birth control policy?"

"Those who keep and follow the laws gain eternal life. They can enter the Third Heaven Shehaqim and live forever."

"Then those who don't gain eternal life die?"
