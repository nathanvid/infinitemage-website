"No. Even if their lifespan ends, the divine subjects of Heaven don't die. They're reborn as new life through the wine of tales."

"Then the math doesn't add up. If everyone can live forever, why does the population stay the same?"

"The lifespan of divine subjects is under Ra's jurisdiction. Because the entire population's lifespan is calculated through strict laws, it can maintain a fixed number."

Eternal life and population control were contradictory concepts.

In the end, the key lay in the wine of tales.

But just like Gadrak, Kanya also avoided explaining it. Whether divine subjects or heretics, they all had their own convictions, but when it came to the wine of tales, that didn't seem to apply.

Contradiction.

The wine of tales that Shirone imagined was a massive contradiction.

They passed through the Valley of the Whirlpool Serpent and the Forest of the Vulgar before arriving at Heaven.

The group craned their necks up to the sky.

Compared to the size of the fortress walls, they were nothing more than specks of dust. It was an extreme scale that humans could never create.

Kanya introduced this place as District 73 and added that there were 820 districts in the First Heaven alone.

Giving up on imagination, Shirone touched the wall. He thought it was stone, but it was metal.

Heaven's technological prowess transcended the common sense of Shirone's group.

"Will it be okay for us to enter?"

"It should be fine. You're Nephilim, after all. But I can't guarantee it."

"Then how about we climb over the walls instead?"

The thought of climbing walls that touched the sky seemed impossible, but there were no other options.

However, Kanya shook her head at that idea too.

"Only drones with flight approval can fly in Heaven's airspace. You'd be shot down. It's never happened before, but I heard it from my grandfather long ago. And anyway, sneaking in is impossible."

"Why? There doesn't seem to be anyone guarding the gate."

"They don't restrict entry and exit. It's a matter of law. Information about what happens in Heaven is managed by Jebul in the Sixth Heaven where angels reside. They can measure even the mass fluctuations of each district and the gas components mixed in the air, so even if you sneak in, it would be useless. Don't worry too much. Nothing dangerous will happen. This isn't Purgatory, after all."

Kanya, being a divine subject, reassured Shirone as if there was no need to plant negative feelings about Heaven in advance.

When they approached the gate and held out the gauntlet, a red beam shot out from the lens and scanned the surface.

As the gate opened, they heard a sound like the world shaking. Even covering their ears was useless.

When the entrance to District 73 opened, Shirone's group followed behind Kanya and entered Heaven.

As the gate closed, the lens flashed.

The newly changed information of District 73 was transmitted to Jebul in the Sixth Heaven.

Total mass: 49,739,498,847.3423 kilograms.

Carbon dioxide generation increased by 0.0000024 percent.

The first impression of Shamain was alien.

The residential areas of different races were divided with pathways between them, and their cultural styles were extremely different.

While the Norse buildings were practical, the Kergo buildings were luxurious. And when they discovered the Mecca buildings, Shirone and Amy stopped walking and were left speechless.

It was Istas, the magic warehouse.

Square boxes were stacked in layers, freely crossing and changing positions with the adjacent buildings.

It didn't seem likely that the Mecca had come on a field trip to a magic school. It was evidence that Mecca technology had somehow flowed into their original world.

Kanya passed through the Mecca district and emerged into the plaza.

The plaza scene, where various races mingled like a cultural bridgehead, looked like an international market in a neutral country.

"Shirone, look over there."

Amy pointed to a giant's statue.

The feeling was different from when they saw it at the Kergo altar. Giants actually lived here. They had even fought battles.

Why was the giant, revered by the divine subjects, wandering Purgatory?

Kanya's house was the same size as other Mecca houses.

If Kergo pursued ostentation and Norse practicality, then Mecca seemed to pursue standardization.

When they entered Kanya's house, the building rose to four stories.

Unlike its inhuman exterior, the interior was cozy.

The parents sitting at the dining table jumped up.

He had heard that the wine of tales targeted those whose lifespans were ending, but their faces were much younger than Shirone had expected.

Kanya's mother pulled her two daughters into her arms and shouted.

"Where on earth have you been? Do you know how worried mother was?"

"Sorry. There were circumstances."

"Who are those children? They look like Norse."

"I went to Norse Refuge. To get this."

When Kanya held out the potion, her mother's eyes shook with shock.

She had never told anyone. So how did her daughter know about this?

"You... this is..."

"It's a stimulant, made with Norse magic. Drink this before the wine of tales."

"Rena! Why did you do such a thing? Mother never wanted this!"

"Then should I just watch and do nothing? You also went to Purgatory once to give grandfather medicine!"

"Who on earth told you such things...!"

"Grandfather told me! That's why grandfather could smile until the end and enter the wine of tales! That was enough! That's what family is!"

"Why are you really acting like this! Then you must also know that mother's lifespan was shortened while trying to get medicine! How do you think mother feels when her daughter does the same thing!"

The father, who had been listening with a somber expression, interrupted.

"Both of you, stop. It's spilled milk now. At least you returned safely."

After stopping his wife, he looked at Shirone's group.

"So are you heretics from Norse Refuge?"

Kanya introduced Shirone's group.

"No. They came from the land country. They saved Rena and my lives and helped us get this medicine. If it weren't for them, we might have died."

No parent in the world could treat coldly those who had saved their daughter's life.

The father invited Shirone's group into the house.

While the mother prepared a meal, Kanya told them about what happened in Purgatory.

When the story came up that Shirone was Nephilim, both parents knelt down, making the living room noisy.

Only after the group's earnest requests did the parents agree to treat them comfortably.

"I see. Thank you for helping Kanya and Rena. But you should leave this place quickly. Even if you're Nephilim, they won't welcome those from the land country."

"No. We're thinking of going to the Seventh Heaven."

Arabot, God's holy land, was so sacred that even saying you would go there was blasphemous. But Shirone was free from the law, so he could freely speak whatever came to mind.

"But... there's no way to reach the Seventh Heaven."

"We'll have to think about that from now on. More than that, I'm curious about the laws here. What do you mean by lifespan being shortened?"

"Exactly what it sounds like. Divine subjects are given lifespans according to the law from birth. Kanya's lifespan is 62 years. Rena can live until 73."

"Huh? Rena is the younger sister but has a longer lifespan?"

"Lifespans can change anytime. Rena gained an additional 10 years of life as a child for singing hymns beautifully. It's a good thing, but the problem is my wife. My wife's lifespan is 43 years and 247 days. Now there's only one day left."

Shirone felt his heart drop.

What person in the world would know their lifespan down to one day? If it were him, just imagining it would be horrible.

Even so, Kanya's mother was smiling. Because she was certain that Ra's grace would descend.

"My wife had 20 years of her lifespan cut for the sin of going to Purgatory in her youth. So tomorrow she'll enter the wine of tales."

Changing a person's lifespan was a cruel thing. No, he couldn't even think it was possible.

If Ra controlled lifespans, how old was he?

They said Heaven's history spanned hundreds of thousands of years. Perhaps Ra really was a god.

"What is this wine of tales?"

"Hmm, they didn't tell you, I see. Well, that would be the case. It's nothing good to know about. Above all, aren't Nephilim free from the law? It has nothing to do with you."

"Still, I want to know. If I understand what it is, maybe a good solution will come to mind."

"Hmm, if that's the case..."

Just as the father was about to speak, a clear voice rang out from outside the window.

"All bow before me! I am Phoebe, administrator of the Mecca race."

Shirone's group jumped up.

Like sound amplification magic, the voice was reaching them here. Most surprising was that the language was being automatically translated.

The ability of telepathy cast through sound alone without going through channels.

If it was magic, it was high difficulty.

"What was bound to come has finally come. A fairy."

"A fairy? The fairy I know of?"

Shirone thought of the fairy race living in his original world.

Kanya's father, mistaking that he was talking about the fairies here, nodded.

"Yes. Those who execute the law. If giants uphold the law, then fairies are beings who execute the law. You could call them administrators. She must have come about Kanya and Rena's matter."

"What should we do?"

"If you're Nephilim, you shouldn't need to worry. You're free from the law. However... I don't know if she'll take that into consideration. She has a peculiar personality."

"What are you doing! The divine subjects of this house, open the door at once!"

The fairy's voice was heard from outside the door.

This was the fourth floor. And the fairies Shirone knew were definitely not beings that could fly.

When the father opened the door, contrary to Shirone's expectations, a cute creature flew in.

It was a girl the size of a palm.

She had curly blonde hair, and even on her small face, her features were distinct enough to see how pretty she was. She wore green boots that came up to her ankles, and transparent wings fluttered at invisible speed.

When Kanya's family knelt, Shirone's group followed suit, reading the situation.

Phoebe, floating in mid-air, lifted her chin and spoke.

"I am Phoebe, the Spiral Fairy. I have personally come to hold a divine subject trial."

Fairies were born from emotions like Jack O'Lanterns, but they were concepts rather than natural phenomena.

Single concept entities.

Therefore, fairies had reason and could control the concepts from which they originated.

"And so I shall now execute the law. Kanya and Rena, have you been to Purgatory?"

"Yes. We went and returned."

Kanya's parents squeezed their eyes shut.

But Kanya herself was calm. She had been prepared for this since before leaving Heaven.

The only concern was... Rena.

"I'm sorry. I wanted to serve delicious food to my mother who was facing the wine of tales, so I hunted in the Forest of the Vulgar."

Since Kergo could freely travel to and from Purgatory, she thought using hunting as an excuse might lighten the crime.

But Phoebe pressed her as if the circumstances of divine subjects were of no concern.

"Hmph, how dare you lie before me. What use is food to a divine subject who will die tomorrow?"

Kanya's mother finally showed tears.

Even if the wine of tales was a blessing, what creature in the world wouldn't fear death? Phoebe had stirred up those precarious emotions.

Shirone felt anger at that fact.

The divine subjects called the wine of tales rebirth. But the words from the administrative fairy were clearly a death sentence.

It wasn't simple intimidation, because he couldn't sense malice in Phoebe's words.

It was like an innocent child honestly expressing their feelings.

"Anyway, I shall pass judgment. Kanya and Rena, your lifespans are reduced by 40 years each."

Kanya looked stunned. A 40-year reduction meant she had less than 10 years of life left. Rena was in a better situation, but even so, she would end her life at 33.

Being sentenced to a 40-year reduction for unauthorized absence was the highest record she knew of.

A year ago, her peer Seil received a 5-year reduction. Uncle Kai, who was Norse, got 7 years. Even her mother, known for having the worst luck, only got 20 years.

But 40 years? She could accept it for herself, but what about Rena's life?
