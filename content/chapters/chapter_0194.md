"Lady Phoebe! Please forgive us! If you combine Rena's and my lifespans, that's an 80-year reduction. I'm the one who forced my sister into this. So please, at least lessen my sister's punishment!"

"What's wrong with 40 years? You can only live about 60 years at most anyway, right? Five years should be enough time to do whatever you want to do."

What determines biological characteristics is lifespan. Fairies possess reason like humans, but having such long lifespans, their way of thinking was completely different.

A fairy's life provides ample time to make up for mistakes. That's why they have no stubbornness and are honest, but they couldn't possibly understand the feelings of humans whose lifespans are limited.

Just as no human knows how precious one hour is to a mayfly.

Especially for Phoebe, who had only been born a year ago, death was merely a word she might consider a thousand years from now.

Kanya's mother prostrated herself flat on the floor. She knew the newly appointed domestic administrator was inexperienced, but she never dreamed he would pass such a devastating judgment.

"Lady Phoebe, you are an executor of the law. However, no one in the fairy realm has ever imposed such harsh punishment. Even I only received 20 years. Please reconsider."

"What? Are you disrespecting me just because I'm only one year old! I know everything I need to know! An executor of the law has the authority to pass judgment on up to 50 years of lifespan. Are you defying my inherent authority?"

"If you truly intend to pass such judgment, please give us a reason to accept it."

"Hmph, fine! Then I'll tell you this! Kanya and Rena's unauthorized departure from heaven is 20 years of lifespan reduction! And the remaining 20 years is for the crime of bringing in heretics! Are you satisfied now?"

Phoebe pointed at Shirone's group as she spoke. She hadn't received a report about heretics entering, but since she had confirmed it with her own eyes upon arriving here, there was no problem with passing judgment.

"Lady Phoebe! These people are not heretics! The boy here is a Nephilim."

"Wh-what, Nephilim?"

Phoebe stared intently at Shirone.

Was he really a Nephilim?

Descendant of angels. One free from the law. The source knowledge given at birth flashed through her mind.

Since fairies are not harmonizers of law, they can only impose crimes within established laws. Therefore, it was true that no punishment could be imposed on a Nephilim.

Nevertheless, Phoebe did not back down.

As the youngest among the 72 ranks of fairies, among 48,000 fairies, she recalled the verbal abuse she endured daily from her senior sisters. If she returned without establishing her authority here, she would become a laughingstock until the next youngest was born.

"Even so, the crime doesn't change! I'll let the Nephilim pass! But not everyone is a Nephilim! Therefore, the crime of bringing in heretics will still be prosecuted!"

Kanya's mother raised her head and retorted.

"They're not Nephilim, but they are companions of the Nephilim. Treating them as heretics goes against the law."

"Shut up! How dare a mere divine subject discuss law with an executor of the law! I am carrying out Ra's will. Opposing me is the same as opposing God!"

"Wait a moment."

As Shirone, who had been kneeling, stood up, Phoebe crossed her arms and turned to look at him.

Fighting a Nephilim wasn't a good thing, but even a Nephilim had no authority to interfere with the execution of law.

"What? If you're trying to obstruct the execution, I won't forgive you."

"No, I'm trying to correct a misunderstanding. We weren't brought here by that girl. We simply followed her. In that case, you can't hold that girl accountable, can you?"

"What are you talking about? Followed?"

"I discovered that girl by chance outside of heaven. I simply entered by following as she opened the door. Since I'm free from the law, I can go anywhere. That's why I barged into this house to have dinner. Therefore, those two sisters have done nothing wrong."

"Who do you think will believe such lies?"

"Then prove it. Show me evidence that what I'm saying is false."

The Mecca system within heaven catches even the smallest variables, but it cannot read emotions.

While countless pieces of information verified that Shirone's group entered together with Kanya, determining their relationship was impossible. All of this was happening because Shirone was a Nephilim.

Phoebe rolled her eyes back and forth.

She had to find another way somehow. If rumors spread that she had been played by humans, she would be a laughingstock for a thousand years.

"Fine. Then I restore Kanya and Rena's lifespans by 20 years. And I permit the Nephilim's entry as well. But the rest are clearly heretics who deny the law, so I will reduce their lifespans. You there, you first—tell me your name."

Phoebe pointed at Arin as she spoke.

Of course, Arin didn't answer.

Though she didn't know the exact cause and effect, it seemed that a name was absolutely necessary for the ability to grant lifespans. Arin wasn't foolish enough to openly write her name in a death register.

"I don't want to. Why should I tell you my name?"

"These creatures really! Being vulgar heretics, they don't know the fearsome power of fairies!"

Shirone made a displeased expression and spoke.

"What do you think human life is? You'll die someday too, won't you?"

"I'm a fairy. I'm incomparable to human lives! Besides, I've only lived for one year! I have so, so much time left before my lifespan ends."

Shirone snorted.

The future is the future precisely because it eventually arrives. That's why we respect those who lived before us and mourn them when they pass away.

Phoebe seemed not to realize that the concept of future has the immutable nature of destruction.

No, she probably had never even thought about it.

She said she was one year old. Compared to a human one-year-old, he could guess how immature she was.

Phoebe put her hands on her hips and spoke.

"Fine, so you want to play it this way? For the crime of not revealing your names, you will be judged by those higher than me. And Kanya and Rena, for the crime of harboring impious heretics, will have an additional 30 years added, making it a 50-year lifespan reduction for both!"

Kanya's family was devastated.

Fifty years—Kanya would die the moment the law was executed.

Since the actual execution of lifespans was carried out by the highest ranks of the 72 fairy grades, she wouldn't die immediately, but once the report went up, it was obvious that it would be processed within hours.

Having evaluated her own judgment, Phoebe turned her body as if she had performed difficult work today.

"That concludes the judgment. Well then, I'll be going."

Phoebe's flight toward the door stopped.

Rian and Tess were blocking the door. Shirone and Amy surrounded her from both sides.

"Hmm, are you trying to subdue me by force? Me, a fairy?"

"It's not impossible. Just think of it as catching a single sparrow."

"Really? Then try it."

Phoebe glared.

Then Rian, who was gripping the hilt of his greatsword, grimaced. A strange force was acting on him, twisting his arm. When Tess, not understanding the situation, grabbed Rian's shoulder, she too felt the same pain.

"Hoho! You'd better move quickly or it'll break."

The abilities of fairies, who are single concept entities, have much in common with irregular expressions. They use concepts by expanding them like magic.

Phoebe was born from spirals, and thus could dominate everything related to twisting. Even Rian, with his Schema user-level strength, found it difficult to endure.

But as his body began to execute his brain's commands 100 percent, he gradually began to move. When he swung his greatsword, Phoebe staggered as the spiral's power was broken.

Tess aimed for the opening and thrust her sabre.

Phoebe, who had flown up to avoid it, looked at her in disbelief.

Schema. It was the giants' technique.

Fairies and giants are the two pillars that maintain this world. Therefore, they are equal under the law, but each secretly believes they are superior. That's why being overwhelmed by giants' techniques in any situation was a blow to their pride.

"These creatures really!"

Phoebe moved fast enough to draw pictures with afterimages.

As Rian and Tess's movements overlapped, gaps in their movement occurred.

Targeting that moment, Phoebe unleashed spiral force on the door. The center of the iron door crumpled clockwise, breaking the hinges as the door panel fell off.

"Hahaha! Fools! Well then, goodbye!"

Phoebe, rushing toward the outside, felt something strange. For some reason, her speed was decreasing.

As Shirone approached from the front, she flew up to the ceiling, but even that was slow.

By the time she realized time was flowing slowly, she was already caught in Shirone's grasp.

Shirone released the slow and held Phoebe before his eyes. Her expression was blank.

"How did you manipulate time?"

Controlling time is light magic. But there was no light in the room that could be amplified with magic.

Source knowledge flashed through Phoebe's mind. Nephilim are descendants of angels. And angels are... rulers of light.

'Oh no...!'

Phoebe made a tearful face. She struggled to escape, but Shirone's grip was stronger.

No, it was that the fairy's strength was weak.

Fairies, specialized in mental power, had the lowest physical strength among the laws.

"Let go! Let me go!"

Phoebe's struggling wasn't even ticklish.

Then she gritted her teeth and cast magic. The moment spiral power was imbued, Shirone clenched his fist.

Phoebe's eyes widened as the air in her stomach burst out of her mouth.

"Haaaaah! Stop! My stomach's going to burst!"

"Restore the family's lifespans to their original state."

Phoebe's face, which had been sniffling with tears, turned cold.

"Hmph! Trying to threaten me? But it's useless. I'm the one who reports to the higher-ups, but I'm not the one who executes. Since you attacked an executor of the law, even if you're a Nephilim, you won't be safe. You'd better let me go quickly."

"Threaten? I could kill you."

If he couldn't change Phoebe's mind, Kanya would die. He couldn't say he bore no responsibility for that.

As he applied force to his grip, Phoebe's complexion turned pale. Even so, she didn't abandon her pride as an executor.

"K-kill me. I'm not scared at all."

The more he pressured Phoebe, the stronger her pulse felt.

She was a fragile life form. It seemed like he could crush her just for fun.

She was afraid.

"Not scared? Then why are you trembling?"

Mocked, Phoebe glared fiercely.

"The extinction of existence is frightening to everyone! Even knowing that fact, I choose death! Don't compare me to dim-witted humans like you!"

"Then die."

"Kill me! Kill me, I said! I can die anytime!"

Shirone lifted Phoebe up. If he slammed her to the ground, she would die instantly.

Phoebe's trembling grew stronger. Just imagining the small corpse with burst organs made him feel unpleasant.

Phoebe burst into pitiful tears.

Living for one year and then leaving. Even her dream of becoming number one among the 72 fairy ranks would end today.

As Phoebe's tears flowed down the back of his hand, Shirone frowned.

How should he accept this world where even essential values are dominated?

"Afraid yet still choosing death? Why? Why can you only think that way?"

"Hmph! A human like you wouldn't understand! But I won't say anything! As an executor of the law, I won't submit to humans!"

"I understand. If you've given up on life, you're already as good as dead, so I'll comfortably take your life."

Phoebe's face was covered with tears.

She wished he would spare her. But when someone who holds the power of life and death says they'll kill you, what should you answer?

Should she kneel and beg? An executor of the law submitting to divine subjects was something that must never happen.

"Yes! Kill me! Hurry up and kill me!"

"But if you ask me to spare you, I will."
