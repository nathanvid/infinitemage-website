Phoebe's face froze upon hearing Shirone's words.

She couldn't understand the phenomenon occurring within her heart. As hope for survival emerged, the strong emotions that had dominated her began to dissolve like bubbles.

"Are you mocking me? What could you possibly gain by humiliating me like this?"

"Mocking? Don't be ridiculous. It's only natural to save someone who asks to be saved. Because I too want to live. Since my life is precious, I understand how precious other people's lives are as well."

Shirone hadn't decided to let Phoebe go. What judgment he would make at the final moment remained uncertain.

However, he thought of Kanya and Rena. He couldn't let those two die like this.

"I'll count to three. One."

His grip on Phoebe tightened.

"Two."

"S-save me."

Phoebe spoke in a small voice.

Whether he hadn't heard or not, Shirone didn't relax his stance. Just as he was about to shout three, Phoebe squeezed her eyes shut and screamed.

"Save me! Please save me! I don't want to die!"

Shirone released Phoebe.

Having regained her freedom, she fluttered her wings and flew up. Her face reddened like sunset as she glared angrily.

"Do you think you'll be safe after doing this to me?"

"What did I do?"

"You tried to kill me!"

"That's right. And that's exactly what you did to Kanya and Rena."

Phoebe couldn't argue back.

Born as an enforcer of law, she had never deeply considered the lifespan of divine subjects.

But having her life in someone else's hands made her realize it was a complex matter.

Death is frightening and life is sweet. This was true even for fairies who lived ten thousand years.

"I think what happened to Kanya's mother was wrong too. Restore her lifespan as well."

Before she could organize her thoughts, the pressure came again, making Phoebe irritated.

"I told you before! Only the upper ranks of the 72 fairy hierarchies can touch the lifespan ledger. Cases that have already been judged cannot be reversed."

"Then start by re-judging Kanya and Rena's case. You can do that, right?"

Phoebe rested her chin on her hand, lost in thought.

"Well... I'll reduce their sentence to one year of lifespan deduction."

Shirone let out a hollow laugh.

While he was glad Kanya and Rena's punishment was lightened, the disparity in judgment was too great. It seemed there were no standards from the beginning.

"This isn't some junk dealer's shop. Can you really make judgments so arbitrarily?"

"I'm being generous by reducing it and you're still complaining! Should I raise it to twenty years instead?"

"That's not what I mean. Don't you think it's strange? There should be standards for applying punishment."

"That's why I am the standard. I'm the enforcer of law! You're really ignorant, aren't you?"

Shirone held his tongue. He had to accept that fairies were a different species that diverged from humans at some point.

Fairy thinking was more comprehensive than human thinking. While humans could break love down into countless concepts, to fairies love was simply love.

Phoebe was an enforcer of law, and therefore never doubted her own thoughts. Now that she knew how terrifying death was, one year deduction seemed appropriate.

It also made sense that she couldn't make detailed judgments like two years and three months, or seven years and six months.

Her thinking would deepen over thousands of years, but currently she was only one year old.

"Is that enough now? Then I'll be going. Fairies have a lot of work to do."

"Going where? You need to resolve Kanya's mother's situation too."

Phoebe turned to look at Shirone with narrowed eyes.

"How am I supposed to resolve that? I wasn't even born at the time. Besides, my position is the lowest of the 72 fairy hierarchies, so I don't have authority to modify the lifespan ledger."

"Then at least tell me a way. You're a fairy, so you must know something. I absolutely cannot let you go until you tell me."

Phoebe had a twisted nature befitting a spiral spirit, but being young made her not too difficult to handle. If he could extract information from her, there might be a way to save Kanya's mother.

"Hmph, do you think I can't leave just because you try to stop me? And no one can interfere with fairy realm affairs. That's established by law."

"I don't know what that law is, but you know it's unreasonable too, don't you? Life is precious. Is it okay to arbitrarily reduce someone's lifespan by twenty years?"

Phoebe's eyes welled up with tears.

The truth was, she didn't know either. To judge the right and wrong of law by personal standards, she would need to live at least six hundred years.

"Why do you keep picking on me? I'm just doing what I'm told!"

"When did you say you were an enforcer of law? You were so confident before, and now you're running away?"

"Ugh, really! What do you want me to do? What do you want to know?"

"First, tell me what the wine of tales is."

"Wine of tales? That's a sacred ritual. It's about refining the laws of divine subjects and being reborn as new life."

For the first time in a while, Phoebe answered fluently as if she knew something.

But Shirone couldn't sense anything from her words beyond packaged definitions.

"How am I supposed to understand when you explain it like that? Be specific. What purpose does it serve, how is it conducted, what are the ritual mechanisms, things like that."

"Ugh, this is really annoying..."

Phoebe grabbed her head with both hands.

Wine of tales was just wine of tales. She had never reflected on information she knew as fundamental knowledge.

There was only one method left.

Thinking of memory transference, her eyes lit up.

"If you really want to know, there's a way to explain it clearly. Using mental resonance. Fairies can transmit memories to others. I'll show you memories of the wine of tales I experienced. That should be enough, right?"

Mental resonance was dangerous. While Phoebe didn't seem likely to do anything malicious, she wasn't an ally either.

Arin spoke through the mental channel.

-It's fine. I can control someone like Phoebe.

-Are you sure? No matter how strong your defenses, there are irregular formulas too.

-Since Phoebe is emotionally immature, I should be able to read the unique patterns of irregular formulas with insight. Then I can knock her unconscious with mental shock before activation.

Canis's group seemed to have experienced irregular formulas as well.

Thinking that insight was truly incredible, Shirone conveyed his agreement to Phoebe.

"Alright. Show me the memories of wine of tales."

"Got it. Then I'll begin."

Phoebe cast the spell of memory transference.

As Shirone's group's minds were drawn into the memories, the scene of a plaza from a year ago appeared. It was the place where a giant statue stood, and the divine subjects weren't even breathing.

When Shirone called his friends who had arrived at different points, they approached like souls passing through the divine subjects.

Though it was someone else's memory, it was as vivid as reality.

Existing as a memory entity, Shirone could examine anything he wanted. It was fascinating that even putting his face right up to a divine subject's wouldn't be noticed.

Shirone's group headed toward where the statue stood.

As the barrier of crowds disappeared, an amazing scene unfolded.

Several hoses were connected to the giant statue, linked to eight glass spheres arranged around it. The glass spheres were large enough for a person to enter.

The divine subjects were silent, but some were crying. The scene mixed reverence with despair, creating unease.

Kergo people ran around the statue preparing the ritual. Eight divine subjects walked out from the crowd. Their ages were similar, in their 50s and 60s, but one was a young woman.

Shirone saw tears in their smiles.

Trembling pupils, quivering lips, cold sweat on their foreheads.

They were clearly thinking of death.

The subjects entered the glass spheres completely naked.

As black liquid filled the glass spheres, families rushed forward wailing. Meanwhile, other divine subjects prostrated themselves on the ground and began chanting Anke Ra.

Kergo people dragged away the families who were pounding on the glass, crying out "Mom, Dad, Grandfather."

The subjects submerged in the rising liquid smiled.

Was it drowning?

It was a cruel thing.

With that thought, Shirone peered inside the glass spheres and recoiled in horror.

It wasn't drowning. Their bodies were dissolving in the liquid.

It was the most bizarre sight he had ever witnessed.

He was curious about the liquid's composition and thought he knew why it was black. If families could have seen this process, they might have gone insane.

The liquid from the glass spheres was sucked up through the hoses. There was a disgusting sound like intestines spilling excrement.

The voices of divine subjects chanting Ra grew louder.

As the water level in the glass spheres lowered, the transparent interior was revealed again without a trace of residue.

There was nothing.

The people who had been smiling just moments before had been sucked out through the hoses.

Shirone turned his gaze to where the hoses were connected. His body was already trembling. Still, he had to see with his own eyes.

The giant statue.

There, into the bottom of the statue, eight people were pouring down.

Then what could it be? What was now filling the statue?

The eternal and immortal Ra.

The sound of praising Anke Ra pierced the sky.

Suddenly the giant statue vibrated strongly.

At that moment, the divine subjects closed their mouths.

Not a drop of water remained in the glass spheres. Everything had been filled into the giant statue.

Like a mold.

Shirone shook his head. That couldn't be. But once the thought arose, it couldn't be stopped.

A mold filled by melting humans. Then what was being created inside was...

The giant statue opened, showing its cross-section.

A massive foot emerged and shook the ground.

Shirone shuddered at the sight of the giant covered in jelly-like substance. Its expression was too distorted to call it human.

Through the mental channel, Arin muttered. The reason they couldn't achieve mental resonance with the giant was because multiple minds were mixed together in one body.

Then what state were the minds contained in that body?

Were they the minds of eight people, or something completely different?

The divine subjects begged for mercy.

Born from law and keeping law. The giant.

Therefore, the giant had the right to execute those who broke the law.

Even if someone was crushed under the giant's foot at this moment, it wouldn't be the giant's fault.

People who made eye contact with the giant foamed at the mouth and collapsed. It was the eye technique called Pressing.

Ah.

Shirone trembled.

The origin of Schema. The primordial Schema was the phenomenon of overlapping human body diagrams mixed by wine of tales.

Following behind the giant, they eavesdropped on the divine subjects' conversation.

The giant would leave heaven like this and enter Purgatory. There it would execute heretics threatening heaven, then receive Ra's call again to return to Fifth Heaven Matei.

Families cried out with tears.

Mom! Dad! Grandfather!

As if responding to their voices, the giant flinched. But it didn't turn around, and continued walking toward the gates as if nothing had happened.

@

Phoebe's memory scenery burned away like paper on fire, and the house scenery came back to life.

Shirone's group looked around.

Phoebe was nowhere to be seen. It seemed she had escaped while the memories were playing.

But having learned what wine of tales was, they had no time to worry about that.

Wine of tales subjects were decomposed in the liquid. Then they entered molds and went through a special metamorphosis process before being reborn as giants. People's minds were mixed together, and Schema occurred in that process.

The stimulant Kanya had purchased had that meaning.

It was a hope to maintain even a little consciousness in the unknown darkness.

Gardrak was right. It was no different from administering anesthesia to a patient dying in pain.

"This can't be..."

Tess's face was deathly pale.

The giant's ability Schema. And her own ability Schema.

When her thoughts reached that point, she ran to a corner and retched. The food she had eaten earlier spilled out.

No one criticized Tess.

Everyone felt nauseous.

When Rian approached, Tess raised her hand to stop him.

Of course, Phoebe's memories weren't more nauseating than battlefield scenes. But mental vomit was surging.

Schema was the giant's technique. But then why could she open Schema? Was there a separate giant bloodline like the Nephilim? But giants had no reproductive organs.

"Now you understand why I didn't tell you."

Kanya muttered with a sad expression.

Some called it a blessing, some called it a curse.

About this event that even divided opinions between divine subjects and heretics, no one wanted to speak of it.

"According to law, humans were born from giants. So returning to being giants again. That's wine of tales."

Even if Kanya's words were true, it was unacceptable. The wine of tales that Shirone witnessed was a monster whose true nature couldn't be hidden by any makeup.

Finally, they had to realize it.

The wine of tales conducted in heaven was a ritual that used human flesh and organs as raw materials to mold giants.
