Wine of tales.

A spell technique that melts humans to create giants.

In the concept of merging multiple entities into one, there was no room for biological dignity.

Living beings spread their offspring. However, heaven's sorcery went against such biological structure.

They controlled the divine subjects' lifespans through the lifespan registry, and when the population increased, they integrated individuals into giants to maintain the population count.

If this was Ra's will, then the wine of tales could be called the core system that maintained heaven.

Shirone's group gathered around the table and began their meeting. Having encountered heaven's cruel mindset, the tension had risen considerably.

First was the matter of Phoebe's treatment.

If she, who had left during the memory transfer, reported to higher authorities, even Kanya's house wouldn't be safe.

"We need to leave immediately. Phoebe will come back with more forces."

Canis was on the side of taking action.

Though Phoebe's abilities weren't exceptional, it was also true that she was only one year old.

Since they didn't know what abilities other fairies might possess, it was better to avoid combat.

"You don't need to worry too much. Shirone is a Nephilim. According to the law, Nephilim are not affected by the law. The fairies won't harm Shirone."

Kanya, being a divine subject, believed in the law with unwavering faith. But no one responded to her words.

What they had learned since coming here was that Nephilim weren't omnipotent. While they were certainly free from heaven's laws, the backlash when they interfered with those laws was severe because of that very freedom.

"Shirone, you decide. We'll follow your will."

Amy passed the choice to Shirone. From heaven's perspective, heretics were like foreign substances. If they wanted to accomplish anything, they had no choice but to put Shirone forward as their figurehead.

"It would be better to spend tonight here. I don't think Phoebe will report us. There's no reason for her to do so. Besides, we have Metagate, so we can escape if the worst happens."

Shirone trusted Phoebe. Though her personality was eccentric, she had reduced Kanya and Rena's lifespan reduction to one year.

A woman intelligent enough to be capable of self-criticism didn't seem like someone who would let emotions get the better of her and escalate things.

Rather, he was more worried about Kanya. Tomorrow, Kanya's mother would receive the wine of tales.

For a human who had spent their entire life indulging only in the existence called "me," becoming one with another human was terror.

"I understand why you were reluctant to talk about the wine of tales. But Kanya, do you really think that way? The wine of tales that I confirmed was..."

"I know, that it's unreasonable. I know that too."

Kanya readily admitted it.

For someone who had just moments ago described the wine of tales as a sacred technique, this was quite a radical statement.

But Shirone didn't find it strange. Faith and emotion were separate domains.

"I'm not stupid either. It would be a lie if I said I never had doubts. But what would change if I did? If you don't believe in God, you die. If you believe in God, you gain eternal life. There's no choice."

Kanya spoke the word "death" for the first time. She knew that death existed in heaven.

"If you're going to stay here, I'll prepare a place to rest. Come this way."

When she pressed a button on the distribution panel, the side of the building opened and a new structure flew over to connect with Kanya's house.

When Shirone's group looked surprised, she explained that most households owned multiple compartments.

"Hehe, the Mecca race likes to invite guests."

Kanya's smile pained Shirone's heart.

That night, Kanya and Rena lay on the same bed.

Their hearts raced as if they were running, making sleep impossible.

The sisters didn't cry. They were both waiting for the other to cry first.

As they tossed and turned endlessly, Rena turned around.

"Sister, tomorrow mom will be gone, right?"

Kanya looked pitifully at her younger sister who would lose her mother at such a young age.

As she gently stroked her hair, Rena said something unexpected.

"If it's Shirone oppa... I wouldn't mind yielding to you, sister."

Kanya's brow furrowed slightly. Her bewildered expression also concealed a heart that had been hit right on target.

"What are you talking about? Shirone is a Nephilim. How could I share my life with someone like that?"

"But sister will never date a heretic. And you'll never meet someone like Shirone oppa again. So now is your chance. You must seize it."

Kanya struggled to hold back her tears. Her younger sister's feelings came through clearly.

Tomorrow, mom wouldn't be home. Rena wanted to fill that emptiness with a new family member.

"Hehe, but you like Shirone too. If Shirone became your brother-in-law, you wouldn't be able to stand it with your personality. You'd be jealous of me every day."

"No! I'm serious! I can yield to you, sister!"

Kanya laughed. Anyway, both Kanya and Rena knew that nothing would come of it with Shirone.

It was just talk between girls in the deep of night.

As Rena snuggled in like a rain-soaked kitten, Kanya hugged her younger sister and kissed her forehead.

"Don't worry, Rena. I only have you."

Rena's eyes slowly closed.

Thus the last night was passing by.

Shirone's group rested in the room Kanya had provided.

Many things had happened during the day.

Not just Shirone, but his friends were also lost in their own thoughts, and for a while no conversation passed between them.

Tess pretended to cry as she spoke.

"Should we go back even now? Too many things happened in one day. Honestly, this place is too hard, really."

The others felt the same way. Just how many battles had they fought in 12 hours?

Moreover, each enemy they faced possessed power unlike anything they could see in their original world.

Not only were they tired, but the endless secrets of heaven that seemed to have no bottom no matter how deep they dug were also problematic. Having encountered so much information at once, their heads were spinning.

Canis said,

"We can't do that. How could we, having come this far? Arin and I must go to the Seventh Heaven Arabot."

If they had only planned to tour around Shamain, they wouldn't have attempted this in the first place.

Having come to heaven, there was no way to recover Metagate. Therefore, what they had paid as ticket fare was essentially an ancient artifact.

Amy hugged her pillow and turned over.

"But Arabot is where God lives, right? It must be the most difficult place to enter even in heaven. Just how do you plan to get there?"

"I'll handle it myself, so you don't need to worry. If you're afraid to go, just wait here instead."

"Oh? You're openly ignoring us? Should we just go back first then?"

"That's even more impossible. If we activate Metagate here, our memories will be reset. Memories are one-time use. Even if we stay, there would be no way for you to return."

Amy sat up, hitting the floor with her pillow.

"Huh? Was that really how it works? In the end, for us to return, we have to take you with us?"

"That's right. You didn't even know that until now, pumpkin?"

"What, pumpkin? Have you ever seen such a pretty pumpkin in the world?"

"I have. I think the one attached to your neck right now looks like that."

Amy gritted her teeth. She couldn't tell if it was a compliment or an insult, but it was true that Canis had shut her mouth.

Shirone sat down hugging his pillow.

"I don't plan to return yet either. But Canis, the timing for using Metagate must be rational. If anything other than survival remains in your head, you'll hesitate at the crucial moment."

"Hmph, I know that much. I can leave it to Arin. If it really becomes dangerous, heaven or whatever, we'll definitely return."

"By the way..."

Tess turned on her side, supporting her head. The curves of her body from head to toe were overwhelming.

'Adult... she's an adult.'

'Tess is an adult.'

The children's gazes focused on one spot, but Tess didn't mind, as if accustomed to it.

"How do they control lifespans in this place? Does something called God really exist and can manipulate people's lifespans at will?"

The children fell into thought.

"I think it's like magic. I had the same feeling when fighting Marsha noona, magic seems like nothing is impossible."

Certainly, Clay Marsha's abilities transcended imagination. But Amy, who had fought alongside them, viewed it negatively.

"Hmm, it's irregular. Reducing lifespans might be possible depending on the cost and conditions, but what about eternal life? No magic can extend lifespan. It's beyond human limitations."

"Is that so? I think there might be a way. Hmm."

Arin said,

"Why is everyone thinking so critically? Maybe Ra really is a god. Even if he didn't create the world, couldn't he at least be an existence approaching godhood?"

"That's also strange. If he's really a god, why would he need names to control lifespans?"

As Amy said, names were merely titles given by humans. It didn't make sense for an existence dependent on human language to be elevated to divine status.

Shirone said,

"Besides, don't you think the wine of tales is evil? For whatever reason, it treats human lives like objects. Ra might simply be controlling lifespans to manage heaven. The very concept of God managing the world doesn't make sense."

His friends realized that Shirone viewed heaven negatively. Good and evil were human concepts and fluid depending on environment. Making value judgments was something that should be approached with caution until the very end.

Tess said,

"But there's nothing we can do. It's the life they chose and their culture. Especially religion is a concept that holds absolute position within a cultural sphere."

"No, it's not religion. We just said it ourselves, Ra isn't a god."

"That's not important. Even if he's not a god but a dictator, it doesn't matter. Ra has the ability to govern lifespans anyway. What could be more important than that in religion?"

Shirone seemed to have more to say but ultimately swallowed his words.

Watching him, Amy realized that Shirone was still looking for a way to save Kanya's mother.

She liked such a Shirone, but now was the time to be cold-hearted.

"What are you going to do, Shirone? Tomorrow the wine of tales will proceed. As Tess said, it's what the divine subjects chose. It's not something we can intervene in just because it's unreasonable by our standards."

"But Miro denied the law."

"Shirone, that's..."

"I know. I'm not trying to follow her thinking. I'm saying my feelings are becoming similar. I think I can understand her to some extent now."

Shirone recalled the story about Miro he had heard at Norse Refuge. Even though Miro denied the law, the old man's mother said she didn't hate her.

If divine subjects were merely beings who submitted to Ra, how should those words be interpreted? What did Miro see and feel in heaven?

What was certain was that tomorrow, Shirone would also have no choice but to make a decision.

Perhaps Miro... might not have been wrong.

First Heaven Shamain.

Divine Subject Management Fairy Department, 73rd Branch.

The fairy department where Phoebe worked was located on the outskirts of Shamain, bordering Purgatory. Hundreds of houses were built on a giant tree called the World Tree, and small fairies flew between them like larks.

Phoebe went deep into the World Tree.

The fairy department head's residence was much smaller than a human house, but correspondingly more quaint and splendid.

When she opened the door and entered, Fairy Department Head Igirin was sitting in a chair with her wings folded. She wore heavy eye makeup, and golden vine patterns were carved on her cheeks.

Not only was she a fairy born from authority, but even considering age alone, she was an adult that Phoebe could never approach. Her beautiful appearance in particular drew admiration from other fairies.
