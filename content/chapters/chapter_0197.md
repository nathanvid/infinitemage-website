"Department Head, I've returned."

"Ah. Phoebe, the Spiral Fairy."

"Yes. You remember me."

"Of course I do. No fairy has been born since you came into existence a year ago."

Phoebe looked dejected. The youngest of the 72 fairy ranks. The only reason Igirin remembered her was something as trivial as that.

Fairies are female-form beings incapable of reproduction. To maintain their species, they can only wait for new individuals to be born, and Phoebe was the first fairy born in nearly ten years.

"What happened with the escapees? Kanya and Rena, wasn't it?"

"Yes. I obtained their confessions and they cooperated fully with the investigation."

"And the verdict?"

"I sentenced both of them to one year reduction."

"One year?"

When Igirin made a displeased expression, Phoebe swallowed nervously. She had no doubts about her verdict, but as a novice, she couldn't guarantee she had made the proper judgment.

"Though you're still young, you too are an enforcer of the law. I must respect your decision. But I have to askâ€”was there no external pressure?"

"No. It was my decision."

While Shirone had threatened her life, it hadn't amounted to external pressure. She had made the one-year verdict because she realized the excessive sentence was unreasonable.

Igirin looked at Phoebe with suspicious eyes.

Never before had an escape from Purgatory resulted in a mere one-year life reduction sentence. For a fairy only one year old, it was a surprisingly fresh judgment.

"Nothing else unusual happened? I heard that heretics followed the divine subjects inside."

Phoebe was conflicted. Strictly speaking, those who accompanied Kanya were not heretics but Nephilim.

However, if she revealed everything from start to finish, there was room for misinterpretation different from the facts. And that was not what Phoebe wanted.

"I never saw any heretics."

Igirin waited for the next words. The situation required additional explanation.

But no further comments came from Phoebe.

Sighing, Igirin waved her hand dismissively.

"Very well, you've done good work. You may go."

"Yes. Please rest well, Department Head."

Phoebe bowed her head and withdrew.

Once the door to his quarters closed, Igirin looked up at the empty space above and asked his aide, Mer, the Fairy of Truth.

"What do you think?"

"Phoebe spoke only the truth. However, it doesn't seem she told the whole story."

"I suspected as much. What on earth happened? She's still at an age where she needs to learn much, but I'm concerned she's developing such strong opinions from such a young age."

Igirin rested his chin on his hand, lost in thought.

"Find out about the humans who entered heaven following the divine subjects. There should be detailed records at the Mecca Command."

"I'll depart immediately."

With that response, Mer exited through a hole in the ceiling.

Igirin crossed his legs and rubbed his brow.

District 73 was famous for being a quiet, incident-free area. Yet humans who were neither heretics nor divine subjects had entered such a place.

Her intuition, honed over three thousand years of life, brought one particular heretic to mind.

"Adrias Miro..."

"Whew, I thought I'd die from nervousness."

Phoebe dragged her exhausted body toward home.

Having lived for a year, she should have adapted by now, but her body inevitably stiffened every time she met Igirin.

Especially on days like today when she had to make autonomous decisions, the pressure was even more intense.

"Sigh, being an enforcer of law is tough too."

"Hee hee hee! What's so hard about dealing with divine subjects? It's all because you're incompetent."

At the sound from behind, Phoebe frowned. Turning around, she saw the three fairy sisters approaching with mocking smiles, as expected.

Before Phoebe was born, these three had been the youngest. Though fairies born from concepts have no blood relations, these fairies were called sisters because they were born around the same time.

"Hello, seniors."

Phoebe forced a smile. The three fairy sisters' expressions grew even more fierce.

Their faces hadn't always looked like that from the beginning.

Fairies born from emotions easily show changes of heart on their faces.

Any fairy who goes through about ten years as the youngest inevitably changes to look like that.

"We heard the story. You gave a one-year sentence? You got swayed by humans, didn't you? We can tell without even looking."

"No, that's not it. I genuinely thought that way."

"Oh, really? Then that was a truly foolish verdict. Now you've officially become a pushover. You'd better not think the divine subjects will respect you from now on!"

The three fairy sisters covered their mouths and laughed shrilly.

Phoebe was angry but couldn't show it. If you get on the bad side of direct seniors, you'll suffer for life. And that lifetime meant at least ten thousand years.

She had no choice but to endure and persevere. Once the next youngest was born, they would leave her alone too.

"Anyway, do your job properly. In the old days, kids like you wouldn't have been made enforcers at all. These days they're lenient because emotions aren't born often. Squeeze the divine subjects harder."

"I am doing that."

"What do you mean you're doing it? What does a one-year-old like you know to talk back?"

Phoebe shut her mouth.

It was laughable that they were giving advice when they'd barely passed ten years themselves, but in fairy society's strict hierarchy, a one-year-old had no way to raise her voice.

"Got it? You have to make them fear us. That's how divine subjects obey. Be careful not to let this kind of thing happen again."

After the three fairy sisters made their threats and left, Phoebe felt like she had aged ten years.

Perhaps that's why she felt like she could take them on right now.

Of course, that was only possible in her imagination.

"Sigh, I'm tired. I want to go home quickly."

Phoebe's flight wobbled as she let her limbs hang loose.

The next morning.

The central plaza of Shamain District 73, awaiting the wine of tales, was bustling from early morning.

The Mecca race checked their devices while the Norse race verified the magic integrated into their techniques.

When the Kergo people began leading the subjects through rehearsals, Shirone clutched his aching chest.

Rehearsals for an event where people die. Just how insignificant did heaven's god consider human life?

When preparations were complete, the subjects said farewell to their families, including Kanya and Rena.

"Mother! Mother!"

Rena's tears wouldn't stop. Even brave Kanya was now just a pitiful daughter sending her mother away.

As the time for the ritual approached, Kanya pulled Epiness and Korfin from her bosom.

"Drink this. It will help."

Shirone knew what Kanya was offering.

After learning what the wine of tales truly was, thinking about it made his heart feel even more lukewarm.

What help could stimulants and sedatives possibly provide?

Actually, he didn't know. With their brains melting as they became giants, there was no way to know how their minds would be transformed.

Perhaps it was better than nothing.

For parents, nothing gives more courage than medicine their child brought them.

When preparations to begin the ritual were complete, the divine subjects spread out in a circle around the statue.

It was no different from the scene he'd witnessed in Phoebe's memory, except that there were ten subjects this time.

According to Kanya, the executor of the wine of tales was the oldest person in the district. Being old meant they'd continuously received life extensions, making them the most faithful among the divine subjects.

This time too, the executor was a Kergo person.

He appeared to be a robust young man, but was said to be one hundred eighty-seven years old.

He belonged to the noble class among the Kergo race and was reportedly scheduled to gain eternal life soon and move to the Third Heaven Shehaqim.

"The wine of tales will now be administered! Subjects, come forward!"

The ten subjects approached the glass orb.

It would be a lie to say they weren't afraid. Melting in strange drugs and merging into one was the most disgusting and terrifying death for humans.

"Mother! Mother!"

Just as Kanya was about to run forward, her father held her back.

Despite clearly hearing her daughter's voice, the mother didn't look back.

Everyone was behaving similarly.

The subjects smiled for their families, and families hid their sorrow for the subjects.

Shirone didn't think it was beautiful.

He didn't know what value the wine of tales held for the divine subjects, but approving such sorcery was wrong from the start.

The subjects undressed and entered the glass orb. Then they sat on the cold glass floor, closed their eyes, and offered prayers.

Shirone's anger surged.

What exactly were they praying for? What praise could they offer to the god who drove them to death?

"This is murder. I can't allow it."

Shirone finally voiced what he'd been holding back. It was a conclusion reached after countless deliberations since last night.

The wine of tales had to be stopped.

Anyone who understood it was murder would do the same.

Shirone walked toward the statue. He intended to halt the ritual before the subjects died.

Tess grabbed Shirone's wrist.

"Shirone, wait. I'm angry too. But this isn't the world we live in. There's even a saying about following that country's laws when in that country."

"I don't know who said that, but it's just human thinking. Kanya's mother committed no crime. Being killed in this manner should never happen under any circumstances."

"But what can we do? Even if we stop the wine of tales, Kanya's mother's lifespan ends today. If we go to the trouble of saving her, we'll just put ourselves in danger."

"No, that's not true. Perhaps Kanya's mother won't die today after all."

"What? What do you mean?"

The reason the wine of tales is performed despite divine subjects' doubts is because Ra controls lifespans. The fact that they would die today anyway makes them follow the law.

But Shirone said the law was wrong. If there really was an error in the wine of tales, then the divine subjects were being deceived. It was outright fraud. In that case, there was plenty of room to change the situation.

"Inject the fuel of life! We begin the wine of tales."

When the executor shouted, the Kergo people became busy. Once the water started rising, there would be no second chance. Though he didn't know when bodily decomposition would begin, drowning would come first.

Just as the Kergo person approached the device, Shirone shouted.

"Wait! I cannot allow the wine of tales!"

The divine subjects' gazes focused on Shirone.

It was easy to spot him standing alone in the clearing. However, not knowing the language, they couldn't understand his meaning.

Shirone looked back at Arin. He meant for her to interpret. With no choice, Arin sighed and approached.

She knew better than anyone that Shirone had a careful personality. Having made a decision meant he wouldn't bend under any circumstances.

Arin expanded her Spirit Zone. Mental-type mages specialized in tentacle forms, but when addressing crowds, simply expanding the zone like this was sufficient.

Shirone repeated his earlier words.

The language penetrated the divine subjects' minds. Since it was the same ability as fairies possessed, no one was surprised. However, the meaning contained in the words couldn't simply be overlooked.

Hostility filled the divine subjects' eyes. Considering an event worshipping Ra as evil was clearly heretical logic.

The executor couldn't hide his anger as he snapped back.

"By what right do you say you cannot allow the ritual? Are you not a divine subject? Do you wish to face death without even a chance of resurrection?"

"I am Nephilim."

The venue instantly fell silent.

Even in the original world, Immortal Function wasn't a realm just anyone could reach.

This was the first time in at least their lifetimes that Nephilim had revealed themselves in District 73.

The executor was equally flustered.

He had faithfully carried out Ra's missions to reach this position. His age of 187 was like a medal of honor to him.

But even such a medal couldn't compare to presenting a business card before Nephilim.

Nephilim were descendants of angels.

Though they couldn't interfere with the law, they were beings fundamentally different from divine subjects by birth.

"Nephilim... why do you feel aversion to the wine of tales? This is law established by god."
