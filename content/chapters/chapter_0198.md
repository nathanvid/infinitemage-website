"Laws? Do your laws happen to include murder as well?"

"Of course. Divine subjects can never harm other divine subjects. If someone commits murder, they receive severe punishment according to the judgment of the Interior Ministry."

"Then what are you doing right now? If your laws prohibit murder, why are you proceeding with the wine of tales?"

"I don't understand what you're saying. Are you truly Nephilim? You sound like a heretic."

"Nephilim or whatever, I don't care. I am one who doesn't know my own lifespan. That's precisely why I can live each day doing my best. But look at them. They're alive, yet they're not truly living. How is this different from the murder you speak of?"

No voices of condemnation or agreement came from the divine subjects. However, the atmosphere was growing increasingly heated.

This was a contradiction that any divine subject had felt at least once.

The wine of tales certainly seemed unreasonable. But the reason no one refused it was because of inertia built up over hundreds of thousands of years.

Countless people had become giants through the wine of tales until now. The fact that everyone had done it and would continue to do so blocked the divine subjects' judgment.

"You who deny Ra's law, we were born from giants. The wine of tales is God's arrangement that allows our lives to be revived again. Do you wish for your existence to be eternally annihilated? If there are any among the divine subjects who desire this, come forward. I will personally petition for it to be granted."

No one stepped forward. According to facts passed down by the divine subjects from long ago, giants created through the wine of tales travel through Purgatory and return to be decomposed back into individual entities.

It's better to live forever than to die. If one must inevitably die, they want to at least leave a chance to return.

That is life.

Ra dominated life in such a way.

Satisfied with the divine subjects' silence, the executor pointed accusingly at Shirone and shouted.

"You are a heretic! No, even if you claim to be Nephilim, you have no right to interfere with the law! Everyone arrest this person! Make them pay for blaspheming Ra's sanctity!"

"Shirone, things have gotten complicated! You need to escape now."

Amy grabbed Shirone's hand. But Shirone shook off her hand and held his ground.

"No, I won't go. I have to save Kanya's mother—her."

From the front, about ten Kergo people came running with drawn swords. Their speed using giant techniques was as fast as cheetahs.

Shirone dove into their center. The lead Kergo raised his sword. The follow-up team also surrounded Shirone, swinging their blades.

At that moment, Shirone's fury exploded.

A barrier of light struck the Kergo people. The mass contained in the photons was minute, so at first it only felt numbing, but when struck twenty times per second, a counter-elasticity that felt like their bodies would tear apart was transmitted.

All the Kergo people surrounding Shirone were sent flying.

Dragging their buttocks as they slid long distances across the ground, they all looked at Shirone with eyes of shock.

"Ne, Nephilim? Were you really Nephilim?"

Light magic had a great psychological effect. It was a phenomenon only angels could manifest, and it was magic that imprinted the fact that Shirone was Nephilim.

Following up on his momentum, Shirone concentrated his Photon Cannon.

The moment the executor sensed danger and blocked the bronze statue, a flash burst from Shirone.

The executor twisted his body with animal-like reflexes. As the flash grazed his side, he felt pain as if his internal organs were being crushed.

But pain was a later concern.

When the Photon Cannon struck the giant statue, a magnificent resonance spread like the sound of a struck bell.

The divine subjects backed away, covering their ears from the sound waves vibrating throughout the venue.

They were shouting something noisily, but the ringing in their ears sounded louder than their voices.

Nevertheless, the giant statue remained intact.

The power of Photon Cannon was enough to dent even iron doors, but there wasn't even a wrinkled trace on the statue.

Joy filled the divine subjects' eyes.

"Oh! Anke Ra! Please save us!"

"Do not abandon us! Eternal life, eternal life!"

As the situation became serious, Amy stepped forward. She had to somehow bring Shirone and escape this place.

At that moment, Ryan grabbed her shoulder and turned her around.

"Wait. Shirone isn't finished yet."

"That's not the problem. If we don't run away quickly, we'll have to fight them."

"Then we can fight, can't we?"

Only then did Amy turn her head. Regardless of the friendship they had shared until now, the current Ryan was solely Shirone's knight.

"What's wrong with you, Ryan? Do you have something you want to say?"

"I do. You guys are being strange right now. What are you going to accomplish by stopping Shirone?"

"Of course we should run away. If we become enemies in heaven, there's no one who will help us."

"Then what about Kanya's mother?"

Amy's heart sank with a thud. She realized she couldn't realistically feel someone's death.

"Shirone is trying to save Kanya's mother. Just like he did for Marsha, who was our enemy, just like he did for the magic school students. But why aren't you trying to help? Don't tell me you think we're not responsible for the deaths of people in this place because it's not the world we used to live in?"

"Ah..."

Ryan's analysis was accurate. Because different rules and laws applied here, she had thought there was no reason to take responsibility for deaths they had chosen.

"Amy, whether this is heaven or wherever, this is happening before our very eyes. Shirone said he can save Kanya's mother. That's why I will fight alongside Shirone."

Amy looked around the plaza. Around Shirone, Mecca people armed with Signa and Exd, and Norse people wielding ancient magic were surrounding him.

The human spirit is not something trivial. Even if this was heaven, the truth of life couldn't be different.

The look of conflict disappeared from Amy's face.

"I trust Shirone too. Let's go, Ryan."

As Amy launched her body, her friends immediately followed.

Where the divine subjects were surrounding Shirone, light flashed and over ten people scattered outward. When Shirone revealed himself after casting fury, Amy leaned against his back and asked.

"Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?"

"Yeah. Signa and Exd seem weak at long range, and ancient magic appears to be mostly wind-based. And weak too. It seems their skill is lower than Clove's."

From heaven's perspective, Purgatory was hell.

No matter how poor Clove's skills were, he was a mage who traversed the harsh Purgatory, so he could be said to be of a higher level than those here.

Shirone's group defended against the divine subjects' attacks from their respective positions.

The problem was that counterattacking wasn't feasible. In a situation where they needed to persuade the divine subjects, if casualties occurred, it could actually worsen the situation.

"Tch! How annoying."

Canis pressed his hand to the ground and cast Shadow Wall.

Sharp thorns protruded from the surface of shadows that rose like castle walls.

The Mecca race blocked with their Exd at the front, but they didn't have any particular way to attack either.

—Shirone, we can't hold out indefinitely. You need to make a decision now.

Shirone's thoughts became complicated. In fact, there was one way to end the battle without fighting.

It was the illumination magic Shining.

If he shot an intense light momentarily to block the enemies' vision, the battle's atmosphere would rapidly cool down.

'But would Shining alone be possible?'

The biggest problem was that it was broad daylight. No matter how much he increased the light's intensity, he couldn't surpass sunlight.

The reason it was difficult to create light stronger than the sun was due to light's oscillating properties.

He needed to maximize the number of photons in a single area, but oscillating light had limits to compression.

'How can I increase the light's intensity?'

At that moment, Shirone's eyes flashed.

He couldn't stop light's oscillation. But creating light stronger than the sun might be possible.

—Close your eyes! I'm going to cast Shining!

Shirone stopped moving and entered his Spirit Zone. Light particles began gathering rapidly.

His friends closed their eyes, but Canis, who was maintaining a defensive barrier, looked back at Shirone.

'What's that? Why is the light like that?'

The light gathering around Shirone was much dimmer than conventional Shining. Weak light meant reduced luminosity. Ultimately, it meant he was somehow suppressing oscillation.

'He unified the polarization direction.'

Some particles oscillate vertically and some horizontally. Shirone had applied gravity to photons to unify the light's oscillation direction.

The result was marvelous. An impossible number of photons were gathering at one point naturally. Because they were more stabilized than ordinary photons, the light's color was also close to gray. When Shining began emitting white light, it boasted dozens of times the normal density.

—I'm casting it now!

Shirone squeezed his eyes shut and released control of the photons. Light particles scattered in all directions like an unbridled colt.

The brightness of the white light that devoured the world reached a whopping 300,000 lumens. It was more than twice as intense as staring directly at the midday sun.

Shirone realized his magic had succeeded without seeing it.

The light was so intense that even with his eyes closed, he could faintly distinguish shadows.

'It worked! It really worked!'

Divine particles were the core principle of the magic Shirone wielded.

Mass-based Photon Cannon, energy-based laser. And now, Shining Impact that compressed photons to cause a flash explosion.

Because it transcended natural light's intensity, it was non-lethal magic that could incapacitate living beings regardless of time and place.

Even after the light disappeared, the divine subjects kept their eyes closed. They were leaning back their upper bodies in case of attack and covering their faces with both arms.

Silence flowed.

Shirone's group opened their eyes first, followed by the divine subjects lifting their eyelids and looking around left and right.

"Ne, Nephilim. You are Nephilim."

When someone muttered, the Mecca race began dropping their weapons one by one.

Shining Impact was more effective than just stopping the battle.

Even contracting with light spirits, creating light stronger than the sun was impossible.

If there existed a being capable of it, that would undoubtedly be an angel who wielded the power of light.

Tess wiped the sweat flowing down his chin.

"Whew. Shirone, what kind of magic was that? I was startled, thinking I'd go blind."

Though said like a joke, he was serious. He had never been exposed to such intense light in his life.

Ryan approached, sheathing his great sword.

"Anyway, since we've incapacitated the enemies, that's good. Now we just need to stop the wine of tales?"

"It won't be easy. Unlike the other divine subjects, the Kergo people aren't wavering."

As Amy said, the executor and other ritual officials were glaring at Shirone with fierce eyes.

Of course, they too were somewhat intimidated by Shining Impact's power.

But if they thought of it as Nephilim's power, there was no reason to suffer mental damage.

To them who solely followed Ra, lower laws were not frightening.

"Do you think you'll be safe after doing this, Nephilim? You have disrupted sacred Ra's law. When the Interior Ministry moves, your lifespan will end today."

"Go ahead if you can. You can't control my lifespan that even I don't know."

The executor's nose bridge twisted.

He wanted to behead him immediately, but honestly, he didn't feel like fighting.

These were 187 years obtained by dedicating his entire life. Now that eternal life was before his eyes, he couldn't end his life here.

Red energy appeared in Shirone's palm.

Now that the divine subjects were frightened was the last opportunity. Rather than clumsily stirring up anger with Photon Cannon, the strategy was to definitely destroy it with laser.

As a red beam extended toward the statue, the divine subjects recoiled in horror.

But no one else charged forward anymore. If Shirone was Nephilim, he wasn't someone divine subjects could handle.
