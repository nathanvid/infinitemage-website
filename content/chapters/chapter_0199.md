The spot hit by the laser began to heat up, and the statue started shaking as if it would burst at any moment.

"This can't be. How is this happening...!"

The executor gritted his teeth. He could neither attack Shirone nor prevent the statue's destruction.

At that moment, the sound of thunder echoed from the sky.

Blue lightning fell in clusters, heating the air around Shirone intensely.

The ground exploded, raising clouds of dust.

The executor checked where the lightning had come from. A group of fairies was flying toward them from the entrance of the plaza.

Even from a distance, Shirone immediately spotted the fairy positioned at the center of the group.

She alone was glowing with golden light, and her made-up face was beautiful as well.

It was Igirin, the department head of Divine Subject Management.

Shirone's friends took positions around him. A tension he hadn't felt when fighting the divine subjects made his blood flow faster.

What was puzzling was that the preemptive attack had been electrical.

Since electricity was an attribute close to spirits, it wasn't something fairies could wield.

*Who cast the lightning?*

*We can't tell yet. But there must be a fairy among them who handles friction.*

If they could create friction among atmospheric charges, generating lightning was possible. Since electricity flows according to charge placement, the poor accuracy was natural.

Rian drew his great sword and stepped forward.

"A full fairy unit deployment? What we expected has finally come."

Shirone had also anticipated this. Since they had broken heaven's laws, it was normal for internal affairs officers to be dispatched.

The divine subjects stepped aside left and right, opening a path for Igirin.

The fairies flew forward with dignified bearing and faced off against Shirone's group at a distance of ten meters.

Shirone looked at Phoebe, who stood at the edge of the fairy group.

Unlike the other fairies, she was staring ahead with vacant eyes. Her expression suggested she didn't understand why she had to be here.

Igirin pointed at Shirone's group.

"So it's you, the ones who entered heaven by impersonating Nephilim. That alone is a grave sin, yet now you dare to interfere with the sacred wine of tales?"

The executor's expression turned puzzled. Did she mean they impersonated Nephilim rather than being actual Nephilim?

But the ability the boy had cast moments ago was definitely that of an angel. If they weren't Nephilim, how could they manipulate light?

"Lord Igirin, are you saying these are heretics? That one definitely used the power of light."

"Don't be deceived. The earthly kingdom has techniques for handling light magic. Besides, the others are heretics who don't even need verification. They tried to deceive even fairies in such a manner."

Canis's eyes sharpened.

Listening to her words, they had investigated them in detail. Moreover, the fact that Phoebe, whose combat ability was lacking, had come along was proof that she had spilled everything.

"Damn it! That's why I said we should leave. That fairy betrayed us. I never trusted her from the beginning."

Phoebe frowned.

Betrayal? She had simply followed Igirin's orders frantically. She hadn't even known they were there until arrival.

"Hmph! Yes! I told them everything! You're all dead now! You should have caused trouble in moderation!"

She had no intention of claiming innocence to humans anyway. Phoebe actually took on crimes she hadn't committed and provoked them further.

"You didn't betray us."

Shirone said.

"Phoebe made the right judgment. There's no reason for such a fairy to now undermine her own beliefs."

Phoebe turned her head away with a huff. It meant she was hurt that he would say such things now.

But many thoughts arose in her mind.

Right judgment. Beliefs.

These were values that her seniors had never acknowledged even once.

Igirin didn't care. Living for over three thousand years allows one to divide concepts more finely than humans.

If humans could list about a hundred types of love, she could probably distinguish about ten thousand.

Upon reaching such a level, all events become independent.

Peeping into someone's house doesn't make one a thief.

Breaking that house's lock doesn't make one a thief.

Breaking the lock and entering might still not make one a thief. Even picking up some object there might not make one a thief.

Only when one comes outside carrying the picked-up object does the concept of "thief" become perfectly established.

This was a cognitive ability impossible for humans, who try to prejudge the whole from partial events.

In that sense, the conversation between Shirone and Phoebe was merely an independent event from the current situation.

"I am Igirin, department head of Divine Subject Management, fairy of authority. For the crime of entering heaven by impersonating Nephilim while being heretics, and for interfering with the noble wine of tales, I hereby reduce all your lifespans."

Wrinkles formed on Shirone's forehead.

"Is it always like this? Killing people's lives just because you don't like them? The wine of tales is the same. Why do you drive divine subjects to death?"

"You were born from giants. What's so unfair about returning to nothingness?"

"That's nonsense. No parent asks their child to return their flesh."

"Planting seeds in the ground is for harvesting food. Living things die to provide food for other living things. You too are merely beings bound by this law."

"Planting seeds is to bear new seeds. Living things die to give opportunities to other living things. That's how humans prosper. Life without meaning in living is no different from being dead."

Igirin let out a sorrowful sigh. Why were such intuitions never wrong? It wasn't coincidence that Miro's face flashed past when looking at Shirone.

"Truly heretical. You're humans we must not associate with. What are you doing! Begin the wine of tales immediately!"

As if waiting for Igirin's command, the executor moved.

When he pulled the switch, black liquid began filling the ten glass orbs.

"Damn it! There's no time! We have to stop it now!"

Rian and Tess ran toward the statue to destroy it.

Igirin raised her hand to command the fairies.

"Attack! Never let them approach!"

Shirone's group entered combat stance.

Arin disconnected mental resonance, leaving only the channel connected to the party. Since Igirin's mental resonance was spreading throughout, there was no need for translation.

The fairy of projectiles began the preemptive attack. When she extended her hand, air shot out as if holes were punched in the atmosphere.

Small, solid masses of gas pelted Shirone's group.

While not enough to penetrate bodies, they were invisible and so numerous that resistance was impossible.

"Fall back!"

Canis erected a Shadow Wall. The air bullets drummed against the Shadow Wall's surface with sounds like falling hail.

At that moment, a sharp noise arose from the sky.

When the fairy of friction generated static electricity to strike lightning, Harvest deflected it.

Flashing lightning struck repeatedly, but it didn't work on magical creatures.

"Hehehe! This feels good? Is this some new massage technique?"

Amy, with her back against the Shadow Wall barrier, floated Jack O'Lantern above her palm.

The fire sphere that flew skyward multiplied into dozens and indiscriminately bombarded the front.

Since it was Jack O'Lantern's unique ability of fake flames, only three were actual fire. But not knowing which were real, those on the receiving end couldn't help but feel terror.

When Amy's bombardment scattered the fairies, Canis finally withdrew the Shadow Wall.

With a clear view, Arin quickly identified the fairies' positions and proposed a strategy through the mental channel.

*If fairies are mental beings, I have a way. I should be able to catch them with Mental Shock.*

Shirone thought it made sense.

In magic versus magic combat, there were compatibility issues, but fairies would have no recourse against direct mental attacks.

*Can you manage it? There are many of them.*

*I'll cast wide-area Mental Shock. It consumes considerable mental power, but once is possible. But lure the fairies to me. Twenty-meter radius centered on me.*

Herding all the fairies would be difficult, but if even half succeeded, they could seize the battle's momentum.

"Good! Let's scatter too!"

Individual combat began.

The fairies' abilities were formidable. As if expecting battle, most were concepts specialized for combat.

But if enemies were strong, it was actually better for those doing the luring.

"Huh? Huh?"

In the battlefield where all kinds of magic flew about, only Phoebe was flying around unable to get her bearings.

It was her first real combat, and the power of the magic being exchanged was on a completely different dimension from her own.

Flash approached Phoebe with a flicker.

Startled, Phoebe raised both hands and prepared to use her spiral ability.

Shirone also reflexively equipped Photon Cannon.

When they belatedly confirmed each other's faces, both their pupils wavered.

Phoebe bit her lips, unable to make a judgment. Then Shirone also canceled Photon Cannon and turned away.

Phoebe looked at him with puzzled eyes, but he said nothing and just ran toward another fairy.

Phoebe's head drooped glumly.

*Arin! I can't do this anymore! This is the limit!*

Since fairies had flight ability, herding them into one place was nearly impossible.

But since Shirone's party's mages were also top-level in movement, they could lure more than half into the area.

*That's enough!*

Movement is the combination of time and space.

The moment less than a second when fairies entered the area was the only timing Arin could cast magic.

Arin crouched down and pressed both hands to the ground. As her shadow expanded like a sinkhole, five fairies sensed danger and flew up.

But it was already too late.

With a bang, mental waves surged up and soil scattered all at once.

The fairies wobbled unable to get their bearings, then stopped their wings like they'd drunk insecticide and crashed down one after another.

When half their forces were eliminated, the demoralized fairies began screaming and fleeing.

While Harvest chased them away with claw swipes, Rian and Tess also succeeded in breaking through the Kergo people's encirclement and returning the switch to its original position.

The liquid that had risen about a third was sucked back into the tank, lowering the water level in the glass orbs.

The subjects breathed sighs of relief.

But even that would be torture. A glimmer of hope was merely another word for almost absolute despair.

"Shirone! Now's the time! Smash it with laser!"

Shirone had already finished preparations.

If the statue was destroyed, the wine of tales would stop. With the fairies routed, no one could interfere with him now.

The moment Shirone's laser emitted red light, Igirin's voice permeated the battlefield.

"I command as God's subordinate: you who lack authority in this world, kneel before me."

When the incantation ended, something amazing happened.

As if the world went out, all humans knelt down. Shirone's group was no exception.

With his knees pressed to the ground, Shirone was bewildered. He tried to put strength in his legs to stand up, but his body was as heavy as if he'd become an elephant.

Words poured out through the mental channel.

*What happened? I can't stand up.*

*She definitely said she was the fairy of authority. What does this have to do with authority?*

*This isn't simple magic. This is unregulated.*

Shirone also thought that if it wasn't unregulated magic, the current result couldn't occur.

Then how was it activated?

It wasn't an incantation. Making hundreds of people kneel just by throwing words was impossible.

Unlike Shirone's group, the divine subjects didn't even resist. They were simply looking up at Igirin with reverent eyes.

Igirin leisurely passed among the divine subjects and approached the statue. Then she personally pulled the switch.

As liquid began filling the glass orbs again, the subjects' eyes squeezed shut.

The sobbing of families could be heard from somewhere.
