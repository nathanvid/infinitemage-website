Shirone gritted his teeth. There was nothing else he could do.

He felt like he could cast magic, but if he tried to teleport in his current state, his body would be torn apart.

'Damn it! I have to move somehow.'

If time continued to pass like this, Kanya's mother would die.

No, everyone would die. In the end, the only one left would be that hideous giant whose name he didn't even know.

"Give up, foolish humans. No one can interfere with Ra's laws."

Igirin gazed with satisfaction at the sight of all the humans kneeling.

This was authority. Submission wasn't something to be forced—it happened voluntarily.

"Damn, why is this so heavy?"

At the sound coming from behind the statue, Igirin's face hardened.

Then came the sound of footsteps—thud, thud. Everyone turned to look in that direction as if a ghost were about to appear.

Tess brightened up and shouted.

"Rian!"

Rian walked forward with a grimace on his face.

His body weight seemed to be about one ton.

The reason he wasn't crushed to death was that the weight was being distributed across his entire body.

"What did you do to me? My body is incredibly heavy."

"How can you move...?"

This wasn't magic that could be endured through brute strength alone. Since the weight was proportional to muscle mass, the stronger one's muscles, the heavier the body would become.

If he was moving, there was only one possibility: he was exerting force beyond what his muscles could normally produce.

Of course, that could hardly be considered normal for a human either.

'Exerting force beyond his physical limits? No, that can't be. That's one of the highest-level abilities among giant techniques.'

While Igirin was lost in thought, a dull sound came from where Shirone's group was.

"Hehehe, quite an amusing magic. This is why battles are fun."

Harvest suddenly emerged from Canis's shadow.

Seeing both Rian's and Harvest's cases, Shirone realized something.

A relative weight was being applied, not an absolute one. Since different activation principles required different countermeasures, this was crucial information.

"Shall we have a go at this?"

Harvest charged at Igirin. However, the Fairy Department Head's flight ability wasn't to be underestimated either.

While momentarily entranced by the hawk-like chase scene, Shirone shouted to Rian.

"Rian! There's no time! You have to destroy the statue!"

When Rian raised his great sword in front of the statue, the flying Igirin's face filled with shock.

He could dismiss the shadow chasing him as not being human, but the swordsman was made of flesh and blood.

To swing a great sword while under the Regulatory Exception would require nearly 100 percent physical dominance.

When Rian roared and struck the statue, a loud bang erupted.

The divine subjects were startled, but the statue didn't even crack.

Rian gritted his teeth.

He wanted to smash everything in sight, but in the current situation, all he could do was deliver one more strike.

"Damn it! If not for this strange magic!"

The liquid in the orb had risen to half full. The subjects seemed to have given up and were closing their eyes.

From their perspective, they would probably hate Rian instead. If there had been no interference, everything would be peaceful by now.

Arin spoke through the mental channel.

—We need to find a way. Restraining the movements of hundreds of people with just an incantation doesn't match equivalent exchange. There must be conditions we don't know about.

Shirone had the same thought.

No matter how extraordinary the abilities of a Regulatory Exception might be, it all occurred within the zero-sum framework of equivalent exchange.

Given the strength of the ability, there had to be a way to break free while restrained.

Shirone recalled Marsha's advice.

Regulatory Exceptions were deeply connected to the caster's nature.

Igirin was a fairy of authority. Therefore, it was highly likely that his ability was somehow related to the concept of authority.

"Hiyaaah!"

Rian didn't give up and continued striking the statue.

Each time the thunderous sound echoed, the divine subjects' faces turned pale one by one.

At some point, Amy's red eyes blazed crimson. Her self-image memory had immediately detected the physical change.

—Shirone, the restraining force isn't fixed. The weight just decreased by 5 kilograms. This time it's 7 kilograms, 9 kilograms... The weight is decreasing each time Rian swings his sword.

Shirone's eyes flashed with realization. Through Amy's words, he understood the mechanism of Igirin's Regulatory Exception.

"Rian! Keep striking! The wine of tales isn't some regeneration technique! It's just murder!"

—Shirone! It just weakened by 60 kilograms! Could this be...!

—Yes! I'm not certain, but it seems like Igirin quantifies authority to generate physical force. The more people doubt, the weaker the weight will become.

As if proving Shirone's theory, Igirin's expression twisted.

The doubt count suddenly spiked at the shout that the wine of tales was murder.

It wasn't a cry born of desperation. It meant the heretics had ultimately figured out the magic's activation conditions.

Regulatory Exception: Authority.

Igirin could apply scales measuring belief and doubt to targets within his domain.

The moment he spoke the incantation, all living beings in the area would be divided into believers and doubters.

Currently, there were 318 subjects gathered in the central plaza, with a ratio of 293 believers to 25 doubters.

If everyone believed in Igirin, the weight applied per unit area would be 100 percent of their strength, making movement theoretically impossible.

Conversely, if the belief ratio dropped below half, the "Price of False Claims" would activate, and Igirin would have to pay the price of bearing 100 percent weight for 24 hours.

Shirone realized why Rian's actions affected the magic. The fear of heaven's symbol being damaged was planting seeds of doubt in the divine subjects' hearts.

Indeed, each time Rian struck the giant statue, the weight weakened ever so slightly.

"Everyone, snap out of it! The wine of tales is a lie! It's a technique to kill you!"

He continued pressuring the divine subjects, but the weight no longer decreased.

Trials strengthen faith.

While some might be terrified, others were undoubtedly burning their will even stronger.

"Shut up! You're the ones deceiving us!"

"Kill them! Kill the heretics!"

The core believers' anger reached its peak at the act of damaging the statue.

As more turned into fanatics, even some doubters began to change their minds.

Shirone didn't give up despite knowing this. It was the only resistance he could offer while unable to move.

"You say the wine of tales is a regeneration technique? You're next! Why don't you understand that?"

"We will follow the laws. We will live out the lifespan granted by Ra and return to our original bodies!"

Shirone gritted his teeth. Regulatory Exception or not, his frustration with the divine subjects' closed-mindedness reached its peak.

"You can live longer! The wine of tales subjects don't have to die today!"

As if by magic, the divine subjects' clamor disappeared. Everyone stared at Shirone with shocked expressions.

Taking the sudden silence as a signal, Harvest abandoned his pursuit of Igirin.

The battle wouldn't be decided this way anyway.

Rather than acting scattered, it would be better to shake the divine subjects through psychological warfare with her.

Igirin frowned. The ratio showed how effective this latest statement had been.

267 to 51.

Seventeen percent of all subjects had begun to doubt. The weight decrease was noticeable enough to feel on his skin. The rapid change in sensation would also work unfavorably for maintaining authority.

"We can live? We... can live longer?"

"Yes. If the subjects were really dying at the end of their natural lifespan right now, we could at least call it a funeral. But they're not dying. The wine of tales cannot become your grave!"

—Shirone, what are you saying?

Amy couldn't believe it. Wasn't it because the lifespan registry was absolute that the divine subjects followed it? If this was improvisation to get out of the situation, the aftermath would be difficult to handle.

Shirone hadn't brought this up with complete certainty either. However, after thinking all night, his conclusion was that the possibility wasn't entirely absent.

"I met heretics in Purgatory. Among them were people not born in heaven. So they don't know their own lifespans. But they're not dominated by anyone's control over their lifespan either."

"Of course, since they're heretics..."

"Wake up! Still don't get it? They can't do it because they don't know the names. It's not that they won't—they can't! If god is omnipotent, why would names be necessary?"

Igirin's face turned serious.

229 to 89.

If the ratio of doubters exceeded half, authority would disappear. Only 70 counts remained until reaching that point.

The executor shouted.

"Silence! That too is merely a principle of law! The fact that we gain eternal life or are regenerated according to Ra's will doesn't change! Don't mock the divine subjects with heretical logic!"

"It's not law! It's magic! Whatever Ra's ability is, if it's related to magic, they can live longer!"

The word "magic" was effective. If the sacred phenomenon occurring through law was merely magic, then god's status would inevitably fall to human standards.

"How can they live longer? Is there any proof?"

Someone from among the divine subjects shouted.

Igirin glared at him sharply. The doubter count had just increased by one.

"I've studied the properties of time. To conclude, time is relative. It applies differently to everyone here."

Among the divine subjects, there were those who studied time. Norse magicians and Mecca's opticians.

Their number was probably around six. 222 to 96. Those who understood Shirone's words began to doubt.

"Even if that's true, so what?"

"If the ability to grant lifespans is related to time, then the lifespans of wine of tales subjects aren't accurate. Even if a lifespan is fixed at 40 years, they can't die at exactly those 40 years. Because the time they experience is fluid."

"But it's just a hypothesis. If it's law and not magic, we don't even have a chance for regeneration."

"It's not a hypothesis. I can prove it. Even if they both had 10 years deducted, their birth times would be different. So why doesn't the wine of tales make adjustments for that?"

206 to 112.

Forty-seven people remained.

Igirin examined the glass orb. It was filled with black liquid. Since physical decomposition begins from the moment of death, if there were drowning victims, the technique would be as good as successful.

"Even a few hours, no, even just one second longer—if they can live even one second more, then the wine of tales is murder. It's nothing but drowning the subjects and defiling their corpses!"

The executor's eyes widened.

"Silence! Even if your words are correct, what would change! Life's value isn't determined by time! Are you telling us to deny Ra just to live one more second?"

"That one second is the one second of whether they put the period at the end of their life themselves or not! Why won't you think about that?"

Igirin saw this as an opportunity to recover.

243 to 75.

As expected, those who returned to belief increased.

Shirone had made a foolish judgment. To humans, having control over their own lives wasn't actually important.

What they wanted was purely benefit.

Gaining a little more lifespan brought nothing. The divine subjects would gladly leap into the wine of tales with hopes for the future.

As if proving the scale's numbers, the divine subjects hurled curses at Shirone.

"Damn! I almost got fooled! In the end, lifespan is predetermined! Nothing would change!"

"You've been going around deceiving people claiming to be Nephilim, and now you're spouting nonsense again? One second? What can you do with just one second? What could you do?"
