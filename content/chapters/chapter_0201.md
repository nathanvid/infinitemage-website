Shirone shakily raised his body upright. Though the load per unit area had dropped below 70 percent, it was an impossible feat without an indestructible mental fortitude.

The divine subjects looked at him with astonished eyes. While Rian's massive frame might have been understandable, seeing the small Shirone stand up was truly shocking.

"You people give even your lives to God! You'll do anything he commands! And yet just 1 second? If 1 second is so trivial to you! Then that being you call Godâ€”can't he show even 1 second of mercy to those who believe in him!"

Igirin clenched her molars hard.

159 to 159.

The ratio of faith to doubt was in perfect equilibrium. If even one more count fell, her authority would vanish.

Rian's movements became much lighter. Having withstood nearly 100 percent load, he could easily endure about 50 percent and swing his great sword.

Rian abandoned the statue and began striking the glass orb filled with black liquid. As he struck repeatedly, it cracked with sharp sounds and liquid began leaking out.

"Damn it! Damn it!"

The more this happened, the more anxious he became. The amount leaking from the cracks alone wasn't enough to prevent the subjects from drowning.

The divine subjects swallowed nervously as they watched this precarious tightrope walk between life and death.

It would surely have a negative effect on Igirin. Humans fundamentally want to side with the underdog.

Igirin used her last resort.

"Do not be deceived! The scales of my heart are judging you! If anyone here harbors doubt, I will personally reduce your lifespan by 50 years each!"

Fear, the most effective means of maintaining power, immediately restored the divine subjects' faith.

216 to 102.

Her authority began rapidly recovering.

As the load intensified, Shirone's knees bent again. He gritted his teeth and tried to endure, but it was an irresistible force.

What was most agonizing was that he could physically feel the divine subjects' attitudes turning against them.

"Shirone..."

At that moment, Kanya walked toward Shirone.

Her face was deathly pale. How could she be in her right mind when her mother was submerged in that black water?

"Really... can she live? My mom, I mean. Can she leave with a smile while me, Rena, and dad are watching?"

The divine subjects looked back and forth between Kanya and the glass orb.

Leaving with a smile while family members watched. The time needed for that was just 1 second.

"Of course. Mother's time to die hasn't come yet. We can meet again and smile together."

Tears flowed down Kanya's cheeks. Nothing else mattered now.

She just wanted to see her mom. She wanted to meet the mother she'd seen that morning just once more.

"Then please save our mom, Shirone. Please save my mom. I don't want this. I don't want mom to become a giant."

27 to 291.

Igirin's eyes widened at the shock that struck her brain like lightning. Her authority had plummeted to rock bottom.

Before she could even let out a gasp, the price of false pretension activated.

She fell vertically and slammed her knees into the ground. She couldn't move a single finger.

"Now! Everyone go and stop it!"

With the load gone, Shirone's group kicked off the ground and burst forward.

Time was running short. No, it had already been exceeded.

Rian smashed the glass orb with a full swing.

Amy turned off the liquid tank's switch.

When Tess thrust his thin sword into the device's gaps, an explosion occurred inside.

Family members rushed over to pull the subjects from the broken glass orbs. But covered in sticky liquid, their condition couldn't be determined.

The divine subjects approached with tense expressions. If they had died, decomposition would have already begun.

They couldn't find the courage to witness such a horrific sight.

The families began removing the liquid. Gradually, skin tone was revealed, and eyes, noses, and lips appeared.

Fortunately, decomposition hadn't progressed. Kanya's face became soaked with tears upon finding her mother.

"Mom, mom!"

Though not dissolved by the liquid, she wasn't breathing. Kanya's father rushed over and began artificial respiration.

When he opened her airway and compressed her stomach, thick liquid flowed back out and her mother coughed it up.

The divine subjects erupted in cheers.

At this moment, there were no laws in their minds. Only the joy that one life had returned to her family's embrace.

Dong. Dong. Dong.

The bell tolled, signaling the end of the wine of tales.

A reverent silence fell over the central square.

The revived subjects, supported by their families, looked up at the bell. According to the law, today was the last day of their lives, but no one had died yet.

**Age of Turbulence (1)**

The bell rang twelve times.

The sound of the bell settled as an unforgettable memory in the hearts of the divine subjects gathered in the central square.

They were still divine subjects who followed Ra's laws, but whether they could continue to do so in the future remained uncertain.

"Department Head! Are you alright?"

Phoebe flew to Igirin.

Seeing Igirin with her shattered knees, Phoebe felt guilty. She was ashamed of herself for doing nothing while her colleagues were fighting.

Igirin forced a smile, as if trying to comfort her shocked junior's heart.

"I'm fine. It's the price that activated when the irregular formula was destroyed. It's something I must bear. Are you alright?"

"Yes. I'm perfectly fine."

"That's a relief."

Phoebe couldn't bring herself to meet Igirin's eyes.

Even knowing that she hadn't participated in the battle, Igirin didn't even scold her and instead worried about her well-being.

Though the department head had always been burdensome to deal with, at this moment she couldn't help but acknowledge her.

Igirin surveyed the square with troubled eyes.

The tilted statue, the shattered glass orbs, the device with black smoke rising from it.

The wine of tales had been completely negated. Today had been a revolutionary day in Heaven.

'Perhaps this will have an even greater impact than when Miro came.'

The woman named Miro had been far stronger than the blonde boy. But precisely because of that, she hadn't acted rashly. She was someone who knew better than anyone what impact her actions would have on Heaven.

'What will happen now? An age of great upheaval is coming. Heaven will change starting from today.'

Phoebe suddenly blocked Igirin and took a fighting stance. Shirone's group was approaching.

Igirin couldn't move for the next 24 hours. Moreover, her knees were shattered. Whatever situation might arise, she must not show fear this time.

"G-go away! The fight is over! If you still want to attack, I'll face you myself!"

Igirin stopped Phoebe.

"It's alright, Phoebe. I want to talk with this boy too."

Feeling awkward, Phoebe quietly stepped aside and stood next to Igirin.

Shirone crouched down to match eye level as much as possible.

Having only seen flying fairies before, seeing them on the ground finally made him realize their size.

They really were only about a handful in size.

Igirin lifted her chin defiantly and spoke.

"Hmph! Child from the earthly world, just because I lost doesn't mean God's laws have been negated. I too am merely a middle-ranking member of the 72 fairy hierarchies, so today's victory won't deify you."

"That doesn't matter to me. I just wanted to save the life of someone who helped me. Is that such a wrong thing to do?"

Igirin didn't think it was wrong. But considering the future impact on Heaven, it was an issue she couldn't guarantee.

Is one life worth less than ten lives? Probably not. But what about 100 million? What judgment would one make for 1 billion lives?

Miro knew this fact. That's why she withdrew from Heaven. In the cruel reality where one must sacrifice one for the sake of many, she had found the only solution.

But this boy was different. He didn't consider efficiency when doing the right thing. It was surely the philosophy that human life cannot be valued.

Extreme goodness.

Igirin was feeling the same thing Arcane had felt before.

"Leave this place."

That was the only thing Igirin could say.

"You have brought chaos to Heaven. Even I cannot predict what will happen next. So leave. Disappear from our world as quickly as possible."

"But we..."

Before Shirone could finish speaking, red light flashed from the east.

The group turned toward it with surprised expressions.

A flash was rising from the Second Heaven Rakia. Judging by the distance, it was an enormous energy discharge.

Everyone in the square covered their ears.

A vibration that seemed like the world might end shook the heavens.

As if a spike had been driven down, the red flash pierced the center of the square. As the flash disappeared, an angel appeared with light wings torn to shreds.

Igirin's pupils shook with shock.

"Fallen angel Ikasa... Why are you here?"

The Second Heaven Rakia was where fallen angels were exiled.

Beings of the Second Heaven were permitted entry to the First Heaven, but it was extremely rare for fallen angels to come to the realm of divine subjects. Their pride as former residents of the Sixth Heaven wouldn't tolerate mingling with humans.

Igirin realized that the seeds of chaos Shirone had planted were already changing Heaven's laws.

"I am the lower angel Ikasa. While observing the sacred wine of tales, I confirmed the disturbance and descended to this land."

Shirone couldn't stop his body from trembling.

Over 2 meters tall with slanted eyes. Though beauty remained from when he had once been an angel, his temperament was too different from expectations.

If the angel he'd seen at Norse Refuge had reminded him of a brilliant sun, the angel who appeared now gave off an atmosphere like a setting sunset.

"So you are the one who denied God. Abominable creatures. Foolish beings who don't know what love they receive and blaspheme against God."

Ikasa glared at Shirone with hatred.

Fallen angels were beings of the Second Heaven, therefore ranking lower than the humans of the Third Heaven Shehaqim who had gained eternal life.

Giants and fairies were one thing, but to be inferior to humans? Why does God cherish humans so much?

The rage he had harbored for 20,000 years was on the verge of explosion.

"I will judge you on behalf of God."

Ikasa's sacred light body expanded into a 1-meter diameter halo. The massive ring of light became a rail, accelerating particles of light that sparkled like stars.

Igirin's face went pale. Though fallen angels had lost most of their power due to their sins, it still wasn't a force that could be handled at Shamain's level.

"Lord Ikasa! You mustn't! If a fallen angel opens their halo...!"

"Hohoho! The heretics will die anyway! Consider it an honor that I will handle it personally!"

Shirone's mind grew distant at the aura rising from Ikasa's body.

He could feel an absolutely insurmountable difference in power. This wasn't right. Such beings shouldn't exist in this world.

Shirone turned around with all his might. Time felt like it was flowing slowly, as if under a slow magic spell. The air expelled from his lungs hadn't yet reached his uvula.

When he was finally ready to make a sound, Shirone had only one thought in his mind.

"Run!"

Arin was already holding the Metagate, ready to operate the device.

But even for her, 1 second was far too long.

Faster! Even faster! She just needed to press the button with her finger, but the 2-centimeter distance wouldn't close.

Wind blew from behind Shirone. The Metagate in Arin's hands vanished like magic.

The group stopped in despair.

Beside Arin, Ikasa stood with his left hand on his hip, examining the Metagate in front of his eyes.

It wasn't that they couldn't see it. It wasn't light-fast or wind-swift either.

But it was certainly fast.

A speed somewhere between living beings and nature. It proved that they had been different from humans from the moment of their birth.
