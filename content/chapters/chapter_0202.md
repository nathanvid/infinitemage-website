Only Arin, who had been robbed of the Metagate at point-blank range, failed to understand the situation and stared down at her empty hands. She looked as if she didn't even realize a fallen angel was standing right beside her.

"Hmm, isn't this a Metagate? Even divine subjects are forbidden from using it. Not bad for heretics."

Arin's face turned pale upon hearing Ikasa's voice.

She had been over 30 meters away. How could the Metagate have been stolen from her?

Moreover, grabbing an object while moving at high speed meant she had accelerated using only physical strength.

"Hmm, the fact that you came here with a Metagate means... Don't tell me you... Did Miro send you?"

Shirone didn't answer. Instinctively, he felt that no information should be given to her.

"Hehe, you don't have to answer if you don't want to. I'll get the coordinates anyway once I analyze this."

The Metagate was high-tech equipment of the Mecca race. If dismantled using Mecca technology, they could determine what coordinates were recorded without even operating it.

Of course, Ikasa already had her suspicions. Especially that boy's action in stopping the wine of tales was masterful. They were definitely from that detestable Miro's homeland.

Ikasa swayed her slender figure as she passed between Shirone's group.

Though they were defenseless, no one could make a move.

Ikasa stopped where the women were standing.

As the tall angel looked down at her, Amy became extremely intimidated. However, she didn't give in to fear and continued the staring contest to the end.

"Are you by any chance a virgin?"

Amy's face flushed red. In terms of verbal violence, it was like a foul play.

"Wh-what?"

"Kekeke! Right. How about you two?"

Ikasa pointed alternately at Tess and Arin as she asked. Both their faces turned red without exception.

"Hmm, that's it, isn't it? For humans, your patience is quite remarkable."

Ikasa bent at the waist and examined Arin closely. Black hair, black pupils, and a white face reminiscent of moonlight.

"Oh, you're from an Eastern race. Very nice."

Ikasa was satisfied. She had initially come to vent 20,000 years of resentment, but unexpectedly gained an unexpected harvest.

The coordinates recording Miro's homeland and three girls. With this much, there was sufficient possibility of being promoted back to angel status.

Ikasa rotated her halo to activate her angelic abilities.

"Huh? Huh?"

As Amy, Tess, and Arin rose into the air, light reflexively gathered before Shirone's eyes.

"No! Stop it!"

As the Photon Cannon surged forward, Canis and Harvest launched a coordinated attack. Rian also charged forward with his great sword raised.

Ikasa extended her slender finger and drew it from left to right. Then all attacks bounced off an invisible barrier.

Shirone shouted, unable to shake off his anxiety.

"Release the women! Come down! Fight us!"

Ikasa looked at the group with disdain before flying high with the three girls.

Shirone felt like his heart would burst.

This couldn't end like this. If the situation concluded so helplessly, his heart wouldn't be able to bear it.

Ikasa, who had risen to the sky, accelerated her halo.

A burning whirlpool formed before her eyes, then a heavy mass was born. It was an object with a jet-black body crossed by orange-glowing bands, though its exact form couldn't be guessed yet.

"Tabu, kill the heretics. I'm going to Lord Kariel."

"...Yes, Lady Ikasa."

Ikasa quickly disappeared into the northern sky. Amy's voice calling for someone followed like a tail.

Shirone looked up at the sky with an expression that wasn't quite sane. It didn't feel real.

It wasn't that he hadn't prepared for danger when coming to heaven. But to be this powerless.

'I... It's because I suggested coming.'

Shirone squeezed his eyes shut.

It was his fault. He should have opposed coming to heaven from the beginning. To think that having a Metagate would make it somewhat safer. What foolish delusion. Angels were beings that transcended human imagination.

Kuuuuuung!

The black mass crashed to the ground. Its surface was so smooth it looked like rock. But when it unfolded its crouched body, a gorilla-like figure stood up.

Slender orange bands were carved in symmetrical patterns, and the color contrast was strangely nauseating.

The triangle floating above its head identified it as a Mara. Though much smaller than the Mara they had seen at Norse Refuge, it didn't feel weak.

"Kekeke! I am Tabu. It's been a while since I've had combat, so let's enjoy this thoroughly."

Shirone's group took battle positions. However, having lost the women, their fighting spirit had hit rock bottom.

Whether knowing their feelings or not, Tabu crouched down excitedly by himself.

"Though it's embarrassing to show off in a power-suppressed state..."

Tabu's orange bands glowed as intense heat exploded.

"It's more than enough for the likes of you."

With those words, Tabu kicked off the ground and charged.

Rian rushed forward and swung his great sword. Tabu neither dodged nor blocked. As if Rian were invisible, he rammed into the sword while maintaining his running posture.

Bang! With the sound of impact, Rian was flung into the sky.

Tabu bent backward to look at Shirone upside down. Then he launched his body in that position. The sight of Tabu's inverted face approaching was indescribably strange.

At this approach that exceeded human common sense, Shirone cast Photon Cannon. The curtain of light struck Tabu hard, but he broke through as if it didn't matter.

"Kekeke, interesting magic."

Tabu's face approached right in front of him. Where eyes should be, orange vertical lines ran through, and his mouth was split like a crack without even lips.

Though Photon Cannon spewed mass at the rapid speed of 20 times per second, Tabu was as leisurely as if facing wind and rain.

Extending his tongue down to his solar plexus, he mocked Shirone.

"Keke. Are you sad? Because your woman was stolen?"

Murderous intent settled in Shirone's eyes. He had to get Amy back.

Ironically, the moment he realized this fact, Shirone erased Amy from his mind.

As his mind gathered, the power of Photon Cannon strengthened.

This time, even Tabu couldn't endure it. Carried away by the cannon, he began to disrupt the battlefield with indescribably strange movements.

Creative? No, primitive.

With elastic movements like a monkey, delivering heavy attacks like a rock, Shirone's group could barely manage to defend each time.

'Is this the power of Mara?'

The power itself might be inferior to the whirlpool serpent, but if ranked, Tabu was much higher.

Speed, strength, balance, combat intelligence - he surpassed the whirlpool serpent, which was merely large in size.

If Ikasa hadn't lost her power, wouldn't this monster also have wielded near-catastrophic power?

The moment Tabu's fist flew toward Shirone, Shadow Wall erupted from the ground.

Bang! Noise burst from the opposite side of the shadow.

Tabu didn't withdraw his attack. He simply kept his fist in place and pushed in frantically.

His fist broke through Shadow Wall and struck Shirone's forehead.

Though the first defensive barrier absorbed the impact, he still felt the world spinning.

Canis emerged from Shirone's shadow.

"Ordinary attacks won't work. Open Immortal Function even now."

"What are you talking about? I opened it ages ago."

Canis made a bewildered expression. He knew best the power of Photon Cannon cast in Immortal Function state, having experienced it directly. Yet it couldn't even scratch him?

"Is laser impossible?"

"It would be difficult, wouldn't it? He's small and fast."

Energy concentration required over 5 seconds. Unlike the whirlpool serpent with its large size, it was an impossible tactic against Tabu, whose movement patterns couldn't even be predicted.

"Still, let's try. I'll try to stop him, so attack then."

Canis cast the authority of darkness. Shadows that gathered like capillaries grabbed Tabu's ankles, then climbed up his knees and firmly bound even his wrists.

As Shirone's laser targeted Tabu, his body gradually began to glow red. If he just stayed like this, no matter how great his durability, explosion would be a matter of time.

"Kahahaha! Satisfying! That's enough!"

When Tabu inflated his thighs and leaped, the authority of darkness binding his limbs tore like paper.

His figure instantly became a dot in the sky.

Was it still impossible? Though the authority of darkness specialized in engineering force, physical power wasn't its strong suit. To hold Tabu would require much stronger binding force.

"Canis! Buy me a little more time!"

Shirone decided to take a gamble on photon sculpting. Though it had been evaluated as inefficient, now that he had succeeded with Shining Impact, circumstances were different.

While Harvest faced Tabu, Canis watched the sphere of light gathering around Shirone.

Judging by the weak light intensity like Shining Impact, it was an attempt to sculpt by reducing particle vibration.

It was a decent idea, but would that thing really work?

—Even if you suppress vibration, you can't enlarge it to a sculptable size. Like Shining Impact, it'll end up exploding.

—No. It doesn't seem to be compression?

At Harvest's words, Canis turned his head again.

What Shirone sculpted with the sphere of light was a small ring that could be made with thumb and forefinger.

'That bastard! Don't tell me...?'

An amazing thought flashed through Canis's mind.

Surely light magic couldn't achieve the same precise modeling as dark magic.

But sculpting itself might not be impossible.

The ring of light Shirone created began to replicate itself repeatedly.

Watching this scene, chills ran down Canis's spine.

There it was - a form that could be created with photons.

Fractal structure.

Fractal refers to creating a whole by replicating one's own form.

Shirone had thought of gathering minimal particles to create the simplest form, then replicating it infinitely.

Once one form was completed, reproducing it was instantaneous.

From the sphere of light gathered between Shirone's palms, chains poured out like water streams.

Since it was a method that went against properties, mental power consumption was inevitably heavier than ordinary magic, but it was the only strategy he could attempt against Tabu.

Tabu, who had been chasing Canis, sensed something strange and looked back at Shirone.

Around Shirone, chains dozens of meters long were undulating while emitting light.

The power of light called angelic ability. Among them, the most difficult light sculpting.

"A mere human!"

Tabu roared and charged. Shirone also swung his arms and threw the chains to meet him.

Chains entangled in spherical form began to coil around Tabu's body. Starting from his ankles, wrapping around his waist, digging into his armpits. Then circling his neck and coming down in an X-shape to wrap around his thighs.

Clack! The sound of stone scraping rang out.

Tabu's fist stopped just before striking Shirone's nose bridge. His trembling fist represented his rage.

"Kruuuuuu!"

Tabu couldn't budge.

The chain links with gravity were pulling each other, strengthening the tensile force.

Even the slightest body movement would find gaps and tighten around him.

Fairy Department Head Igirin watched Tabu bound in chains of light with disbelieving eyes.

Just who was that boy?

Even among angels who handled light, only a few could wield sculpting techniques.

The situation was just as hard to believe for Canis.

It wasn't simple chains. Using fractal technology to form shape and generating tensile force using mass.

It was on a different dimension from Shirone's previous magic. Magic equivalent to Photon Cannon existed in other schools too. The same went for laser and Photon Cannon.

But chain magic was a unique domain of divine particles that no other school could replicate.

—The Unlocker's omniscience is evolving at a frightening speed. And every magic that comes out breaks common sense. After Shining Impact, now it's Shining Chain?

Canis remained silent. While having a comrade grow stronger was good in a situation where they needed to retrieve their friends, his innate competitiveness was feeling defeat.

—Canis, your heart is beating fast. Don't worry too much. You came to heaven to get stronger, right? You can definitely surpass Shirone.

—Right. I'll have to surpass him someday. For now, let's focus on the current situation.

Comforting himself this way, Canis walked toward where Tabu was bound.
