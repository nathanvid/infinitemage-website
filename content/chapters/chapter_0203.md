"Graaaah! This can't be happening! To think that I would fall to something like this...!"

Tabu curled his body with all his might.

As the tremendous physical force pulled at the chains, resistance immediately transmitted to Shirone's brain. It was terrifying brute strength.

Shirone used Diamond Body's durability to further increase the tensile force of Shining Chain.

Unable to withstand it, Tabu's body stretched wide as a scream of rage burst forth.

"GRAAAAAAAH!"

The price of resistance was great. The chains of light crushed through Tabu's hard surface as they dug in. His limbs bent at grotesque angles, and his waist curved at an impossible angle as if it would soon snap.

"Kek kek kek, kek kek kek kek."

Tabu was incredulous.

This was the first time in his life he had been reduced to such a miserable state. And by a mere human, no less.

"Fine, you've caught me. But what will you do now? You can't hold on forever, can you?"

Considering Tabu's durability, the only way to eliminate him was with laser. But the problem was that he couldn't cast other magic while Gravity Chain was being maintained.

Iruki, who had unique thought circuits, used Double Spirit Zone, but it was extremely difficult for a normal human to think two thoughts simultaneously.

Of course, there were rules with exceptions, but most magic inevitably had delays.

A prime example was being unable to cast other magic during teleportation.

Shining Chain in particular was a sustained magic that consumed mental power in real-time like Fire Wall, making it impossible to attack Tabu with other magic.

"Where did you take my friends?"

"To the angels' sanctuary. To birth Nephilim. Kek kek kek, too bad. Not your child though."

Shirone's eyes became bloodshot.

The word Nephilim didn't even register in his ears. Though he didn't understand the full situation, he could tell that something terrible was happening.

Tabu stuck his tongue out to its root and waggled it.

"Keke keke! Give up! You who struggle even against minor Mara will never save them. By now the women are in a miserable state... gack!"

As the chains of light tightened with powerful force, Tabu's neck twisted as if it would break.

A grinding sound came from Shirone's molars.

"Watch your mouth. I won't let it slide."

"Kahaha ha! How thrilling? But how about listening a bit more? This is an absolutely entertaining story! It's the real forbidden fruit!"

Shirone raised the tensile force to its limit.

He didn't know where the limit was, but right now he just wanted to make it impossible for Tabu to move his mouth.

"GRAAAAAAAH!"

A scream burst forth.

Irresistible force began crushing his body.

Tabu intuited it. This was his end.

"Don't get cocky. I will return. On the day when human corruption reaches its peak, I will come for you! Without fail... GRAAAAAK!"

CRACK CRACK CRACK!

Hair-raising sounds came from Tabu's entire body. Unlike human bones breaking, it was the sound of hard rock being crushed.

When Shining Chain disappeared, only Tabu's corpse remained. Like a clay doll squeezed by hand, his entire body was grotesquely twisted.

Canis felt his blood run cold at Shining Chain's power.

If it could crush Tabu to death, it could easily pulverize most living creatures. Like a rabbit caught in a trap, one's life and death would be stripped away.

As soon as he eliminated Tabu, Shirone collapsed face-down on the ground. He clutched handfuls of dirt with both hands while his shoulders trembled.

He felt neither the excitement of succeeding with magic nor the sense of achievement from defeating Tabu. Amy, Tess, and Arin had been kidnapped. And they said they would make them birth Nephilim.

A maddening impulse pounded his chest. It was the first time he had ever loathed himself this much.

Phoebe flew over to Shirone.

Being a magic user herself, she could roughly estimate how much immense mental power had gone into Shining Chain just now.

"Are you... okay?"

Phoebe asked courageously, but Shirone didn't even react. Listening carefully, she could hear him muttering "It's because of me."

For no reason, rage erupted in Phoebe as she pointed and launched into a lecture.

"You idiot! So why did you escalate things like this? Even if he's a fallen angel, he's a higher law than Shamain. What about the people in this area from now on! It's all because of you..."

"WAAAAHHH!"

Phoebe's shoulders jumped.

Shirone's face when he raised his head was a mess. Anger, resentment, and sadness mixed together made him look like someone falling off a cliff.

"Because of me... because of me Amy... Tess... Arin... All because of me."

Phoebe could no longer continue her lecture.

Shirone's eyes were not those of the living. There was no trace of the figure who had denied the wine of tales and shouted in defiance of Igirin.

"The women will be safe. For now, at least."

Shirone turned to look at Igirin. Unable to move as the price for her impersonation, she was immersed in thought with a serious expression.

"Safe? How can you say they're safe?"

"The reason Ikasa took the women is because they're virgins. They insert angelic information into the bodies of women who haven't given birth to conceive Nephilim."

Canis spoke up.

"Then isn't that more dangerous? You might not understand, but humans have something called chastity."

"What you're thinking won't happen. Angels consider having relations with humans shameful."

Rian said.

"Conversely, that means it's possible, right? There's no guarantee such things won't happen in the worst situation."

"Possibility and probability are different. Angels are a hermaphroditic species. Therefore they can have relations with humans, but they would never commit acts that bring dishonor under any circumstances."

Shirone found hope again in Igirin's words.

If angels were rulers who maintained principles and beliefs, there was still a chance for rescue. Moreover, depending on the situation, Amy's group might be able to create variables too.

Rian placed a hand on Shirone's shoulder.

"Shirone, how are you? Have you calmed down a bit now? It's the first time I've seen you this angry."

"Sorry, I got too excited. I should have thought about rescuing my friends first."

"It's okay. I wasn't in my right mind either."

Anyone would have reacted that way. Just as Amy was precious to Shirone, Tess was also a friend Rian relied on. And Canis too had someone he absolutely had to protect.

'Arin...'

Canis's heart was burning like never before.

This was the Arin he had protected even during the brutal life in Radum. Yet she had been taken away so easily.

Why hadn't he immediately rushed at Ikasa?

Because he had grown weak. Things like hope and a happy future had made his heart soft.

'Arin, wait just a little longer.'

Canis decided to return to his days as a stray dog in Radum. If another opportunity arose, he would focus on annihilating enemies without sparing his life.

Shirone asked.

"Tell me. How do I get to the angels' sanctuary?"

Phoebe asked incredulously.

"What are you planning to do with that information? Are you really thinking of going to rescue them?"

"Of course I have to go. Do you know the way?"

Of course she knew the method. She also had a rough idea of where Amy's group had been taken. But that's precisely why she knew Shirone couldn't go there. The angels' sanctuary was a place even Igirin couldn't enter without permission.

"They'll never let you in! Don't you understand? Whether it's heretics or Nephilim, if you go, you'll die!"

"We won't know until we try."

Phoebe beat her chest in frustration. Though Shirone had defeated the formidable enemy Tabu, angels were on a different level. With skills that couldn't even approach the fallen angel Ikasa, charging in would only lead to death.

"Get your head straight, you fool! The place you want to go is the Sixth Heaven Jebul! It's where real angels reside!"

Angels are strong. Not just stronger than anyone, but beings positioned at the apex of life from birth.

But Shirone had to go to the place where they lived. Amy was there, his friends were waiting.

"Phoebe, if you were dragged away by someone, how scared would you be?"

"What are you talking about, all of a sudden?"

"What do you think you'd be thinking? Wouldn't you desperately wait for someone to come rescue you? Wouldn't you take courage from the thought that your friends wouldn't abandon you?"

Shirone bit his lip.

"Maybe we can't save them. But we can't extinguish our friends' hope too. If we give up here, the captured people will have nothing left."

Phoebe couldn't accept it. No matter how you dressed it up with flowery words, the fact of dying wouldn't change.

If everyone was faithful to their own death, the world would be harmonious. Why do humans consider impossible things beautiful?

A Mecca man approached.

"The angels' sanctuary is the Sixth Heaven Jebul. Geographically, it's right next to Shamain. But since it's five levels higher, you can't enter directly. You'd have to go through procedures, moving through from the Second Heaven in order, which would take several days."

"We don't need procedures. How long would it take in a straight line?"

"A straight line, you say. Well, crossing Heaven's barriers would be impossible anyway, but if you went directly from here to the Sixth Heaven, it would take about a day."

It was much farther than expected. Judging by Ikasa's flight speed, she would have already reached her destination. In a situation where even entry to Jebul was uncertain, a day's delay was tantamount to a death sentence for the women.

"There's one method."

A man in his fifties approached. From his appearance and attire, he was a Norse.

"There's a method? What kind of method?"

"Going from here to District 1. It's the innermost district of Shamain. Since it's close to Heaven's center, if you enter Jebul from there following the central avenue, you can significantly reduce travel time."

Heaven was divided into six equal pie slices centered on Arabot. Therefore, the closer to Arabot, the shorter the arc length, allowing for dramatically reduced travel distance.

"How long does it take from here to District 1?"

"About 12 hours?"

Shirone became dejected again. Though it would be shorter than a day, it was still too far to attempt anything meaningful.

A smile formed on the Norse man's lips.

"If you go by ordinary methods, that is. There's a portal managed by Norse within Shamain. Using the light spots, you can reach District 1 in one go."

Such a method existed. Having traveled using light spots in Purgatory, Shirone realized the man's suggested method was the only viable solution.

"Please take us there. Are there any other problems?"

"If I had to point out something, it would be that it's strictly controlled by divine subjects. But I can resolve that. I'm the control officer working at that very place."

Shirone trembled, too stressed to even laugh at the joke. For the first time, hope emerged. Maybe... maybe he could save his friends.

Kanya approached with tears flowing.

"I'm sorry, Shirone. It's because of our family for no reason. But... thank you. Really..."

Shirone wiped away Kanya's tears. Though his friends were in danger as the price for denying the wine of tales, how could it be the divine subjects' fault?

True power holders hide behind systems and remain invisible. He knew where his arrows of rage should be directed.

"It's not your fault. I'll definitely save my friends, so don't worry."

"Wait a moment!"

Rena came running from the crossroads of the plaza. She was carrying Signa and Exd, Mecca equipment.

"I brought these just in case. I thought they might help."

Though Mecca items had personalized passwords, swords and shields belonged to shared equipment that anyone could use. Though lending was prohibited by law, with the wine of tales broken, no one cared.

The equipment would be necessary for Rian.

Magicians had gimmicks to overturn situations, so they could create variables even when fighting strong enemies, but swordsmen had only honest force. As such, equipment played a large role.
