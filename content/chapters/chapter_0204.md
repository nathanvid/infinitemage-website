Rian took the Signa and Exd and examined them. Relying on another person's weapon was a matter that hurt a swordsman's pride, but Rian wasn't the type to worry about such things when his friends were captured.

"Thank you. But I might treat them roughly."

"It's okay. No, it doesn't matter if they break. Please save the sisters."

Phoebe fell into thought.

Just moments ago, these were divine subjects who worried about their lifespans decreasing day by day.

But what about now? Each one was shouldering risks to crush another's misfortune.

Why does the law control humans?

Maintaining population numbers, controlling lifespans, unable to even leave heaven. What kind of danger does the increase in human numbers pose to Ra?

"Are you really going?"

Phoebe couldn't understand herself for asking such a thing.

Everything had changed since meeting Shirone. He was chaos. A boulder thrown into heaven's tranquil waters.

"You know I have no choice but to go. Thanks for earlier. For avoiding the fight. Actually, I didn't want to fight you either. The way you lightened Kanya and Rena's punishment too—it seems like we understand each other."

Phoebe deliberately turned away from Shirone's words. She didn't want to hear about understanding each other.

How could a fairy and a human understand each other?

"Take good care of the divine subjects from now on. If I return safely, then we can become closer friends."

Shirone turned his body toward an uncertain future.

Phoebe's small heart pounded. Shirone's figure following the Norse became blurry as if veiled in mist.

"Would you save me too?"

Shirone looked back at Phoebe. She hesitated, then gathered courage to ask again.

"If I were captured, would you come save me? I mean... if we're friends?"

Shirone smiled warmly and said, "Of course."

Phoebe lowered her head. Was it really that obvious? Then Shirone would die.

He was walking toward death.

"Even if you go to Zone 1, you won't be able to pass through Jebul's gates. I have a way to save the girls. So I'll go with you."

Shirone's eyes widened.

She definitely said there was a way to save them. Right now, he couldn't even imagine what method it might be.

"Really? Can you really save them?"

"I can't guarantee it. But if you go by yourselves, you'll definitely die, so that's why I'm offering to go with you."

Shirone looked at Phoebe with a moved expression. Phoebe's face reddened as she turned her head away angrily.

"Hmph! Don't get any strange ideas. I just felt a sense of responsibility to see this incident through to the end."

Igirin calmly accepted the situation unfolding before him.

The divine subjects helping Shirone, and Phoebe being drawn to humans—both were against the law.

'So it comes to this after all? No, if this too is an inviolable law...'

Igirin, having made his decision, opened his mouth.

"Phoebe, come to me."

Phoebe's shoulders flinched. Now she realized she had made decisions without the department head's permission.

Contrary to expectations, Igirin didn't get angry. Instead, he closed his eyes and transmitted memories to Phoebe.

New information began settling into Phoebe's mind one by one.

"This is...?"

"Phoebe, take my memories with you. They will help you move within Jebul."

Memory transfer between fairies was common, but when a higher rank transferred to a lower rank, it held special meaning. It was like a proxy appointment letter, telling her to fulfill the mission in his place.

A veteran of the 72 fairy ranks. Realizing the sincerity of her sky-high senior, Phoebe recalled her own appearance, filled with complaints and dissatisfaction until now, and bowed her head.

"I'm sorry, Department Head. For disappointing you again."

"I have never been disappointed in you. You are a fairy born in heaven's age of turbulence. From now on, everything that happens will be different from the laws you know. So you must see everything with your own eyes and make judgments."

Phoebe's eyes became moist with emotion. For the first time in her life, she saw Igirin's smile.

"You have a tendency to be reckless, but that's why you learn things for yourself. Remember that a spiral looks in all directions while moving straight ahead. I believe in you, Phoebe."

Phoebe wiped away her tears and nodded vigorously.

The fact that she had received Igirin's recognition raised her courage a hundredfold.

Shirone's group left the square with Phoebe.

The place where the portal control officer arrived was a Norse building not far from the central square.

The interior was complex like a maze, with magic circles drawn in each room and different spirits residing in each.

Opening an iron door installed in a corner and entering, a light spirit floated alone in the center of the dark room.

The control officer approached and gently grasped the spirit. As the spirit's movement stopped, his arm began glowing white.

"Using the spirit's power, we can reach Zone 1 in one go. But gathering the essence takes time. It'll take about 5 minutes."

Having experienced this in Purgatory, there were no particular questions.

While waiting, Shirone observed Phoebe floating at eye level. She was pointing her small bottom this way and fluttering her transparent wings.

Shirone raised his index finger and poked her cute little bottom.

Phoebe jumped in surprise and covered her bottom with both hands.

"Hey! What are you doing right now?"

Though she was a one-year-old fairy smaller than a palm, she was still a girl it seemed. Of course, he had no intention of teasing her. Excluding the parts where her wings moved, that was the only remaining area.

"Thank you for helping. Let's get along well from now on. Thanks to you, I have hope."

Phoebe pouted her lips. But perhaps reading Shirone's sincerity, she turned back toward the light essence.

The waiting 5 minutes passed slowly. This phenomenon was also relativity of time.

Canis asked Phoebe, "That guy Tabu, is he really dead? No, to be precise, is Mara a being that can be killed? Before he died, that bastard said something about human corruption and coming back again."

Shirone suddenly became curious too. No, it was a crucial question. If Mara was a being that couldn't be eliminated, then even the combat approach would have to change.

"Hmm, how should I explain this? It's elimination, but not eternal death."

"Explain it simply."

"Mara is a being made of concepts, so even if he dies, he'll be revived someday. In heaven, we call that initialization."

"How long does initialization take?"

"It's not specifically determined, but he won't revive immediately."

"So if we kill him, he dies."

"That's right. But approaching it from another angle..."

"That's enough. That's all I need to know for now."

Canis thought of nothing but combat. To get Arin back, he had to become stronger than now.

He began simulating to increase mental power by the second. This was a concept called sequence formula at magic school.

"Yeah yeah, think whatever you want."

Phoebe waved her hand as if to say do whatever.

Shirone thought getting more information was more important than sequence formulas.

Above all, there was still a story he hadn't heard.

"You said there was a way to save my friends? What method? You can tell me now, right?"

Phoebe rested her chin on her hand and fell into thought.

Honestly speaking, it was an operation that couldn't guarantee success. But it was much more realistic than rushing defenseless into the angels' residential area.

"Rather than a method, there's someone who loves humans very much. I thought maybe they could help you."

The control officer announced that preparations for casting ancient magic were complete.

Walking into the mass of light, Shirone couldn't contain his curiosity and asked again, "Really? Who is that person?"

Phoebe spoke with a reverent heart, "The leader of the angels, Archangel Ikael."

The pillar of light ascended.

**The Eternal and Immortal Ra (1)**

After parting with the administrator at Shamain's exit and walking for about 30 minutes, they arrived at the walls where the tall tower of Seventh Heaven Arabot could be seen.

Phoebe said the girls would be in Sixth Heaven Jebul. Virgin conception was accomplished through the wine of life, and the one who managed that was Archangel Kariel.

Shirone said, "How do we enter Jebul? There's no way to pass through the gates."

"Right. That's why we'll enter through Arabot."

"If we can't even enter Jebul, how can we enter where God lives?"

"That's why we'll get help from Ikael. Since she was even a seraph, maybe she'll let us in if we plead."

"That's even stranger. No matter how much of an archangel she is, she's a being of the Sixth Heaven, so how can she open the gates of the Seventh Heaven?"

"That's because Ikael is currently staying in the Seventh Heaven."

Shirone tilted his head. It was unexpected that an archangel would be in Arabot, leaving her own territory of Jebul.

"Are there circumstances we don't know about?"

"Yes. Ikael committed some sin and was stripped of her seraph qualifications. But because Ra loved her so much, instead of making her fall as a fallen angel, he exiled her to Arabot."

It was quite a shocking story. From his experience so far, when he imagined the being called God, it was a stern judge who put laws first.

It was strange that such a God made an exception, but the fact that she was exiled to Arabot rather than the Second Heaven was also peculiar.

"What kind of angel is she? What sin did she commit?"

"I don't know that either."

"What? How can you not know? If she rose to become a seraph, it would have been a huge issue."

"It probably was. But we all forgot about it. We only know the fact that Ikael committed a great sin and is now exiled in Arabot."

Shirone felt something eerie in Phoebe's words. Forgetting meant that they originally knew but their memories were erased.

Even if someone's memory was erased, someone else would pass on that information. Given the speed of information propagation, this couldn't happen without simultaneously erasing everyone's memories.

Rian said, "After lifespans, even memories? That's literally omniscient and omnipotent. How old is this God? About 100 million years old?"

"Age is meaningless to God. He is the beginning of everything. We don't know the beginning. Since we don't know the start, we don't know the age either."

Canis said, "It doesn't matter. We're not going to fight God. We'll come back as soon as we save the girls."

Shirone took note that Canis said "girls" rather than just Arin. Though they usually bicker, it seemed he had unconsciously grown fond of them.

The group arrived at Arabot and looked up at the walls. Though it was heaven's inner castle, the walls were higher than the outer castle. Moreover, there was no visible device to summon Ikael.

Canis said, "Don't tell me we have to wait until that woman takes her dog for a walk or something?"

"Hmph! Your arrogance will only last for now! Without Ikael's help, you can't even enter Jebul."

Though she was helping Shirone, Phoebe was heaven's internal affairs officer. She couldn't tolerate disparaging the archangel who was respected enough by the divine subjects that Ra erased the memory of her sins.

Shirone said, "I'll apologize for him. He's just on edge. But what do we do now?"

Knowing their situation was urgent, Phoebe didn't snap back further.

"Alright! Then I'll try to communicate with Ikael now."

Shirone's eyes lit up as he asked back, "Huh? You can do that?"

"No, I can't."

"...Are you joking right now?"

"I can't help that it's the truth. But it's not completely impossible. Ikael might be watching us."
