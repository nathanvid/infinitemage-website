What was this supposed to mean?

From Arabot to here was blocked by barriers, and the distance was immense. No matter how good Ikael's eyesight might be, there was absolutely no chance she could be watching this place.

"Don't be so disappointed. For angels, 'seeing' is different from human 'seeing.' There are various perspectives of 'seeing,' and among them, 'looking down' is the ability to see whatever you want to see. In other words, angels can see everything if they want to."

It was hard to imagine.

According to Phoebe, it meant that if you thought about wanting to see something, you would just see it.

Even the hundred-eyed monster from fairy tales didn't torment princes with such absurd abilities.

"It's true. The reason Ikasa arrived first when the wine of tales was broken was because she was looking down at Shamain. Well... she's still stuck as a fallen angel because she's so petty."

Since fallen angels living in the Second Heaven ranked below even the fairies living in the Fourth Heaven, Phoebe criticized Ikasa without restraint.

It showed how far an angel with the highest position in Heaven could fall when they committed a sin.

"But if they can see whatever they want to see, doesn't that mean angels know everything in the world?"

"Not necessarily. Deciding what to look at is difficult. Think about it. Even if you could look down, would you be able to grasp the entire world?"

"No. That would be difficult."

Shirone recalled when an angel had come to Norse Refuge.

Gardrak had said this: If an angel wanted to, they could discover this place, but such a thing would never happen.

"No one checks their own fingerprints daily."

"Oh? You knew that story? That's exactly it. Anyway, if Lady Ikael is looking down at this place, she might respond to my voice."

Canis was displeased. Mages inherently disliked relying on probability, but this case was too extreme.

"It's such a slim chance. This place might be her fingerprint. Besides, even if she is looking down, where's the guarantee that she'll help us?"

"There's no guarantee. I came along to give you even a thread of hope. What awaits us where we're going is Archangel Kariel. Do you understand what that means? You could never win even if you died and came back to life."

Shirone faced reality. If the one holding his friends was an archangel, they needed to secure at least an ally of the same level to have any chance of escape.

"Alright. Let's try this method. I'll trust you."

Thinking that Norse people were really suspicious, Phoebe clicked her tongue. Anyway, she had also taken action seeing some possibility.

No angel checks their fingerprints daily, but Ikael might be different. She was said to be compassionate and often looked down upon divine subjects.

"Then I'll start. Once the conversation begins, absolutely don't interfere. I don't want to commit blasphemy against an archangel."

Closing her eyes, Phoebe concentrated. Her plea spread out in concentric circles.

Shirone waited anxiously. But even after five minutes passed, no particular change occurred in Phoebe.

Was it impossible after all?

Rather than disappointment at failure, the fear of losing hope for rescuing his friends was much greater.

Just as the group's hearts were sinking into despair, Phoebe's body trembled.

Soon after, hot tears streamed down from her closed eyes.

"Ah, Lady Ikael."

Shirone turned to look at Phoebe as if his neck might break.

A conversation with Ikael had definitely begun. He barely managed to hold back all sorts of sounds that wanted to come out, remembering Phoebe's request.

Phoebe and Ikael conversed for quite a long time. She kept nodding and sometimes even spoke aloud in response.

"Yes, I understand."

Phoebe kept her eyes closed with a smiling face for a long time. Unable to emerge from her emotion, she suddenly opened her eyes and made a fuss.

"Did you hear? Did you hear? She accepted my conversation! My conversation!"

"Of course we couldn't hear. What did she say?"

"Ah, Lady Ikael... looked down upon me!"

Looking at Phoebe gazing up at the sky with moist eyes, Shirone couldn't bring himself to ask. Only after letting her explode with emotion until she was ready could he speak up.

"So, will she release my friends?"

Phoebe suddenly snapped to attention. She had been so absorbed in the fact that she had conversed with an archangel that she had forgotten the most important content.

Phoebe's expression became a bit dejected.

"No. Lady Ikael said she cannot take even one step out of her room because she has committed a sin."

"What? So it failed after all?"

Phoebe tried to put on a bright expression.

"But she said she would help us. We'll be able to enter Arabot. However, there's one condition..."

As she hesitated and watched Shirone's group's reactions, Canis, who had reached the limit of his patience, snapped.

"What? We don't have time, so speak quickly."

"She said she wants to meet only the boy named Shirone separately. But who is Shirone?"

Canis and Rian looked at Shirone.

Phoebe still didn't know anyone's names. Knowing that names were crucial for controlling lifespans, they had been thoroughly hiding their names while acting.

When Phoebe saw the two people's gazes point to one person, she widened her eyes in surprise.

'So his name was Shirone.'

Until just moments ago, Shirone had been nothing more than a collection of countless concepts in Phoebe's eyes.

It was a vague and abstract feeling, like fog that couldn't be grasped.

But now it was different.

Shirone.

The moment she thought of those three syllables, things like Shirone's actions, thoughts, and emotions integrated and struck her mind.

"Only Shirone should come? Is there a special reason?"

"I don't know either. I wanted to ask, but somehow it seemed like she didn't want to reveal that."

Canis thought this was actually better. To use the pressing time effectively, focusing on individual missions would be more efficient than moving as a group.

"Then Shirone goes to meet Ikael. Without her help, escape seems impossible anyway."

"What about you guys?"

"We'll go to Jebul. From Seventh Heaven to Sixth Heaven should be a free pass. We'll go to where Amy is first. If necessary, we might be able to buy some time."

It was the best strategy they could devise in the current situation.

Once the agreement was reached, Shirone looked at Phoebe. It meant he wanted her to let him enter Arabot.

But Phoebe didn't know the method either.

Just as she was stuttering in confusion, trying to think of excuses, the surroundings were engulfed in bright light.

Phoebe clenched her hands in emotion.

"Ah... Lady Ikael."

A massive light swallowed Shirone's group.

Where the light that had been sucked toward a point disappeared, nothing remained.

@

Seventh Heaven Arabot.

Shirone looked around with a trembling heart. He had arrived at the most sacred place in Heaven.

The top of the spire was hidden by clouds and couldn't be seen. Phoebe had said that Anke Ra dwelled at that end.

Her voice explaining this was also trembling.

"To come to the place where God's throne is located. This is the most glorious day of my entire life."

"You've only lived for one year though?"

Phoebe glared at Canis.

"Whether it's one year or a hundred years, age doesn't matter. This isn't a place you can come to just because you've lived long."

"But isn't it too quiet for that? You said God lives here, but there aren't even any guards."

"Huh? What do you mean?"

"Well, even though a being called God lives here, no one is guarding it."

Phoebe suddenly stopped and stared at Canis with a blank expression. It was like hearing that one plus one equals window.

"Are you serious? Ra protects us. How could we protect God?"

Shirone belatedly realized and nodded.

"Ah. I see."

Ra was not a king as spoken of in the human world.

If he was a universal absolute being, even having someone protect him would diminish his divinity.

Shirone's group, having arrived at Arabot's spire, prepared to separate for their respective missions.

Ikael wanted to meet with Shirone alone. Since an archangel's help was absolutely necessary to retrieve Amy's group, Rian and Canis had no complaints about the discrimination.

Phoebe, who had the mission of guiding Shirone to Ikael's room, shared the memories she had obtained from Igirin with Canis and Rian.

A rough map of Jebul was imprinted in their minds.

"The place where the girls are should be the Great World Hall at the eastern end. That's where Lord Kariel resides."

Canis traced through Igirin's memories to find the location of the Great World Hall. Even going by teleportation, it was a distant location. But the real problem wasn't the distance.

"What you need to know is that not just anyone can enter the Great World Hall. Since it's a place that governs the movements of the world, it's surrounded by the highest level security devices."

"Security devices? You mean there are obstacles?"

"If it were that level, I wouldn't even mention it. Simply put, the Great World Hall probably isn't in Jebul."

"Please don't irritate me and explain it comprehensibly."

"Some technology of the Mecha System can change the information of specific spaces. Simply put, it's been sent to another dimension. To enter the Great World Hall, you need to shut down the Mecha System first."

"How do we shut it down?"

"Looking at the map of Jebul, there's a portal that goes to Ingris. It's a place that controls all information in Heaven, and you should be able to shut down the Mecha System there too."

"Huh? Ingris?"

It was a place he had heard when making a contract with the Kergo chieftain. Cadum had asked him to convey his will to Ingris, but he hadn't paid attention at the time. Since he hadn't received anything, there was no obligation to fulfill the contract either.

Seeing how things turned out, he thought rejecting their hospitality was an excellent judgment.

But for Canis, Ingris had special meaning.

It was the reason he had come to Heaven even abandoning the Metagate, and the presumed place where Arcane had obtained the knowledge that allowed him to ascend to Grand Mage.

While analyzing the memo his master had left, the field Canis had focused on was mythology.

If Heaven was a place that had influenced humanity from long ago, those records would be embedded in myths, not history.

While studying ancient texts this way, he realized there was a place that commonly appeared in different myths.

That place was Ingris.

It was the hall of knowledge where all the secrets of the world were said to be recorded.

"I'll take that place. While Rian goes to the Great World Hall, I'll disable the Mecha System. I should be able to buy some time."

It sounded good to say buying time, but it was no different from telling him to enter a deathtrap.

But Rian thought this was exactly what he could do best.

"I agree. We'll go to Jebul now. Shirone, you must find a way no matter what."

"Yeah. You guys be careful too. I'll come as quickly as possible."

Without even time to watch his friends head to Jebul, Shirone entered the tower.

A vast interior without even pillars spread out. The floor was made of glass material, without a single footprint or speck of dust.

Phoebe relied on the memories Igirin had transmitted to lead Shirone toward a corner of the tower.

"Huh? Why isn't there anything here?"

According to the memories, there should definitely be an elevator in this spot. But looking around, there were no visible devices.

At that moment, light leaked from cracks in the floor, and a blinding light flashed.

Shirone looked around at the suddenly changed scenery.

The place he had arrived at had corridors stretching like a fish's spine. Every ten meters, paths branched off to both sides, and at the end of the corridor stood a golden iron door.

Phoebe looked at Shirone in front of the iron door.

"From here on is Lady Ikael's domain. As promised, I cannot enter. Since angels can communicate with all beings, there shouldn't be any need for me. Just in case, I'll also send you a map of Jebul."
