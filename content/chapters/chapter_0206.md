Shirone closed his eyes and received the memories that Phoebe conveyed to him. It was a warm feeling.

"Thank you, Phoebe."

If it hadn't been for Phoebe, he wouldn't have been able to make it this far. If he successfully rescued Amy and her group, Shirone would gladly give all the credit to Phoebe.

"Hmph! What about me? I just followed along because what you were doing was so interesting. Just know that I absolutely won't care about it anymore from now on."

Though Phoebe refused to acknowledge it until the end, Shirone knew. Her heart was tender and pure. That's why, despite enjoying her long lifespan, she couldn't ignore human suffering.

"Phoebe, you'll surely become a wonderful fairy."

"Enough. Just hurry up and go in. I'm tired and don't want to stay here any longer."

Phoebe stepped aside toward where the door was opening. She was curious about the interior, but didn't dare have the courage to look around an angel's room.

As Shirone entered the room, the iron door closed with a thud.

Though only one door separated them, Phoebe felt as if Shirone had disappeared from the world.

When she realized that no one was left around her, loneliness overwhelmed her. Was the pinnacle of the world such a lonely place?

"Tch. I'm going back, whatever."

Phoebe, having collected her troubled thoughts, took the light elevator and arrived at the first floor.

When she reached Shamain, she would have to report to Igirin. She had to protect her until the price of impersonation ended. And if she went to sleep, the next day would continue with the same routine as always.

Thud. Thud.

The ground shook at the entrance Phoebe was heading toward. It was the sound of someone entering.

Just from the sound, Phoebe's face turned pale.

Though only shadows were visible, it was definitely a giant. If the ground was shaking this much, just how big could they be?

One giant revealed himself from the entrance.

Unlike what she had expected, his build wasn't large.

His height was just a little over 2 meters, which by giant standards was worse than a dwarf.

However, judging from his proper attire, his level in the wine of tales seemed quite high.

Broad shoulders and a developed lower jaw. His forearms were solid as rocks and his eyes blazed.

Phoebe, who realized the giant's identity through original knowledge, forgot even to flap her wings. Then, just before falling, she barely regained her balance and flew up.

'My goodness... who am I looking at right now?'

It was Ymir, the King of Giants.

The reason the ground vibrated despite his not-so-large build was because the muscles composing his body were that heavy.

The historically strongest giant, said to have over ten thousand humans in his wine of tales, was approaching.

Ymir's pace gradually quickened upon discovering Phoebe.

Though a giant's status was lower than angels and Mara, Ymir was different.

According to original knowledge, he was said to have destroyed several worlds with only the power of his physical body.

In terms of pure force alone, he was a being with power above that of a mid-level angel.

Phoebe swallowed her saliva and waited for Ymir to arrive.

When he stopped with a thud of his foot, a greeting came out without her realizing it.

"Ah, ah, ah, hello."

Phoebe was filled with regret at her rash judgment.

Though giants were from the Fifth Heaven Matei and fairies from the Fourth Heaven Makhon, in reality they were in a relationship that maintained balance from positions of정 and 신.

Therefore, fairies had no need to bow to giants, and rather, whenever they met, they would check each other and exchange harsh words.

"Who are you?"

"Ah, I'm Phoebe, a spiral spirit."

Phoebe gulped. She couldn't know what kind of harm this giant, who was a sworn enemy, might do.

But contrary to her expectations, Ymir greeted her warmly.

"Ah, I've heard of you. I heard an oddball was born in the fairy realm, and that must be you."

It was the first time she'd heard such a thing. It seemed to be a conversation that had taken place between higher laws.

But calling her an oddball... What had she done to receive such an evaluation from above?

"You're cute. So, what business brought you all the way to Arabot?"

"Ah, I'm handling a proxy mission for Fairy Department Head Igirin."

Phoebe deflected like that. Of course it was true, but she felt guilty as if she had sold out Igirin.

But now was the time to mobilize even nonexistent connections to defuse the situation.

"I see. I heard Ikasa came to Shamain. They caught some heretics, right?"

"Yes, it seemed like it. Oh, by any chance, do you know what happened to the women who were captured?"

Phoebe wanted to hit her lips that were moving contrary to her thoughts.

What was the point of asking such a thing now?

She had already finished what she could do, and all that was left was to return home.

But contrary to her heart, her ears were perked up to catch Ymir's words.

"They seem to be in Kariel's laboratory. I heard they found a Metagate. Because of that, the Great World Hall seems to be in an uproar."

Not using honorifics when speaking of the Archangel Kariel was clear impiety, but Ymir didn't care. That alone showed what a great warrior he was.

"Ah, I see. But what do you mean by uproar?"

"They say the lost coordinates are remembered in the Metagate. I'm not interested in difficult stories, but war will break out soon. That's why I came to plead with Ra. To return my body."

"Ah, I see."

The story of Ymir having his body taken away was famous in Heaven.

If Ikael had his power taken away for committing a great sin, Ymir had his original body confiscated simply for being strong.

Ymir was strong. Too strong. So Ra had no choice but to set limits on Ymir's physical body.

This was also against the law, one of the few exceptional incidents in Heaven's history.

When Ymir suddenly raised his hand, Phoebe flinched and closed her eyes. It felt like a giant barrier was approaching.

But what she felt was a gentle touch. The giant's finger stroked Phoebe's head.

"War is inevitable anyway. When war begins, fight alongside me. If you stay by my side, no enemy will be able to touch you."

"Ah, yes. I'll do that."

As Ymir passed by Phoebe with a smile in his eyes, the ground began to shake again with thud, thud sounds.

Only after he reached the platform and disappeared as fragments of light could Phoebe finally let out a sigh of relief.

"Phew, I managed to get through that safely anyway."

Though it was embarrassing to be scared of a giant, she could say she was dignified enough when facing Ymir.

She tried such rationalization, but... honestly, it was a memory she wanted to erase.

Phoebe shook her head and left Arabot. The route to Shamain was quickly drawn in her mind.

But she was looking somewhere else. Her mind was confused again.

Great World Hall. Metagate. War.

Words she never thought she'd hear since the wine of tales was broken kept coming up.

Phoebe flew around, conflicted. The desire to run away clashed with the feeling that she shouldn't.

Shirone's voice echoed in her head.

-You'll surely become a wonderful fairy.

Phoebe grabbed her head and shook it. But the words already embedded in her thoughts couldn't be easily shaken off.

"Ugh, really! I'm going crazy!"

Phoebe flew at high speed. One fairy headed toward Jebul, the resting place of angels.

@

Anke Ra remained in the spire of Arabot.

An omniscient and omnipotent being who could freely control the lifespan of divine subjects and even govern their memories.

Ymir had climbed the tower to have an audience with that great being.

Ymir, the King of Giants.

The strongest giant in Heaven's history.

The wine of tales was divided into a final 10 stages until reaching the perfection of life. And Ymir was the only giant in history to reach the unprecedented final 10th stage.

Even such a Ymir couldn't help but be nervous when faced with the throne of God where Anke Ra resided.

The top floor that soared as if to pierce the sky was less than one hundredth the area of the first floor.

All that was visible to him after arriving via the light platform was a crude iron door.

"Anke Ra, your servant requests an audience."

Ymir waited for a while.

The iron door began to tremble, then the central gap opened and it opened inward.

Ymir moved forward without hesitation.

Thud. Thud. Thud.

Expanding sounds were heard regularly. It was a muffled sound as if beating a loose drum.

It was a room of barely 100 pyeong.

Hair-thin nerve bundles filled the floor gaps and spread in all directions, while intestine-like hoses hung down from the walls.

The nerves on the floor stood up and groped at Ymir's ankles, then fell away as if losing interest.

Ymir knelt on one knee before Ra.

"Giant Ymir pays respects to Anke Ra."

Thud. Thud. Thud.

The massive chunk of flesh beyond Ymir's shoulder pulsed like a heart and greeted him.

Weight: 26 tons. It was reddish-brown surrounded by mucus, and its form was a featureless collapsed shape.

While the center was bulging, the ends were like deflated balloons.

Intestinal bundles extending from the ends filled the walls, and nerves extending from there spread across the floor, surging like waves.

Ra's physical body seemed as if all the organs that make up life had been combined.

It was both heart and brain, both digestive and sensory organ.

Ra's nerves began to flail wildly around Ymir. Then the center of the flesh chunk bulged and tore horizontally with a squelching sound. The skin opened wide up and down as a giant eyeball protruded.

Anke Ra (The Eternal and Immortal Ra, estimated age unknown).

The iris of a pupil the size of a human face narrowed and expanded to focus.

Then a high frequency that seemed to pierce eardrums leaked out.

"Squeak! Giant... Squeak! Ymir, why have you... Squeak! come to me."

Despite the noise like scraping nails on steel plate, Ymir's expression didn't change at all.

"Heretical groups have entered sacred Heaven. Those who denied the wine of tales have been handed over to Kariel and are preparing to receive the wine of life."

"I... know."

Ra's voice gradually stabilized. Though still high-pitched, no more noise was mixed in.

Ra knows everything. Therefore, Ymir judged that he hadn't received an answer yet. But no matter how long he waited, no words came from Ra.

"What is your intention?"

"Nothing. Must I... concern myself?"

"It's an exceptional matter. Coordinates of worlds that couldn't be infiltrated until now are recorded in the Metagate. This is an excellent opportunity to convey Ra's will."

"Y-mi-r."

During those three syllables, Ra's voice tone dropped rapidly, then a magnificent voice followed.

"I am the beginning and end of the world. Everything is connected to me, so there is no need to concern myself with anything."

Ymir pressed his lips tightly shut.

Ra is omniscient and omnipotent. Therefore, any event would be included within his domain. But he couldn't retreat without regaining his body.

"I wish to have my body returned. Please melt the eternally unmelting ice wall."

"Ymir, were you not my servant?"

"Do not misunderstand. Giants are those who uphold the law. This too is to uphold Heaven's law."

"I refuse."

Ymir raised his head with burning eyes. But when he met Ra's giant single eye, all emotions scattered.

"One step of a giant might be noisier than the impious actions of a billion heretics. Especially if the owner of that step is Ymir, King of Giants."

"Do you doubt my loyalty? Do you think I would rebel against great you?"

"Ymir, you are the one who should not misunderstand. Your power disrupts the balance of the world. Do not forget that law exists to maintain the whole."

With those words, Ra closed his eye. The membrane gap sealed completely as the intensity of the pulsing increased.

Thud. Thud. Thud.
