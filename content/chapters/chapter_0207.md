Ymir knew that the time allotted to him had come to an end.

As he slowly turned his body, his eyes were carved with indescribable frustration and anger.

If Ra said it was so, then it was so.

But his intuition was telling him a different story from Ra. No, he was realizing the truth that Ra was hiding.

'I must confirm it with my own eyes.'

Ymir headed toward Jebul, the city of angels.

Shirone, who had entered Ikael's room, looked around.

It was different from what he had imagined. The scene of the room with a table and chair, bed and carpet laid out was no different from where humans lived.

Even so, he didn't think it belonged to humans.

Sunlight clung to every object. As if isolated from the flow of time, not a single minor flaw was visible.

The feeling of seeing perfectly flawless objects was truly strange.

It was a fineness that human eyes could not confirm.

However, anyone in this place would be able to feel a purity close to cleanliness.

Shirone picked up a teaspoon placed on the table and reflected his face in it.

As expected, it was eerily clean for a human-made product. He thought that sacred objects spoken of in the human world might be like this.

'Huh? Come to think of it...'

The most important person, Ikael, was nowhere to be seen. Phoebe had definitely said that she couldn't go outside.

Could she have deceived him?

With a frightening thought, Shirone frantically ran around the room. As expected, no one was there. Every object was clean. It was perfection bordering on terror.

Suddenly, a beautiful melody lingered in his ears. Shirone stopped walking and looked up at the window 5 meters high.

A harp-like clear resonance was beginning from there.

An angel's vibration.

As if bewitched, he approached below the window.

The sunlight coming through the window began to hit a form. When he came to his senses, one woman was sitting on the windowsill looking outside.

It was a beautiful face that no painter could draw.

Shirone confirmed that a sacred light body was floating above her head. It was a bright and warm feeling incomparably different from the fallen angel Ikasa.

As her appearance was revealed, wings of light sprouted. The massively spread wings of light gave Shirone's eyes pleasure.

"Welcome, Shirone."

Shirone was certain.

She was indeed the archangel Ikael.

The first entity of causality. Among them, the symbol of nobility that God cherished most. Such a being was before his eyes.

Ikael landed lightly on the floor.

Her height of over 2 meters was imposing, but such physical characteristics couldn't hide her warm feeling.

It was an indescribable strange feeling. Even saying she was beautiful seemed like criticizing her.

Was this what it looked like when goodness took form? If he had realized truth in Miro's spacetime, then Ikael was goodness.

Ikael looked around for a place to sit with a playful expression that didn't match her mature appearance.

But finding nowhere suitable, she plopped down right there on the spot.

Shirone stared in bewilderment at the sight of Ikael's skirt hem slowly settling down. Then Ikael, sitting with her calves modestly pressed together, patted the floor and called Shirone.

"Come, over here."

Shirone felt an irresistible temptation and snuggled close to her.

It was close enough for their skin to touch.

Perhaps she had suggested the floor because she wanted to see him from the closest distance.

As expected, Ikael brought her face closer. The corners of her mouth gradually rose as she stared intently at Shirone.

When Shirone couldn't hide his embarrassment and lowered his gaze, she finally spoke.

"I wanted to meet you, Shirone."

"Yes? You know me?"

Ikael scratched her eyebrow as if troubled.

Her behavior resembled that of humans. Thinking that even the fallen angel Ikasa had reached the extreme of arrogance, this was quite shocking.

"Knowing and not knowing aren't important. How much you know is important. But as you know, that's not something that can be explained with words, right?"

Shirone gathered courage to examine her face. As they absorbed each other's gazes, a sense of unity sent electricity through his body.

Then he looked up at the sacred light body. This was his first time seeing it from so close.

The sight of light floating above her head was truly a wondrous scene.

Thinking he had been staring blankly for too long, Shirone hastily came to his senses.

"Ah, I'm sorry."

Ikael shook her head as if it was fine.

"The sacred light body is an angel's spirit. Humans enter the Spirit Zone through concentration, but an angel's zone is outside. This is called Over Spirit."

Having heard the explanation, Shirone saw the sacred light body differently. It was like maintaining the four-dimensional detached form at all times.

Literally an angel's spirit.

It was her everything.

Perhaps feeling a bit embarrassed, Ikael added:

"Originally it was brighter than now. But because I committed a wrong, Ra controlled the power of light."

"What sin did you commit?"

Shirone hastily apologized as soon as he asked the question.

"Ah, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked such a thing..."

"It's fine. Although I committed a wrong, I don't regret that action even now."

Shirone found himself feeling relieved for some reason. He didn't know what wrong she had committed, but if the person involved didn't regret it, wouldn't it not be a shameful action?

"Um..."

Shirone hesitated with his words.

He knew it was an absurd request. But once his thoughts had flowed that way, he absolutely couldn't give up.

"Tell me. You can say anything."

"Just once..."

"Yes?"

"Can I touch it just once?"

Ikael blinked, then burst into laughter as if she finally understood.

It was an unexpected request.

There probably wouldn't be a single being throughout heaven who would ask to touch Archangel Ikael's sacred light body.

"Alright. Touch it."

"Um, it's not rude, is it? Just in case..."

Ikael shook her head as if it didn't matter.

Only then did Shirone feel relieved and reach out his hand.

The sacred light body he touched directly was light and energy. A pleasant sensation flowed down the back of his hand.

"It's warm."

"That's because Shirone is a warm person."

"Hehe."

It was the first comfort he had enjoyed since coming to heaven. With her, it seemed like there would be no need to worry about anything in the world.

He wanted to be with her forever.

At that moment, Ikael's hand approached. When startled Shirone backed away, she couldn't hide her flustered expression and made excuses.

"Ah... your hair was disheveled."

"Haha, I ran here eagerly. Actually, many things happened."

Shirone joked while shaking his hair. He was just surprised that their bodies might touch when his heart wasn't prepared.

At that moment, Shirone's eyes opened wide. It felt like being hit in the head with a hammer.

How could he do this without being crazy?

He had completely forgotten the fact that the most important matter remained.

"Oh no! Amy!"

Shirone jumped up.

To think of his friends only now. It showed how impressive the meeting with Ikael had been.

"Please help me! My friends were captured! They said they'd use something called wine of life to make them bear Nephilim."

"Oh my. That's terrible."

"They treat them as heretics or whatever, but they're absolutely not bad kids. No, even if that were the case, I can't accept capturing them like this."

Ikael fell into thought for a moment.

"Shirone, do you like your friends? Enough to risk your life?"

"Yes! Of course!"

Ikael nodded as if that was enough.

"Good. But Shirone, if you want to save your friends, there's a story you must hear."

It didn't seem like there would be any story he needed to hear in this situation.

But since these were the words of Archangel Ikael, he could hardly refuse. Most importantly, the phrase "if you want to rescue your friends" was decisive.

"A story I need to hear? What is it?"

"About heaven. And about a woman named Miro."

Shirone was shocked. He hadn't expected her name to come from Ikael's lips.

Adrias Miro.

When he first came to heaven, he thought she was just one of many Unlockers.

But the more he learned about her, the more he realized she had deep connections to heaven.

He wanted to know what kind of person she really was.

"Do you know Miro?"

"Yes. I've met her. I like her. Of course, she probably dislikes me."

Shirone was shocked. To think that Ikael and Miro had met. Especially the fact that Miro disliked Ikael didn't make sense. From his experience, Ikael was a good angel.

"It won't take long. So could you let me comb Shirone's hair for a moment?"

Ikael's sacred light body spread in the form of a ring.

As intense light rotated along the ring, a comb made of light was born in her hands.

Photon sculpting.

And she had instantly created a tool as delicate as light.

No matter how powerful an angel's mental strength, the properties of light don't change.

It was a tool that could only be created through complex omniscience incomparable to Shining Chain.

Shirone realized that all answers lay in the sacred light body.

Even when he felt an unapproachable aura from Ikasa, it was the moment when the sacred light body had spread in ring form.

"How did you sculpt photons? Is it related to the sacred light body changing?"

"The light ring can quickly process vast amounts of information. This is called a halo. It's like magic circles that humans use. The light ring rotates at the speed of light, assembling countless concepts."

Ikael used magic circles as an example, but having heard it, comparing them seemed rude.

It was literally a method of assembling concepts at the speed of light.

Even if dozens of mages attacked, they couldn't keep up with the speed of one halo.

"Then let's begin. Lie down here, Shirone."

Ikael pointed to her knees. She seemed unable to bear wanting to comb his hair.

Shirone thought there must be some meaning to this too and lay down as she instructed.

Come to think of it, where else could such luxury be found?

Lying on an archangel's knees and looking up at heaven, Ikael lifted the comb and brushed through his hair.

'Huh?'

Shirone felt his consciousness becoming hazy.

As the combing continued, it felt like his consciousness was being extracted in chunks. He didn't want to faint. His friends were captured. If he lost track of time's flow, it would be the end.

'No. I can't...'

Shirone's eyes slowly closed.

Ikael examined the face of Shirone who had fallen asleep, then looked up with sad eyes.

Many thoughts passed through her mind. And through the comb, she seeped into Shirone's spirit.

Like reading a fairy tale to a child, Ikael began her story in a beautiful voice.

"A very long time ago..."

**The Truth of Heaven (1)**

The Great World Hall in Jebul was Kariel's laboratory and an observatory governing the operation of the world.

Because space had been erased with a special function of the Mecha System, as long as the security device was operational, not only entry but even traces could not be found.

Befitting a place with the character for "hall," it was a vast space that could contain Alpheus Magic School.

The overall color scheme was mechanical navy blue, and tens of thousands of electrical signals sparkled on the hemispherical ceiling.

In the northwestern space, a hologram of a globular cluster where stars gathered was slowly expanding.

At the center floated a massive steel sphere over 30 meters in diameter, with two bands rotating along orbital and rotational trajectories.

Amy's group sat in a row near the globular cluster, their wrists bound with steel handcuffs.

Ikasa, who had kidnapped the women, had expected reinstatement as an angel, but only returned to the Second Heaven amid Kariel's silence.

That was the only moment Amy's group had been happy since arriving here.

Conversely, every other situation had been unfavorable.

They hadn't expected that someone as high as an archangel would even put handcuffs on them.
