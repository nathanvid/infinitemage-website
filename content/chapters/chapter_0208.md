The handcuffs bore markings similar to the Hena she had seen at Norse Refuge, and they seemed fixed in space, unmoving. She couldn't even activate magic.

They wouldn't resort to such methods just because they feared mere humans.

Amy thought of a frog trapped in a laboratory.

The reason for binding its limbs before dissection isn't fear of the frog.

The thought made her shiver.

It meant that something naturally worth struggling against was waiting ahead.

Whether sharing the same thought, Tess and Arin also maintained their silence.

As if making no sound would preserve this taut tension forever.

The only consolation was that there was no drone on Tess's wrist.

Upon arriving at Jebul, she had sent out a drone without Ikasa noticing.

It was the resourcefulness of one trained in espionage.

'What's going on? Why can't I see anything?'

But her efforts were useless for now.

The drone could guide Shirone's group to arrive as quickly as possible, but nothing appeared on the retinal screen.

She didn't know that space itself was isolated by Mecha's functions.

Kariel inspected the machinery about 70 meters away from the spherical cluster.

It was a massive pillar reaching to the ceiling, with thousands of panels emitting lights of various colors.

Kariel floated 10 meters high with arms crossed, gazing at the screen.

The screen was filled with complex symbols that Amy's group couldn't understand.

Amy examined Kariel's halo.

Compared to Ikasa's, it was an incomparably massive and vivid ring.

Diagrams and formulas appeared and disappeared like afterimages inside the boundary line, and each time this happened, the machinery's screen changed rapidly as well.

"System inspection complete. Beginning wine of life. Please input the molecular structure of genetic material."

An eerie woman's voice came from the ceiling.

Even Arin couldn't analyze the machine's voice. But attempting telepathy with Kariel would be insane.

After staring at the screen for a while, Kariel flew toward the women.

A low vibration like a contrabass was heard.

He was a beautiful youth. Standing 2 meters 30 centimeters tall, he wore white robes. His sacred light body was so bright it felt like a hole had been punched in space.

Amy mustered her courage and glared at him.

If something had to happen to someone, she intended to be the first. She didn't want to think about Tess or Arin suffering first while they were all captured together.

"Aren't you ashamed to call yourself an archangel? Hurry up and remove these handcuffs!"

"A typical lowly human notion. I have restrained you as an archangel fulfilling my duties."

Arin, who had been staring intently at Kariel, bit her lips.

This was her first time experiencing such a phenomenon.

She could only see vibrating strings. Those vibrations shook in complex patterns to reveal forms, but even those were unclear.

Kariel existed only as probability.

Amy snapped again.

"Duties? What are you planning to do to us?"

"Come to think of it, I forgot my introduction. I am Archangel Kariel. I've been dispatched to occupied territories under Ra's command to perform wine of life procedures. I will now perform wine of life on you as well. It's a glorious mission, so accept it joyfully."

"You've got to be kidding! Tying people up and spouting such nonsense! Remove this first!"

Amy shook her body. With the handcuffs fixed at waist height, all she could do was stomp her feet like a child throwing a tantrum.

Tess, pondering Kariel's words, asked doubtfully.

"Wait. Occupied territories? Are you saying Heaven attacks other worlds?"

Kariel fell into thought. The law was always right. But convincing humans required different conversational methods.

"I merely convey Ra's will. God loves humans and wishes them to exist eternally. Your world will also submit to Ra's will soon."

Tess was seized by a frightening thought.

According to the idea that just occurred to her, Ra was a cosmic tyrant. She had a fleeting thought that Heaven's divine subjects were probably also residents of occupied territories from somewhere.

Amy shouted.

"We saw wine of tales! Is that how you show love for humans? You're no different from a perverted murderer!"

"You don't understand. Humans mistake love for power. Don't think being loved by someone is some great ability. Ra cherishes you simply because you are beings who can be given names."

Amy recalled the registry of life and death. Fairies control divine subjects' lifespans through names.

But isn't giving names something anyone can do? What meaning does bestowing names hold for Ra?

Tess said mockingly.

"So, what do you plan to do with us? Since you've put handcuffs on us, will you show us love by wielding whips?"

"You have an important mission."

"Mission? What mission?"

"To conceive my child."

Amy, Tess, and Arin's faces turned red simultaneously. They felt goosebumps rise to the point their hair stood on end, and irritation surged.

Amy couldn't control her trembling jaw as she screamed.

"You per-perverted freak! Just lay a finger on my body. I won't let you get away with it!"

"A pathetic reaction. Don't worry. I'm merely transmitting angelic information to your bodies."

Tess found those words even more irritating. It was the language of perverts who tried to express perfectly obvious things precisely.

"In other words, you want to have a wild time with us."

Kariel showed displeasure.

"Human expressions are utterly base. Wine of life is an advanced technique that only I among the archangels can perform. Don't compare it to the reproduction of inferior humans."

"Wine of life preparation complete. Information integration rate 100 percent. Shall I replicate?"

Just then, the woman's voice came from the ceiling.

Kariel flew skyward as if words were unnecessary.

"Replicate."

"Replicating genetic material. Required time: 2 minutes 30 seconds."

Kariel's sacred light body expanded into a ring exceeding 20 meters in diameter.

As he brought his index and middle fingers together, a marble-sized light was born at his fingertips.

Though small in size, it was intense enough to illuminate the Great World Hall.

Kariel returned his halo to sacred light body form and came back to the women.

At his fingertips where the light had disappeared, a diamond-shaped glass panel emitting purple light had formed.

"This panel stores information of nearly infinite life. Do you understand? To create humans, information from all life forms that existed before humans is necessary."

"Like we care! Whatever it is, we won't do it!"

Amy shouted. She was already dying of frustration, and the added explanation made her irritation peak.

But Kariel seemed quite proud of his life magic and continued his explanation to an unwilling audience.

"Angelic information is delicate and complex. This is also why women who have given birth have significantly lower success rates for Nephilim births. In that sense, you're quite fortunate. You've gained the glory of directly carrying the descendants of a great angel in your bodies."

"What do you plan to do after... giving birth to Nephilim?"

"Send them to other worlds. In this case, it would be your world."

"To convert humans there and offer them to God?"

At this pointed question, Kariel closed his mouth.

That was exactly it. Make women from occupied territories bear Nephilim, convert the humans there, then guide them to God.

Tess realized that Nephilim were a kind of spy.

Being free from the law meant exactly that.

There would never be any reason to impose one's own nation's laws on combat soldiers infiltrating enemy territory.

Kariel extended the panel floating at his fingertips.

"Don't worry. I'm merely transmitting information, so you won't feel shame."

When the glass panel was placed on the forehead, glass thorns would protrude and embed in the brain like roots.

Through those roots, angelic information would penetrate and create life from the woman's body.

Kariel held the glass panel to each of the three women's foreheads once, as if checking the fit.

All had fair and pretty foreheads that seemed suitable for taking root.

"Hmm, I see. Shall I let you decide? Who will be the first to become the subject of this glorious technique?"

The three women shouted simultaneously.

"I'll go first!"

Not having expected this reaction, the women looked at each other. The fact that they would fight together renewed their courage.

Kariel was satisfied.

To succeed with wine of life, angelic information had to be accurate, but the mother's role was also quite important.

The success rate was roughly 1 in 30, and failure resulted in brain shock and death.

However, the stronger one was mentally and the more excellent the physical conditions, the more the success probability could increase dramatically.

In that regard, all three women were excellent choices.

"Genetic material replication complete."

As the voice came from the ceiling, Kariel raised his hand.

Identical panels formed on both sides of the vertically floating glass panel.

"What good sisters. Since I can't determine superiority, I'll implant them simultaneously."

The three panels that left Kariel's hand approached, swimming through the air.

Amy's group was seized by uncontrollable rage. Now they understood clearly.

Archangel Kariel was the worst kind of pervert.

Rian and Canis arrived at Jebul.

As soon as they crossed the castle walls, the scenery of Jebul they confirmed was the shape of countless discs spreading outward. It looked like an aerial city built on lotus flowers.

As expected from the outside, Jebul's interior was a dimensional maze.

The method of leaping from space to space was too complex to calculate with human thinking.

There were certainly rules, but the two had no time to think.

Relying on the memories Phoebe had given them, they moved according to coordinates alone.

After moving to the same location several times, Canis was able to find the portal to Ingris.

"Let's separate here. Even knowing the way, finding it is another matter. It would be better for at least one person to go ahead."

"Will you be okay? If I can't disable the Mecha System, there's no point in me going first. If there are enemies in Ingris, it might be more effective to deal with them together."

Canis looked back at the portal.

No special device was visible, but according to the memories Phoebe had transmitted, this was definitely Ingris.

Since they hadn't encountered anyone so far, the probability of enemies being in Ingris was slim.

But if there were any, the enemy would be at least on the level of Mara.

From that perspective, moving together as Rian suggested might be better.

But Canis didn't change his mind.

He didn't know how long it would take to disable the Mecha System. Wasting manpower under any circumstances was never a good method.

"Nothing's certain anyway. There's no guarantee it'll be easier with two people. Let's each do what we can. That's the best option right now."

Rian was convinced. After adjusting the Signa and Exd he received from Rena, he headed east of Jebul.

Canis took a deep breath and stepped onto the platform.

He didn't need to do anything special. As soon as he placed both feet on the coordinates, cracks opened in the floor and light exploded with a bang.

In the time it took to close and open his eyes once, the scenery had changed.

Angel Archive Ingris.

Unlike the warm feeling contained in the word "archive," it was a mechanical landscape with no trace of humanity.

Roads extended in a cross shape from the central control device, and the walls were covered with vertically erected rectangular panels.

Harvest revealed itself as if displeased.

To him who felt the world through vibrations, Ingris was a space completely filled with vibrations without any margin.

Canis looked around to see if there were enemies.

He would probably have to check all the corners, but so far no noticeable presence was visible.
