"It seems no one's here."

"That's actually better. Whether they're Mara or angels, honestly I don't have the confidence to fight them."

Canis tilted his head. He hadn't expected such weak words from Harvest, who had inherited Arcane's memories.

"You're different from Master."

"Personality isn't determined by memories alone. I was designed to protect you. To speak coldly, without Ikael's help, I won't be able to complete the mission."

That was the reality. Shirone held the key to returning to their original world.

Though Canis felt his pride wounded at not being able to be the protagonist, he wasn't foolish enough to damage their teamwork.

"Still, if we don't disable the Mecha System, we won't have any opportunities at all. Should we take a look around first?"

Canis moved forward while surveying their surroundings. Suddenly sensing something strange, he approached a wall.

Panels attached at regular intervals looked remarkably similar to books shelved in a library.

When he touched a panel with his hand, he felt a faint vibration.

The moment he pressed gently, there was a clicking sound.

Fearing it might trigger an alarm, he hastily stepped back. With a humming sound, the panel popped out.

Canis grabbed the panel and pulled it out completely. A transparent rectangular electronic board like glass was connected to the panel.

He tried holding it vertically, then laying it horizontally.

The moment he touched the panel side with his thumb, letters made of light appeared on the glass plate.

'I see. This is the angels' library.'

Canis realized this as he recalled the enormous number of panels embedded in Ingris.

Ingris was a space filled with knowledge.

When he touched the blinking arrow on the panel, the page turned. As he turned pages in amazement, the text continued endlessly.

It was an information system of incomparably higher density than books.

Since he couldn't read the characters, his gaze naturally went to the numbers written below the glass plate.

The first thing that came to mind was the memo left by his master.

Ingris

113-325-4739-49359-234

This was all that Arcane had recorded. It was probably a serial number that could identify the panel's location.

Canis was certain his master had been to Ingris before. And here he must have realized something and discovered the enhancement method for dark magic.

Canis examined the characters on the glass plate. He couldn't even guess how they should be pronounced.

"Harvest, do you know what kind of writing this is?"

"No. It's a language I've never seen before either. We'd probably need Arin."

At that moment, the letters began to collapse, and then the language they used was inscribed on the glass plate.

"Automatic language conversion? That's impossible."

Ingris wasn't a space created for Canis.

Therefore, it could be assumed that the panels contained records of every kind of language that existed in the world.

It was a terrifying rate of information accumulation.

Canis looked again at the characters inscribed on the glass plate. What was written on the page was information about dreams. He began reading aloud as he skimmed through it.

"...Drimo is a world that can be entered through dreams. The method is to find the dream person Rubor in the dream, but since he's in a place removed from events, concentration is needed to discover him. Usually he's cooking in some house or caring for children. Only Rubor emits color, so distinguishing him isn't too difficult."

He turned to the next page.

"When you meet him, hand over money and say you've come looking for work. Then he'll arrange several jobs you can do in the dream, but if you refuse three times, he'll send you to Drimo. If you find a job you like, you can enjoy the dream as long as you want, but if you wake up, it won't remain in your memory."

Canis pursed his lips and looked back at Harvest.

When Harvest shrugged, he turned his head back to the panel and continued reading the content.

"Since time doesn't exist in Drimo's world, there are numerous objects that ignore the law of causality. To bring objects to reality, five conditions must be met. First, help the object's owner and receive that object as payment. Second, go to the government office and report the theft of the object..."

"You can't do that. It's forbidden by law."

Canis's voice cut off abruptly.

He slowly turned his head to see a petite woman standing at the first corner of Ingris.

Her skin was light purple and her eyes were sharply slanted. She had abundant light green curly hair, and above her head floated a triangle emitting red light.

She was a minor Mara.

Canis and Harvest, with their nerves on edge, stared at her without moving a muscle.

"Please, could you slowly put that back where it belongs? Even if you were an archangel, browsing Ingris without the manager's permission is prohibited."

Without taking his eyes off her, Canis put the panel back in its original place.

As if being pulled in, the panel went in and became indistinguishable from the other panels.

"Sorry about that. This is my first time here."

Deciding to buy time to think, Canis apologized first.

"I figured as much. A divine subject wouldn't break the law. Anyway, it's been a while since heretics came in."

Canis realized that her mouth movements matched her pronunciation.

She wasn't speaking through telepathy.

"How do you know our language?"

"Hehe, I'm a language collector. Besides, what kind of Ingris manager would I be if I couldn't communicate? Actually, by count, there have been quite a few. People who use exactly the same language as you."

The first person who came to mind was Arcane. Then he thought of the Unlocker group that the Kergo chief had reportedly sent.

"Do you know someone named Kadum?"

The manager's face lit up as she exclaimed.

"Aha! So that was you? Of course I know. In your time, heretics came 200 years ago. They asked me to extend someone named Kadum's lifespan by 300 years."

Hearing her words, Canis was certain.

Ingris was definitely a place that controlled human lifespans.

But how?

Just having an unimaginable degree of information accumulation couldn't explain such a phenomenon.

"Is that possible? How do you change a person's lifespan?"

"Haa, I really get this question a lot. I don't know how people find this place without knowing."

The manager walked around with her hands behind her back like a teacher. Her eyes were full of affection as she looked at the panels.

"How can lifespans be changed, you ask? It's because this place is connected to the Akashic Records."

Canis knew about the Akashic Records too. It was a term he'd often encountered while studying mythology.

A supernatural information aggregate said to contain all records of the universe.

The fact that the same term was used in Heaven meant that the mythological content was true.

But it was an incomprehensible theory.

"Impossible. What you're saying is false."

"Oh? Why?"

"Because a record containing everything in the world can't exist in the first place. How would you verify that it's everything? It means there must be some exaggeration."

"Hmm, humans are definitely human. Well, with your level of thinking, that makes sense too."

Canis felt a bit irritated.

"So you're saying it's not true?"

"The Akashic Records aren't such a grand and amazing thing. This world is just the Akashic Records."

"Explain it so I can understand."

The manager's eyes lit up as if a good idea had occurred to her.

"Since you're human too, I'll borrow the Mecha's explanation. Multiply 2 by 3, then add 1. What do you get?"

"Obviously 7."

"Right. That's exactly how humans think. Humans need to find the problem to get the answer. They're beings who need to know the equation to get the answer."

"So what? Are you saying you're different?"

"We are different. Then let me pose a problem Heaven's way. I just got the answer 7. Guess what equation I went through to reach 7."

Canis closed his mouth. He couldn't know. There were infinitely many ways to reach 7.

"Now do you see? The Akashic Records are just the correct answer. This time, shall I borrow the Norse's words? Using any expression you like, could you perfectly explain Ingris?"

Language cannot completely convey its original meaning. But now Canis understood what the Akashic Records were.

"Ingris."

The manager nodded satisfyingly.

"Exactly. Ingris is Ingris. Ingris existed before you came. But to you, this place was something that existed nowhere. Why would that be?"

"Because I didn't know... the name."

This was a serious situation. Canis realized why Ra needed names to control lifespans.

Names. That was everything.

"Now we're finally communicating. The world doesn't exist for stones or wind. It's complete nothingness. Even though it actually exists like this. Because they lack the ability to assign meaning. When the name 'universe' was given to the universe, only then did the universe come into being."

Heaven doesn't try to find the correct answer.

Because there is no correct answer, or it's the whole. Instead, they were distorting truth by changing the equations that reach the correct answer.

Whether the correct answer of 7 changed to 8 or 9 didn't matter.

Whatever answer came out, it would be everything in the world, and therefore would be perfect.

"Humans always wander around looking for the one truth, like fools. Where is there a unique truth? However the world changes, that's everything."

The manager pointed to the panels.

"Ingris is connected to the Akashic Records using the Mecha System. It changes truth by twisting equations. This is called hacking, and something like human lifespans can be fixed quickly."

Canis felt a sense of crisis. The technology to destroy truth with Mecha's abilities was at a level that humanity could never reach unless their paradigm changed revolutionarily.

The manager clicked her fingers to get attention.

"Enough explanation. If you came to trade, let's go over there. We can change lifespans at the central control device."

The manager sent a secretive glance as she pointed to the mechanical device standing at the center of the crossroads.

Canis recalled the appearance of black market dealers he'd seen in Radum in the past. Then suddenly this situation felt surreal.

Mara belonged to Heaven and he was a heretic. Why wasn't she harming him?

"You want to make a deal? You must know what the situation outside is like."

"Huh? The situation outside? Is something happening in Heaven?"

"Don't tell me you don't know?"

"Of course I don't know. I'm the manager of Ingris, no less. Just processing the information here is overwhelming. I haven't been outside for tens of thousands of years."

Canis intuited that her words were probably true. Except for the part where she said she was too busy to pay attention.

She was isolated here.

In his thinking, this had to be the case.

If the manager with authority to modify the Akashic Records gained access to worldly information, there was no telling what catastrophic events might occur.

'No wonder I thought it was strange that a mere minor Mara was managing this place. Well, it's actually better for me?'

In any case, conflict with the manager was unavoidable. Unless they just made a deal and left, she wouldn't just watch them disable Jebul's security system.

"What kind of deal are you talking about?"

"Oh, come on. Why act like you don't know? Lifespans, lifespans. I can extend anyone's lifespan."

"What's the price I have to pay?"

The manager slightly separated her thumb and index finger while winking.

"Very cheap. Just one word."

"A word? You want me to pay with a word?"

"As I mentioned before, I'm a Mara who collects languages. Thanks to that, I'm smart. That's why I'm also the Ingris manager. Any word is fine. You just need to sell me one word you know."

"If I sell a word, I'll no longer know that word, right?"

"That's right. You'll never be able to know that word for the rest of your life. It gets erased from the Akashic Records. But it doesn't matter, does it? It's not like anything changes just because you're missing one word."

As the manager said, the world was full of words that people knew but didn't use.

If curse words were acceptable, what would change if he didn't use one of those?

But the price seemed too cheap, which made him anxious instead.
