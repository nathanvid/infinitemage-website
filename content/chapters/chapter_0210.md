"I don't understand. Why make such a contract? I know that the Ingris administrator can't interfere in Heaven's affairs. But you also follow the laws. Selling lifespan to heretics isn't exactly a normal duty."

The administrator blinked vacantly.

"You're quite direct. Usually people pretend not to know about these things even when they do. Anyway, fine. I was given the position of Ingris librarian because I have the ability to acquire concepts. For tens of thousands of years. What do you think that means? That I can't do anything here. So I need words. To escape from this place."

It was an absurd story. But theoretically, it wasn't impossible.

A Mara's lifespan would be close to eternal. No one knew how much remained, but if she kept collecting words, she would eventually reach it.

"You're trying to become the Akashic Records yourself."

"Hoho! Exactly! While controlling information here, I realized it. I could become a god too. But one thing was missing! The information about how to get out of here was removed. I need to fill that gap! That's why heretics are my main customers. If I can just get out of here, I'll become greater than Ra!"

Harvest spoke through the mental channel.

*—Canis, this woman is dangerous.*

Canis thought she was somewhat unhinged too.

Eventually she would gather enough words to complete the Akashic Records, but no one knew when that would be.

Of course, he understood her feelings.

If he had been trapped in a library for tens of thousands of years, he would have gone mad too.

Madness gradually seeped into the administrator's eyes.

"Are you going to do it or not? You've been stalling this whole time. Don't tell me you have some other agenda?"

A bluish aura surrounded the Mara's body. Powerful hostility was transmitted.

If he didn't make the deal, it would be an immediate battle. But could he win? If he died here, his friends' efforts would be in vain.

*—Canis, it's dangerous. You need to be careful.*

Canis now understood the risk too.

The offer to extend one's lifespan by selling just one word was tempting to any human.

Honestly, when he first received the proposal, the first thing that came to mind was himself and Arin.

If their lifespan extended to 300 years, what more could they want in the world?

But they hadn't done it.

The Unlockers who came here 200 years ago extended Kadum's lifespan as contracted and returned to their original world.

The reason was simple.

Because they had to reveal their names.

That was also why Canis hadn't wagered his lifespan.

Would it really be safe to reveal his name to a Mara who could control all information?

If she learned the word "Canis," he couldn't imagine what demands the half-mad Mara might make.

*—I know. But I can't stall forever. I need to disable the Mecha System too.*

As Canis remained silent, the administrator's face contorted like a monster's.

She was on the verge of going berserk.

'Even a minor Mara would be disadvantageous in a direct confrontation. I have no choice but to buy time by making a contract.'

It didn't seem like anything serious would happen from giving up one word.

But those who came 200 years ago had definitely said it wasn't a profitable business.

Considering that historians' perspectives inevitably influenced records, it meant they had suffered tremendous losses.

'Anyway, they made contracts. That much is certain. But what exactly happens when you sell a word?'

Canis tried to imagine the situation from 200 years ago. Nothing came to mind.

Then one thought flashed through his mind. If his master had also come to Ingris, what choice would he have made?

'That's it! That was it!'

Canis gave his instructions.

*—I'll try to buy time. You look for the panel with the serial number written in the memo. There should be something written on it.*

*—What are you planning? Even if it's a method to enhance dark magic, it's not something we can do right now.*

*—No. Master would have known there was an administrator in Ingris. Yet he only left the serial number, so what we're looking for might not be what we thought.*

*—I see. Got it. But the number is complex, so it'll take time to find.*

Harvest disappeared into Canis's shadow, absorbed into the darkness and slipped away elsewhere.

"Fine, I'll make the deal."

When Canis spoke as if giving up, the administrator's face instantly brightened.

"Good thinking! So who? Should I extend your lifespan?"

"No. It's Kadum again this time."

"Oh, really? I don't know who that person is, but he's quite fortunate."

"But... this time, instead of extending it, restore it to its original state. Ingris should be able to do that, right?"

The administrator blinked incredulously.

While countless people had asked to extend their lifespans, this was the first time someone asked to restore it.

A wicked smile spread across her lips.

"Interesting. Something must have happened?"

Canis responded with the same smile.

Kadum, the chief of Kergo, was starving his tribespeople to death for his own immortality. Canis, who knew the pain of hunger well, didn't like him.

He was a human who had lived 300 extra years on money extorted from his tribespeople.

He should consider himself lucky that instead of being killed outright, he was only being restored to his original lifespan.

"Good, good. I like this kind of thing."

The administrator frantically tapped the central control device.

Canis pretended to show interest while watching what she was doing. He was ignorant about machines, but observing now might help later.

"There, done. I've restored his lifespan to its original state. Of course, there are some differences depending on the person. They accept time differently. Still, this person probably won't live much longer. Taking away 300 years puts him almost at his biological limit."

"I don't care. He's lived long enough."

"Hohoho! He has lived quite long for a human. Now then..."

Canis jumped back in alarm. The administrator's eyes had changed without him noticing.

He had somewhat expected it, but seeing her mental state flip back and forth like that gave him chills. He could only hope Harvest would move a little faster.

"Contract complete! Now shall I take that word?"

"Ugh!"

Canis grimaced as he felt a headache. He didn't know what kind of ability it was, but it was irregular.

The problem was that it was a contract, not just compensation.

An irregular formula bound by mutual contract couldn't be canceled even if it didn't violate equivalent exchange.

"Damn! Wasn't I supposed to choose the word?"

"Hehe! Of course you are! I'm just testing the waters. Hmm? Not bad. Let me see what words you have. Ah, this is good. This one too! I like them all so much I'm going crazy!"

Watching the administrator scream with an ecstatic expression, Canis corrected his misconception.

She wasn't just slightly unhinged. It was similar to the obsessive behavior seen in nerds crazed about numbers.

*—Harvest, are you still far?*

*—Wait! I've found up to the second item.*

If it was the second serial number, there was still a long way to go.

Canis thought about buying time with magic.

But the magic wouldn't activate. Whenever he thought of a concept, she would immediately delete it.

'Damn. So that's her ability.'

The administrator's irregular formula "Editorial Department in the Head" could freely edit the thoughts of contracted targets.

The ability the administrator was casting on Canis was called "suggestion," editing his thoughts and making proposals.

He could regain his original thoughts by exercising his right of refusal, but being unable to think logically for a short time was fatal in combat.

"How is it? Overwhelming, right? Eyes. Anger. Comrade. Focus. What else shall I edit?"

"Damn it!"

Canis gritted his teeth to avoid losing his thoughts. Every time a word slipped away, the linguistic structure associated with it collapsed, making one side of his head feel completely empty.

"Hehehehe! Now you understand? How important one word is? 200 years ago, that human sold me the word 'mosquito'! Said he hated them or something! Do you know what happened to him?"

*—Harvest!*

*—Almost found it! It's the last item!*

Canis couldn't collect himself.

Even when he exercised his right of refusal, she deliberately scrambled everything, nearly making him lose consciousness.

Apparently satisfied enough, the administrator grabbed Canis by the throat and lifted him up.

Despite looking frail, a minor Mara's physical strength exceeded Tabu's.

"That human had nightmares about mosquitoes for days and went crazy. Can you imagine? They appear in dreams, but he doesn't know what they are. No human could endure it without going insane. Hehehehe!"

Canis realized how much history could be distorted.

Not a profitable business? They had lost their comrade. The value of one word was ultimately a life.

"You... fraud."

"Oh my? Says the one who had his own scheme."

The administrator turned her head while still gripping Canis's throat.

All the panels where Harvest had swept through were pulled out. He had probably searched through the panels to find words she didn't know and then tried to sell them.

"Hehe, quite clever. But that's impossible. The words you can sell must have meaning assigned to them. I explained that earlier. No learning ability, do you?"

Canis's face turned deathly pale. Blood wasn't reaching his brain.

"Come on, why don't you just give it up and relax? Otherwise, you'll die here."

*—Ha, Harvest...*

*—Found it! Canis!*

Harvest felt the records written on the glass plate with his hands.

Since he perceived the world through vibrations, the sentences written on the plate seeped through the mental channel.

Canis's half-rolled eyes returned to their proper position.

"Fine, I'll give you the word."

"Hehe, good choice. Now, what word will it be?"

'Suggestion' was certainly a powerful ability. But the true terror lay in 'coercion.'

Activated by contract, it permanently stole whatever word the opponent offered, with consequences directly tied to life.

The administrator waited for Canis's answer with eyes drunk on madness.

A situation where one had to offer a word knowing it would drive them insane.

For her, there could be no more thrilling moment.

"Eu..."

The administrator's brow furrowed slightly. She didn't particularly like words starting with "eu."

"Eu. Re. Ka."

Canis immediately fell to the floor. As he gasped for breath while clutching his throat and raised his head, the administrator was trembling with a deathly pale face.

"You... how do you know my name..."

What was recorded on the panel with the serial number Arcane had left had nothing to do with dark magic.

Chronicles of Mara.

Among them, records related to Eureka, the administrator of Ingris.

Eureka hadn't been mad from the beginning.

Rather, she had been a decent Mara who entered intellectuals' minds to edit their thoughts and help with inspiration.

Probably tens of thousands of years of solitude had changed her to this state.

"No, no! It can't end like this!"

Canis had known Eureka and then forgotten her.

Ultimately, the current situation meant that Eureka, who shouldn't exist, was existing, so according to the law of causality, she had no choice but to be annihilated.

"No! Just a little more and I could have done it! I could have become a god! Call me! Tell me who I am!"

"I'm sorry, but..."

Canis said with a faint smile.

"I don't know who you are."

Shock filled Eureka's eyes. Her pupils rolled back and a scream filled with anguish raced along Ingris's walls.

As Eureka vanished and the irregular formula was broken, Canis could regain his concepts.

"Phew, I really can't keep doing this."

Canis collapsed. If Harvest had found the information even a little later, he would have departed for the next world.

Oh wait, wasn't this already the next world?

"Canis, are you okay?"

"Yeah, more or less. My mental strength should recover if I rest a bit."

Ingris felt desolate without its master.

Canis looked at where Eureka had disappeared. Solitude was a painful word for him too.

Harvest spoke as if representing those feelings.

"She must have been lonely. Rotting in a place like this for tens of thousands of years."

"They said Mara are only initialized. In her next life, she should be able to live a better life than now."

After a silence like a moment of mourning, Harvest spoke.

"But Canis, there's one fact I need to tell you. The moment I encountered the word Eureka, Arcane's memories partially revived. It seems that was some kind of keyword."

Canis, realizing something, suddenly stood up.
