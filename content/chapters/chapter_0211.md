"A double lock mechanism!"

"That's right. What a meticulous guy. From now on, I'll show you Arcane's memories, so check for yourself."

Harvest's memories flowed in. It seemed Arcane had come to heaven with his companions.

During that time, he entered Ingris alone.

Naturally, Eureka proposed a contract.

Arcane accepted the proposal in exchange for free access to Ingris. Even then, she was insane, so as soon as the contract was established, she began attacking Arcane.

'Master...'

Unlike Canis, who couldn't even lift a finger in battle, Arcane engaged in close combat with Eureka without being pushed back at all.

'Impossible. How can he cast magic when his words are being edited?'

Canis delved deeper into his memories.

The solution was ingenious enough to be called typical of Arcane. He had completely erased his memory using Abyss-type magic.

When thoughts disappear, there are no concepts that can be sold.

But that wasn't the end. Arcane began restoring the morphemes of language one by one.

He tried to find Mara's name by comparing all possible language combinations using morphemes against the editor's reactions.

At some point, as near-infinite words repeated assembly and disassembly, Eureka suddenly screamed.

Turning pale, she flew away to a place where Arcane wasn't, without looking back.

The position where Arcane's language combination roulette stopped was Eureka.

"...Is this even possible? He combined tens of thousands of languages in that brief moment."

"There's no limit to what happens in thought. Well, even so, he probably couldn't write novels. It's mathematical. He laid out morphemes, created an algorithm, and then spun it like a roulette. His brain must have been sharp when he was young. Anyway, just look at how he created meâ€”he's a genius. If only he hadn't insisted on dark magic, he wouldn't have remained a mere 3rd-class magician."

Canis felt proud to be Arcane's disciple.

Moreover, wasn't his ability to defeat Eureka also derived from the memo his master had left behind?

Eureka probably hid until Arcane left. During that time, Arcane must have found Eureka's information and recorded her serial number.

Arcane's final memory entered Canis's mind. Learning the true reason for the double lock mechanism sent chills through him.

Arcane was conveying the location to his disciple through memory, not records.

Canis walked to the spot where Arcane had last stood. Following his master's exact movements, he reached out toward the panel.

'Thank you, Master.'

Of course, Arcane at that time wouldn't have known he would take Canis as his disciple. But his message to the junior who would arrive here was clear.

Magician, become an eternal boy.

Taking out the panel Arcane had designated and converting the language, Canis confirmed the sentence that appeared on the glass plate.

The Book of Light and Darkness.

Canis quickly skimmed through the pages. Among them, one phrase touched his heart, and he stared at it intently.

Harvest patted his shoulder and said, "You've achieved your purpose in coming to heaven."

"No. I can't say that until I safely return. I have to save Arin."

"That's right. I wonder if they're okay over there? Quite a bit of time has been delayed."

Canis handed the panel to Harvest and went to the central control device.

"It's just the right time for Rian to arrive. Copy the records for me. I'll try to disable the Mecha System."

Harvest placed his palm on the glass plate and imprinted all the text at once. It was a method of memorizing all the vibration patterns while turning pages.

Arriving at the central control device, Canis couldn't touch anything. Cold sweat ran down his forehead.

He understood the principle from secretly watching Eureka touch the screen, but it was impossible to handle equipment he'd never seen before like an expert.

"Damn, why is this so complicated?"

Canis randomly pressed buttons. What's the worst mistake he could make besides breaking it?

At some point, a complete map of Jebul appeared.

When he touched the Great World Hall, the screen enlarged and numerous items appeared in succession.

Entering the security system, he spotted a setting that blocked the Mecha System.

Canis chose to disable it without hesitation.

Several areas that had appeared as dotted lines on the map were revealed as solid lines.

"Canis, I've stored all the records. Since I only memorized them as patterns, I'll need to convert them to language when I have time."

"Good. I found something too. Looking at the map, every area in Jebul has portals installed that lead to Ingris. In other words, this place is the heart of Jebul. So if we take the portals in reverse, we should be able to exit through the portal closest to the Great World Hall."

Canis and Harvest ran to the end of Ingris.

It was fortunate that things worked out well, but that didn't mean the situation had improved.

Arin was still there.

They could only hope Rian wouldn't be late.

Ikael's memories poured into Shirone's unconscious mind in chunks. The temporal order was jumbled, but it was faster than the speed of thought, so he couldn't feel any contradiction.

Shirone was shocked to see the form of Ra that Ikael conveyed. It was the pinnacle of grotesqueness. However, the intellectual level it contained transcended humans of the present world.

"Even if parts change, the whole remains perfect."

Ra was the first intelligence to realize the existence of the universe.

"The universe is something God abandoned and left behind. Doesn't anyone know this exists! But I gave it meaning. Therefore, this universe is mine."

The first existence Ra gave meaning to was angels.

The first entities of causality became second entities, which were further subdivided into giants and fairies. They each acted according to laws and spread Ra's will.

Ikael took Shirone to some world. Countless creatures lived there, but no being existed that could give meaning.

A giant reaching 2 kilometers in height arrived through a dimensional gate. When the giant stood up, his face pierced through the clouds and mountain ranges prostrated below his waist.

Ikael also informed him about the giant.

The wine of tales consisted of 10 stages total, and only giants who surpassed the 6th stage could depart for new worlds.

The giant let out a roar. His body gradually began to collapse, and blood and flesh fell like rain.

After a long time passed again... humans began appearing one by one where the giant had fallen.

When humans who had created society were developing civilization, an angel came and blessed a girl's body with a child. Someday the child would become a Nephilim and guide people to heaven.

As time passed, changes began occurring in human society.

Humans equipped with the ability to give meaning grew rapidly and eventually became intoxicated with their own power, beginning to distance themselves from God.

Heaven's army descended and punished them.

The battle was one-sided. Heaven's power was mighty, and angels and Mara destroyed numerous civilizations.

Nevertheless, humans tenaciously prospered and repeated the same mistakes.

Then one day, a group denying God appeared on an island called Galiant in the south.

Seraph Ikael personally stepped forward. She, who could activate the power of all things, amplified the volcanic activity of Galiant by more than 20,000 times, causing a volcanic eruption.

Time flowed rapidly, revealing a world similar to the era Shirone lived in.

Humans still enjoyed prosperity.

Judging that impiety had reached its peak, Anke Ra finally decided to destroy humanity.

The final war. The end of the world.

Shirone watched heaven's situation at that time.

A portal dozens of meters high was open, and in front of it, heaven's army consisting of giants, fairies, and divine subjects was preparing for departure.

Angel vibrations echoed in the sky, while the roars of armored Mara resounded on the ground.

'No! Absolutely not!'

Shirone screamed, forgetting that the scene unfolding before his eyes was from the past. They absolutely couldn't win. If heaven's army entered, that would be the end of the world.

When the sortie order was given, an enormous army led by angels poured into the portal.

Shirone's mind also followed them inside the portal. Passing through a colorful tunnel, he could see the exit.

His stomach churned with tension. This was a past memory.

But then, how exactly did humans manage to stop heaven's army?

'Such wars weren't even recorded in history.'

When the destination came into view, the Mara burned with fighting spirit and screamed. Shirone flew ahead of them. And the moment he reached the end of the portal, he froze.

What spread before his eyes wasn't the original world.

A pale space with nothing in it. And there, a woman had positioned herself standing.

It was Adrias Miro.

"Guffin, I will never forgive you."

Miro was crying. She, who faced the great army alone, extended her fist and cast magic.

Then something amazing happened. As if blocked by an invisible barrier, the leading Mara began to stop.

The angels looked at Miro with difficulty. Meanwhile, the Mara pounded the barrier and screamed hideously.

"You impure thing! You will pay the price for betraying Ra!"

"Remember this clearly, Miro! The end has only been postponed! When that time comes, we'll kill you first!"

Shirone learned the whole truth.

She had created another spacetime between the hole connecting heaven and the human world, cutting off the connection.

That was... Miro's spacetime.

From the group of angels, a man with a massive build flew to the end of the portal.

It was Archangel Uriel.

"How long do you think you can hold out doing this? There's no way to avoid the final war. We will definitely return. Use your remaining time preciously."

Miro bit her lips until they bled. As the new spacetime filled in, the distance between them grew.

Uriel glared fiercely at Miro before turning around. Then the angels also began returning to heaven one by one.

But the Mara remained until the end, hurling curses. They cried out desperately until Miro's figure, gradually growing distant, could no longer be seen.

Shirone also grew distant with heaven's army. But he couldn't take his eyes off Miro.

He understood why Great Magician Arcane had tried not to tell the world, even going so far as to erase his memories.

One day, there had been a moment when humanity was about to be destroyed.

And Miro was still staying in her own space, postponing the world's end.

**Angel's Magic Formula (1)**

Shirone opened his eyes.

The first thing he felt was refreshment. It was as if he had woken up from a long sleep.

How long had he been sleeping?

When his thoughts reached that point, Shirone sat up and shouted, "No! My friends...!"

Ikael reassured Shirone.

"Don't worry. The time you were asleep didn't even take 5 minutes."

"But why does my body...?"

"Your mind cleared as my light penetrated. I can activate everything."

As she said, his mental strength, which had been exhausted from consecutive battles from Igirin to Tabu, was completely restored.

"Ah, thank you. I didn't even know..."

"It's fine. By the way, how do you feel about learning heaven's secrets?"

Shirone traced through the memories Ikael had conveyed. Though it felt hazy like a dream, it definitely wasn't a dream.

He had learned tremendous facts. Especially the fact that Miro had done such a thing was shocking.

"The ability to connect dimensions is the exclusive domain of angels. But we've been passing angel abilities to humans for a long time."

"That's the Nephilim."

"That's right. Nephilim play the role of guiding humans to God. But some Nephilim do the opposite. Such civilizations usually deviate from God's will and build independent civilizations. Like the world Shirone lived in."

Shirone understood why ancient magic records were different. At some point, humans had deviated from God's will, and the magic they had independently developed was the Spirit Zone.
