"You said Guffin. That's the same Guffin who created Guffin's Gate, right? Why did Miro call out that person's name at the last moment?"

Ikael blinked with a surprised expression.

It was unexpected that Shirone had heard that voice. But soon she continued her explanation in a calm tone.

"Guffin was the first gatekeeper who protected your world from Heaven's army. Miro is, so to speak... Guffin's successor."

"What? You mean Miro wasn't the first?"

"The situations the two faced were different, but essentially, yes. Maclean Guffin—that person would be one of the most outstanding humans in your world. No, he surpasses even the Nephilim. That's probably why he separated humans from God."

"Then where is that person now?"

Ikael shook her head.

"He departed to a place I cannot look down upon, leaving behind Miro as his successor."

"But that means..."

"Yes. She must eternally serve as a barrier in a place where time doesn't flow. Otherwise, Shirone's world will face destruction."

Shirone's lips trembled. Miro's face from their last meeting came vividly to mind.

What must she have felt, having to face indefinite solitude, isolated from the world?

At that moment, a terrifying thought occurred to him.

The conversations he'd had with the headmaster came to mind one by one.

At the time, Alpheas's face had looked sad. No, sometimes he'd even made frightening expressions like an angry person.

What if Miro hadn't chosen that path herself?

What if she'd been isolated by someone's coercion?

Having thought that far, Shirone felt goosebumps.

This couldn't even be called a crime. It was a decision that had thrown one human into eternal hell.

"Just how long must Miro...?"

"Even now, Heaven's army is making full preparations for the final war. Perhaps it won't take too long. The Metagate that Shirone's party brought has coordinates recorded in it."

Shirone's mind went blank.

Miro had used Scale magic to block Heaven's gate. But the Metagate was tantamount to opening a new gate to Heaven.

"No way... that can't be..."

"No. It's possible. With just the Metagate, Heaven's technology can bypass Miro's spacetime and enter."

Shirone felt his heart sink.

This wasn't a matter of their life and death. It was the destruction of all humanity.

He couldn't believe it was true. What on earth had they done?

"That's also why I want to help. Shirone's friends are captured in the Great World Hall. Kariel will implant Nephilim information into the girls' bodies."

"Why? You said they're preparing for the final war! What do the Nephilim have to do with this situation?"

"Because the situation has changed. Miro isn't a Nephilim. Yet she opened Immortal Function on her own. Such cases are extremely rare, but they're happening quite frequently in Shirone's world."

That was also why confusion had come when he heard about Nephilim at Norse Refuge. There were too many Unlockers to be called descendants of angels.

"It means Shirone's world has grown distant from Ra's will. Guffin bought time so humans could understand the essence of the world. And now that will has passed to Miro. Of course, the time she defended is pitiful compared to Guffin's. But considering the speed of growth, it's at a level that can't be overlooked."

Shirone agreed with those words too.

The pace of magical development was definitely accelerating. There were even analyses that the achievements of the past 100 years were inferior to those of the recent 10 years.

"This time, humans won't be easily defeated either."

"That's right. Though they're few, the rulers of the human world probably know of Heaven's existence too. They're likely preparing in some way. Right now, even one more Nephilim is needed."

Shirone shuddered. To destroy humans by injecting angel information into human bodies.

The thought that Amy would give birth to someone for such a reason was unbearable.

"Why have you been just watching? As an archangel, you could ask them to release her."

Ikael looked at Shirone with sad eyes.

"Ah..."

That was it. Why does Miro hate Ikael? Because she's the angel who commands Heaven's army. Ikael had also once been a seraph who brought punishment to humans.

"Yes, I am an angel. If the final war occurs... I too will have no choice but to fight humans."

Shirone felt all strength drain from his body.

Was this how it would end? Having to watch his friends suffer without being able to get help from anyone in Heaven?

"If it had been... before I met Guffin."

Ikael smiled with her eyes and stuck out her tongue playfully.

"Don't worry, Shirone. I want to help you. Unlike angels, humans contain infinite possibilities. I think the final war must never happen."

Shirone wore a blank expression before realizing the weight contained in her words.

If an archangel who had risen to the rank of seraph would side with humans, there was hope even if the final war occurred.

She had said before meeting Guffin. He couldn't ask what sin Ikael had committed, but he could guess it was connected to that person.

"But you mustn't be relieved. I'm in a body with sealed powers. Moreover, I can't even leave this room, so even if I help Shirone, I can't provide direct assistance."

"But... with my power, I can't defeat an angel."

"That's right. Angels are strong. Moreover, if it's Kariel, he's a powerful archangel that I couldn't carelessly face even before I lost my power."

"Then what do we do now?"

She wouldn't have brought this up just to discourage him. Shirone waited for a solution to come from her while hoping for a thread of hope.

"There is one method. The possibility of saving your friends will increase somewhat."

"Really? What is it?"

"The angel's magic circle. You would master it, Shirone."

"So... you mean the halo?"

"That's right. Angels activate abilities by accumulating information in their halos. If Shirone learns this, you could create one opportunity at a crucial moment."

Shirone recalled the events at Shamain. The sense of intimidation he'd felt when Ikasa deployed her halo still remained in his body.

But she was telling him to master that?

He didn't think it was possible. Humans don't have Over Spirit.

Without a sacred light body, there's no space to inscribe information—how could he create a magic circle?

"Of course, it won't be easy. For Shirone to use an angel's magic circle, you must overcome at least three difficulties."

Ikael said while holding up three fingers.

"First is creating a sacred light body. I know that while a human's mind exists within the body, it can be extracted through special methods. Can you do it?"

Shirone nodded. The concept Ikael spoke of was the separation form of the Four-Direction Style.

Certainly, with the separation form, it seemed possible to somewhat mimic an angel's Over Spirit.

"The problem is from now on. Even if you create a sacred light body, deploying a halo is on a different dimension. You must be able to draw a perfect circle. If the circle is even slightly distorted, the speed of light calculations becomes markedly slower, and even if it's only 0.1 percent slower, angel abilities become impossible to implement."

Humans cannot draw perfect circles. But it's not impossible in the realm of the mind. What's important is grasping the mathematical concept of a circle.

It wasn't easy, but it was a barrier that had to be overcome.

"That's the first difficulty. The second is even more serious. Angel abilities come from the enormous amount of information accumulated in the halo. In terms of formulas, it's an amount that would be insufficient even if a human recorded for their entire lifetime. Computing that at the speed of light is the essence of the halo."

Shirone recalled the scene where Ikael had caused the Galliant volcano to erupt. The ability to increase a dormant volcano's activity by 20,000 times and make it explode as an active volcano exceeded human limits.

"A perfect circle is one thing, but what about the formulas? A human mind can't instantly calculate the enormous information needed to make a volcano explode."

"But there is insight. Here, I'll try one thing. We'll perform a mental fusion. I'll become Shirone and use the halo. Then that experience will be converted entirely to Shirone's experience and remain in your mind."

"Such a method..."

Ikael's eyes became sharp.

"Don't call it a method. It's no different from the most extreme violence that can be inflicted on a human. If we're careless, Shirone's mind will shatter. And my mind, which has merged with Shirone's, won't be safe either."

Shirone felt nauseous. If it was to save his friends, he didn't mind his mind being destroyed. He'd risked his life from the beginning. But if even Ikael would be in danger, it wasn't something he could decide rashly.

"Even if I fail..."

"Shirone, don't think of anything else. I said I would help you. Don't worry about me, just think about saving your friends right now."

Shirone calmed his mind through deep breathing. As she said, it was something that had to be done.

"What's the third difficulty?"

"Even if the magic circle's formula is completed, whether you can withstand it is another problem. Without mental durability backing you up, Shirone will face destruction. Of course, this is separate from my danger. But if you can't endure it, it's better not to attempt this from the beginning."

"Don't worry about that. I'll definitely endure it."

He was confident about this last barrier. Since entering magic school, his mind had shown strengths in durability.

Moreover, having reached the state of Diamond Body, he thought he could endure to some degree.

"You don't understand. I know Shirone has mental strength that will never collapse. But that alone might not be enough."

"You'll never collapse but might collapse anyway? That seems contradictory."

"No. The former and latter are at different conceptual levels. If it's a vessel to contain Shirone's mind, the current durability would be sufficient. But concepts born from higher dimensions like angels are different in quality. It might be a vessel sufficient for containing water, but if that water freezes, any vessel will inevitably break."

"I see."

It was one mountain after another. Among the three difficulties she presented, there wasn't one that could be easily overcome.

No, perhaps this was normal.

It was a human learning an archangel's magic circle, so it was right to accept this level of risk from the beginning.

"The halo will make Shirone's mind explode from within. The choice is Shirone's. If you want to try even knowing such dangers, I will help."

For angels, mental collapse was equivalent to the extinction of life.

If Ikael would help by staking everything, Shirone had no reason to refuse.

Not only for his friends, but the opportunity to learn an archangel's true methods would never come again.

"I'll do it. No, please do it. Whatever the result, I'll accept it."

"Good. The technique I'll perform on Shirone from now on is called possession. It's dominating humans by merging with their minds. Usually, dispatched angels use this to convey Ra's will."

Shirone had read about possession through various literature. At the time he'd been half-believing, but now that an archangel was speaking directly, there was no room for doubt.

"If possession succeeds, my mind and Shirone's will merge. If I harbor evil intentions, harming Shirone would be easy. Also, if Shirone loses purity, that evil will seep into me."

It was a warning that irreversible consequences would occur if they weren't careful with each other.

Shirone nodded readily again this time too. Because there was no way Ikael would harbor evil intentions.

Also, she wasn't such a weak angel that she couldn't control it even if purity were lost.
