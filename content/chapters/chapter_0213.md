"I'll trust you. I won't let any anxiety arise."

Ikael smiled. It was fortunate that Shirone was such a quick-witted boy.

"That's exactly it. Now let's begin."

Ikael closed her eyes and cast possession.

As her sacred light body penetrated into Shirone's mind, Shirone's eyes widened.

Flashes burst from his pupils, and the strange sensation of two minds merging was transmitted.

*—Shirone, how do you feel?*

*—Huh? What is this...?*

Shirone, experiencing possession for the first time, was bewildered.

He couldn't distinguish whether the thoughts now arising in his mind were his own or Ikael's.

It felt like a madman acting out two people by himself.

*—Don't be confused. I am Shirone, and Shirone is me. Just let your thoughts arise naturally.*

He understood the method, but even the thoughts that just arose felt like his own delusions, giving him chills.

Did he really have to think that? It seemed like he could think any number of other thoughts if he tried.

*—Don't doubt it! If you start doubting, everything that makes up Shirone will collapse. Possession is a sensitive technique. Just accept it.*

Shirone decided to simply believe. Even if the thoughts in his head were nothing more than his own delusions, he concluded they were truth.

As his mind became at ease, his heartbeat regained stability.

Despite the incident, the angel's magic formation hadn't even begun yet.

Ikael decided to overcome the first hurdle.

*—Now I'm going to create a sacred light body. Extract your mind outward.*

Shirone changed his Spirit Zone to separation form.

Though an angel's halo is located above the crown of the head, Shirone extended his Spirit Zone forward.

It was because that was the most familiar direction for humans.

*—Is this right?*

*—Yes. No, well done. Whatever you do, Shirone's decision is important. You must find the most efficient method yourself. Now we're going to create the halo that will become the framework of the magic formation. Draw a perfect circle with light.*

Shirone waited without thinking anything. Then no voice arose at all.

*—Um... do it now?*

*—Yes. Do it now.*

Shirone had expected some advice and was flustered. But thinking there must be a reason for this too, he expanded the light into a ring shape.

A halo with a diameter of one meter was born in front of Shirone.

At least to the eye, it looked quite impressive.

It was a neat circle with appropriate brightness. This seemed comparable to an angel's halo.

*—Completely insufficient. With such a distorted circle, you cannot calculate massive amounts of information.*

As expected, Ikael's criticism was heard. When examined at units imperceptible to human eyes, it was apparently a complete mess.

He couldn't find a method. A perfect circle was merely a concept. How could he implement something that didn't exist anywhere in the world?

*—A perfect circle?*

Shirone suddenly realized. There was one thing - the only perfect circle that existed in this world.

*—That's right, Shirone. It's the Immortal Function. That's why the Nephilim are called descendants of angels.*

Opening the Immortal Function and expanding the mind to its limit. Only that was a perfect circle.

Because the whole is always perfect.

*—But if that happens...*

The existence called "I" would disappear. Hadn't he already experienced this in the Labyrinth of Time and Space?

*—You must operate the Immortal Function at 100 percent. Then catch it again and implement it as form. I'll control it, but it's definitely dangerous. Can you do it?*

He had to return from the infinite realm. This was the first gateway necessary to master an archangel's abilities.

*—I'll try. Since I've done it once, the second time should be easier.*

In truth, he didn't think it would be easy at all. But if he didn't say something lighthearted, he felt he'd go crazy from the tension.

Shirone opened the Immortal Function.

It was a release without brakes or hesitation. His mind decomposed and spread infinitely.

Shirone's mind became the Akashic Records. But since it was already perfect in itself, he could obtain no information whatsoever.

*—Shirone! Shirone! Listen to my voice! You must not let yourself go! Engrave this sensation in your heart! Pull it in with Diamond Body!*

Shirone pulled his mind, decomposed to its smallest units, within the boundaries of Diamond Body.

A massive ring of light swept up everything and surged into Shirone's mind.

A sound sharp and cold as cutting glass erupted. Then before Shirone's eyes, a perfect halo without an inch of error was born.

The speed of light rotating along the halo as a rail was literally light speed. Though it had emerged in separation form, Spirit Zone was still a magician's mind. With such a thing spinning in his mind, his thoughts were nearly paralyzed.

In short, Shirone had implemented the concept called Immortal Function in the real world.

Ikael's voice became sharp.

*—Shirone! Now I will inscribe the archangel's unique omniscience onto Shirone's halo! You must not release Diamond Body. You must endure to survive!*

A red flash shot out from the front and collided with the center of the halo.

Red ripples spread as the simplest computational magic formation distinguishing between 1 and 0 was born.

From there, the equations gradually began to grow complex.

Colored flashes from unknown origins collided with the halo like a downpour, carving magic formations.

Countless magic formations meshed like gears and rotated.

The sight of magic formations rotating at different sizes, different speeds, and in different directions was reminiscent of a clock's mechanism.

Shirone's mind was on the verge of bursting.

The first gear turned several gears, and those gears in turn rotated hundreds of gears.

The scale of computation was growing larger.

At some point, Shirone gave up calculating.

He couldn't understand the meaning contained in the halo.

How could he know what concept 170,000 computational circuits and 4,800 magic formations were trying to reveal?

"Ugh!"

Blood flowed from his nose. He gritted his teeth and tried to endure, but equations numbering 100 million lines were endlessly rolling upward. Calculating this transcended human limits.

*—Shirone! Don't try to understand! I'm understanding it! Accept it through the circuit of insight!*

Shirone realized Ikael's intention.

There was no need to calculate. She was trying to simplify the complex concept into truth and imprint it directly onto Shirone's brain.

When the number of magic formations carved into the halo surpassed 40,000, Shirone could experience the realm of gods.

It was none other than the computational speed of light.

Yet the fact that it was taking so long meant the concept contained in the halo transcended human capacity.

Though he couldn't yet know what it was, it was certainly something of unimaginable vastness.

*—This won't work. I can't anymore...*

Cracks began to appear in Diamond Body.

It was natural, since a human was forcibly accepting omniscience contained by a higher-dimensional being.

This was the third hurdle Ikael had mentioned.

*—We're almost there, Shirone! Just endure a little more...!*

Shirone's aftereffects began to affect Ikael.

As the computation progress rate exceeded 90 percent, the magic formation automatically proceeded toward completion.

Shirone's mind was in a supersaturated state. It felt like a bomb someone had planted in his head had exploded.

He could feel countless cracks forming in Diamond Body. His mind was breaking. That meant he was going insane.

Indeed, Shirone's mind was heading toward serious destruction.

Ikael watched with pity. Even if the magic formation was completed, he ultimately wouldn't be able to endure. When the information load reached 100 percent, Diamond Body would explode.

At that moment, a special change occurred in Shirone's mind.

Diamond Body was shattering into countless fragments beyond mere cracks. If this was Shirone's current mental state...

Even Ikael got chills thinking about it.

But the result was different from expectations.

Though Diamond Body's durability was converging to zero, the form of his mind remained completely unchanged.

To use an analogy of Diamond Body as an iron sphere filled with water, Shirone's current state was the process of water freezing.

When water begins to freeze, the iron sphere breaks.

But what about a rubber ball? It would only expand in size to match the increased volume of ice.

Therefore, Shirone had pulverized durability down to particle units to add flexibility.

Softness overcomes hardness.

Shirone's iron sphere had shattered to pieces, but the form of the ice contained within remained exactly the same.

Ikael's heart grew warm. Was this human resilience? Though his mind had been ground to powder, though it must be tremendous mental agony, Shirone had maintained his sanity to the very end.

That will evolved Shirone's mind one step further. This was the evolved form of Diamond Body, the realm of Diamond State.

The framework was broken. Only the contents remained.

Since there was nothing left to destroy, Shirone could remain unshaken in any situation.

If Diamond Body was the extreme of durability, then Diamond State with its vanished framework was the extreme of flexibility that humans pursue.

The information density carved into the halo exceeded 95 percent. It was truly an enormous amount of information.

But Diamond Body expanded its size to match the increased volume. Then it compressed again to contain the angel's information.

*—Congratulations, Shirone.*

Ikael sent unstinting praise. Could a human really traverse such extremes?

Shirone had come to possess both strength and flexibility simultaneously. It was an undoubtable leap forward.

Buried in angelic information, Shirone couldn't think anything. He only tried to endure, realizing only that it had become easier than before.

When the angel's magic formation was completed, his consciousness finally returned.

The halo with dozens of magic formations rotating at different speeds entered his view. Probably hundreds of times more magic formations were operating inside.

It was truly a beautiful magic formation.

The Halo that Ikael had cast entered entirely into Shirone's experience. Though he couldn't understand the principle, he could stamp out the completed concept like a seal.

*—I did it, Ikael...*

With those words, Shirone closed his eyes. As consciousness faded, the world was swallowed by darkness.

@

Shirone frowned at the intense light. When he opened his eyes, Ikael was looking down at him with a worried expression.

"Are you alright, Shirone? How do you feel?"

Shirone sat up. Somehow he felt a bit embarrassed.

He had already lost consciousness twice since meeting Ikael. He thought that associating with higher-dimensional beings was quite an arduous affair.

Shirone grabbed his throbbing head and asked.

"How long was I unconscious this time?"

"A bit long. About 20 minutes."

"What? Why...?"

Ikael could have easily woken him before then.

When Shirone looked back in disbelief, Ikael said with an apologetic expression.

"Shirone was in shock. Even if I had forcibly woken you, you wouldn't have been able to fight in peak condition. Especially to use the angel's magic formation, you'll need to pour out all of Shirone's mental power."

Ikael's words were right. But the fact that time had been delayed was still worrisome.

"Don't worry. Through this incident, Shirone's mental power has become stronger. Moreover, since you've recovered sufficiently, you'll be able to reach the destination faster than before."

Shirone examined his own changes. A much more powerful effect was occurring in his body than when he had reached the realm of Diamond Body.

As his mind was drawn to depths several times deeper than before, Shirone regained confidence once more.

'If I go at maximum speed, I can make up for lost time. What happened to Rian and Canis?'

By rough estimate, they had arrived or were nearly there. By that calculation, there was still a chance to catch up.
