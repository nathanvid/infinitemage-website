Shirone recalled how he had only thought about his own situation and turned to look at Ikael.

"Ah, um..."

Ikael shook her head.

"No. You don't need to thank me. This situation happening is also my oversight. Rather, I'm sorry that this is all I can do to help. From now on, it's up to you, Shirone."

"Thank you. I truly mean it."

Shirone insisted on expressing his gratitude. If it hadn't been for Ikael, he would still be sitting against Jebul's walls, crying.

Ikael's eyes became gentle. Even his stubborn appearance was endearing.

"Remember this, Shirone. As you already know, there won't be many opportunities to use my ability. Even though your mind has evolved to the next level. Kariel is a cautious angel. Only use it when you're certain you can save your friend."

Shirone nodded and prepared to leave. Though it was regrettable to part with Ikael, there was no time to delay.

"Be careful. I hope you can safely return to your original world."

"Yes. Thank you so much."

As Shirone left the room and the door closed, Ikael sat down with a weary expression.

The room left alone was still perfect, but somehow it felt lacking.

Shirone had been here. Recalling the exciting events, Ikael burst into laughter.

'I'm glad it was Shirone.'

Ikael's sacred light body opened into a halo and rotated rapidly. Then a red whirlpool swirled in one corner of the room.

"Answer my call, Ashur."

Square glass panels appeared in front of Ikael.

Dozens of glass panels connected by intersecting lines sparkled, gradually taking on color as Mara's form was projected.

It was a handsome man with jet-black hair flowing to his shoulders, with three triangles floating above his head.

Kneeling before Ikael, he bowed his head and spoke.

"Ashur. I receive the angel's command."

The boundary lines of the glass panels disappeared as Ashur's form gained three-dimensional depth.

"I need your power. Please help Shirone."

"Understood."

Ashur answered without hesitation. Ikael's eyes filled with apologetic emotion.

"I'm sorry for making you do this kind of work."

"I am a being born from Lady Ikael's concept. I will follow any command whatsoever."

Supreme-level Mara are direct attendants of archangels. Therefore, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say they're the busiest in Heaven, making them beings you couldn't just summon at will.

Particularly Ashur, who was called Heaven's strongest demonic swordsman and Ikael's escort knight. Though his power was currently sealed, this wasn't a position for running errands.

Ashur spoke boldly.

"Please don't worry. If it's something Lady Ikael treasures, then it's precious to me as well. I will stake my existence's annihilation and certainly complete the mission."

"Thank you. But Kariel is strong. Moreover, Ymir, the king of giants, is currently moving in Jebul."

At the mention of Ymir, Ashur's eyes blazed intensely.

"I don't know what thoughts he has for taking interest in this matter, but we must be cautious. Ymir is one who has reached the ultimate force that living beings can pursue. Nothing good comes from getting entangled in complications."

Ashur's face openly displayed displeasure. He was Heaven's strongest demonic swordsman, but the position of Heaven's greatest warrior was always split between Ymir and himself.

This was because there were views that highly valued Ymir, who had reached the strongest position through physical ability alone.

But Ashur didn't acknowledge it. Someday, they would have to compete to determine who was the strongest.

"Don't worry. Ymir is no match for me."

Ikael realized she had scratched the warrior's pride and soothed him with a gentle tone.

"Hehe, of course I think Ashur is the strongest. Even if Ymir came in perfect condition, if Ashur protects me, I wouldn't be afraid at all."

Only then did Ashur seem satisfied as he stood up.

"Of course. As long as I exist, no one will be able to lay even a fingertip on Lady Ikael."

"Oh, and one more thing."

Ashur, who had turned around at the door, looked at his respected master with a tense expression.

In Ikael's narrowed eyes resided an unapproachable dignity.

"If you meet Kariel, be sure to convey these words."

**Heaven's Turmoil (1)**

Shirone came down from the tower and looked around Arabot's open field.

Igirin's memory was teaching him the path to Jebul. It was quite a distance to go by teleportation.

Entering his Spirit Zone, massive information flowed in through synesthesia.

"Wow..."

He knew his concentration had increased. But experiencing it firsthand was almost unbelievable.

While maintaining the same density as before, his Spirit Zone's diameter had increased by 1.5 times. Converting to volume, his mental power had risen nearly fourfold.

In other words, the burden of casting magic had been reduced by four times.

As his Spirit Zone grew larger than before, he felt as free as if he had thrown off heavy baggage.

Shirone aimed at Jebul in target form and drew up spatial movement's omniscience.

Until now, the effect hadn't been significant, but with the diameter increased by 25 meters, he could now apply it in actual combat.

Looking at just 25 meters might not seem like much difference, but when transformed into Four-Direction Style target form, the additional distance would extend to 100 meters.

Just by linking spatial movement 10 times, he would gain an increase of over 1 kilometer.

'Everyone wait. Just hold on a little longer.'

Thinking of his friends' situation made his heart unbearably anxious. But Shirone's concentration, having reached the Diamond Body realm, didn't waver in the slightest.

As omniscience and omnipotence combined, the noise of light embroidered the sky.

A streak of light shot toward Jebul's direction.

@

Rian had been running for 30 minutes already. His heart was beating as if it would burst, but the amount of oxygen inhaled in one breath remained constant. If he used up all his oxygen at once, he would collapse before reaching his destination.

It was time for Canis to have produced some result.

Rian thought it was one of two things: either he had disabled the Great World Hall's security system, or he was dead.

He shook his head to clear his thoughts. This wasn't the time to worry about others.

If Canis had failed, then the next one to die would be himself.

"Huff! Huff!"

Though he didn't have the ability to make his body light like Tess, his lifelong trained physique wouldn't tire even after running for over an hour.

After running like that, he arrived at the final point connected to the Great World Hall.

The right side of the corridor was blocked by full-length glass, beyond which blue sky spread out.

Since Jebul was in the form of dozens of floating plates, this was the outermost edge of one plate. Therefore, if he continued running along the outer edge, he would reach the bridge leading to the Great World Hall.

Just as Rian, who had estimated his position, was about to launch his body again, some object floating on the ceiling caught his attention.

A drone was approaching in a flustered manner.

Though the drone was just a machine, Tess's urgent feelings were conveyed through its movements.

"Tess? Are you safe?"

The drone nodded up and down. It seemed no fatal situation had occurred yet.

Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump.

The sound of the ground rumbling came from the path Rian had traveled. Turning around, he saw a large man striding toward him with big steps.

Rian drew his Signa and Exd.

An enemy of unknown identity. Above the approaching man's head, neither a sacred light body nor horns were visible.

The first thing that came to mind was a giant.

Though he was too small for a giant, the shaking ground with each step suggested his power.

'What a monster. How heavy must his muscles be to have that kind of weight?'

The giant's movement was heavy. But with each step, his body kept moving forward smoothly.

Thump!

The giant stopped towering in front of Rian by stomping his sole down.

It was a kind of display of power.

It was impossible without the muscle strength to suppress inertia with a single blow.

"What are you?"

Ymir asked. He truly didn't know, so he was asking.

Since he was holding Signa and Exd, he must be a Mecha, but his appearance resembled a Norse.

"What are you saying?"

Giants couldn't understand language since mental resonance was impossible.

Ymir was the same, but he didn't mind. Rather than language, he was gauging the quality of martial prowess.

"I see. You're the heretic who caused trouble in Heaven."

As fighting spirit emanated from Ymir's body, Rian instinctively stepped back and raised his sword.

When the human he expected to wet himself and flee instead pointed a blade at him, Ymir's heart moved intensely. The moment when gazes clashed was his favorite time.

'Good eyes. You've sharpened yourself quite well for a human.'

Rian pulled his left foot back. Considering the weight difference, it would be difficult to compete with strength. The top priority strategy was to finish quickly the moment an opening appeared.

"Reveal your identity. Are you enemy or ally? If you intend to interfere, you cannot pass through here."

Though Ymir couldn't understand Rian's words, he could read a hundred words in those intense eyes.

'Choose, is it? But that's my role...'

Ymir walked forward with big strides.

Though it seemed like a brutish approach, it was perfectly timed to cut off Rian's breathing.

Rian, who had aimed for a surprise attack, felt frustrated as he retreated.

Ymir felt pleasure at this sight.

The battle had already begun. He loved all the emotions that arose from the moment they decided to kill each other.

Ymir, who had approached Rian, spoke.

"Enemy."

Rian's hair stood on end.

The giant's aura rushing in momentarily was like a massive barrier. It was so large that he couldn't see the whole of it.

"Shall we begin?"

At that moment, mechanical sounds came from the drone on the ceiling.

"Language. Understanding. Decoding. Shall we begin?"

Ymir's gaze momentarily shifted to the ceiling. When he lowered his gaze again, Rian had already disappeared.

"Taha!"

Ymir raised his arm to block the Signa flying in from the side. A powerful shockwave exploded, and the giant's skin rippled like water in a strong wind.

But his body didn't budge an inch.

Ymir, who pushed up the Signa with his arm, tilted his face to glare at Rian.

It was the gaze of a snake eyeing its prey.

"Nice ambush. That's why I feel sorry. If you're a swordsman, I should respond with a sword too."

With his words, Ymir pushed away the Signa. Then his body's left and right reversed as a powerful hook swung in.

Rian thrust out his Exd and crouched his body.

When Ymir's fist struck the shield, a roar erupted as the Exd's hologram struck Ymir powerfully.

But this time too, Ymir didn't retreat. Rather, it was Rian who was sent flying.

Rian, who rolled on the floor, knelt and regained his balance.

The Exd mounted on his arm was revealing its innards as if hit by a cannon.

Ymir raised his face over his shoulder and grinned wickedly.

"As you can see... there aren't many weapons that can withstand my strength."

"Damn it, how embarrassing..."

Tess's gaze was conveyed from the ceiling through the drone. Imagining what feelings she was watching with while waiting for help made his blood boil even more.

"Here I come!"

Rian charged at full speed.

Throwing his Signa in an irregular pattern, he soared into the air while drawing the great sword from his back.

Ymir caught the rushing Signa and crushed it like a cookie.

At the same time, Rian brought down his great sword.

Ymir's fist, holding the Signa, flew toward him.

At the clang, Rian was shocked. He had blocked the sword blade with the bones of his fist. It felt like striking iron.

Rian flew in the reverse motion of his sword swing. Ymir immediately pursued and raised his fist.

"That was fun. I'll give you a gift."

"Huuup!"

Rian stabbed his great sword into the ground. Using the flat surface as a shield, he pressed his shoulder and thigh against it and put all his weight into it.
