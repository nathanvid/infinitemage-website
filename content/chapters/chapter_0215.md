*Thwack!*

The moment Ymir's straight punch landed, Rian's figure vanished, leaving only his great sword behind.

All sorts of thoughts rushed through Rian's mind as he flew through the air. To block any follow-up attacks, he needed to regain his center and land properly. He barely managed to regain his balance. It seemed like he could land on both feet.

But the next moment, he realized his body was crumpled up, rolling across the floor.

As the lingering shock left his body, the cold sensation of the floor touched his cheek.

An incomprehensible sound leaked from his mouth. Though his body wasn't particularly hurt, he couldn't muster any strength.

Ymir examined Rian sprawled on the ground before picking up the great sword that had fallen to the floor. Though it was a great sword for humans, it looked like an ordinary longsword when Ymir held it.

Ymir's eyes gleamed as he examined the sword's blade.

"Hmm? This might be quite useful."

"Give it... back. That's... my grandfather's..."

Rian struggled to his feet, his legs trembling.

Thanks to training his body to its limits every day, his recovery time from shock was much faster than normal people. It was what you'd call toughness.

Ymir grinned, splitting his lips, and threw the great sword. It slid across the floor and reached Rian.

"Going to try again? I like your spirit."

Rian painfully picked up the great sword and charged again. Though the gap in strength was clear, if Ymir was heading to the Great World Hall, there was no choice but to fight.

Ymir and Rian collided in the center of the corridor. Ymir didn't even think to block the great sword.

*Clang!* The great sword struck Ymir's forehead. No, it was more accurate to say he blocked it with his forehead.

Ymir's fist traced a large arc as it flew toward him.

He couldn't avoid it. Realizing this fact, Rian's eyes widened. If he had to die, he wanted to fight until the very last moment.

From Rian's gaze, Ymir tasted a thrilling sensation.

'It's unfortunate I don't know his name.'

Ymir's fist created a fierce wind as it passed through where Rian had been.

Silence lingered for a while.

Ymir's expression turned unpleasant. Was there anything more irritating than uninvited guests interrupting a battle?

A strange but familiar phenomenon.

Just before his fist connected, he clearly saw Rian split into dozens of squares.

"Anyway... high-ranking types never know how to read the mood."

About three meters from where Rian had been, square glass panels flickered before projecting the figures of two people.

Ashur, a black-haired handsome man. And beside him, Rian was kneeling.

Ymir laughed coldly. The mere fact that Mara, famous in heaven for being sedentary, had made an appearance was enough to guess that something serious was happening at the Great World Hall.

"Well, well, a busy person has arrived. Where did you leave your beloved while you're poking around a battlefield?"

"Ymir, if you don't follow the law, unpleasant things will happen. Return now."

"Haha, what if I refuse?"

"Then I'll have no choice but to annihilate your existence."

As Ashur spread his palm, about thirty glass panels lined up in three columns in the air. Long, slender swords emitting purple light were projected on them.

"Signal?"

Ashur's ability Signal collected all types of signals.

One glass panel contained one signal, and by combining the patterns of these panels, he could implement phenomena approaching infinity.

Ashur's sword 'Shockwave' was also created by receiving thirty different signals.

Due to the influence of electromagnetic pulses, it vibrated on its own, making it a weapon with maximum lethality that would devastate the interior once it penetrated.

Rian stared blankly up at Ashur. Like someone who had died and been reborn, the middle process had been omitted.

"Who are you?"

"Go. I'm an ally."

Though it was a brief statement, he could understand immediately. Shirone must have created some variable.

Rian glared at Ymir. But he hadn't even looked at him since Ashur appeared.

Rian bit his lip and ran toward the Great World Hall.

Fire boiled up inside him. He hadn't grown up noble enough to fear defeat. But the self-loathing of not succeeding with even a single attack pained his heart.

He felt Tess's drone following behind. Though the machine remained silent to the end, he seemed to hear her comforting voice like a hallucination.

"Damn it! Damn it!"

Rian ran with all his might toward the Great World Hall.

@

Ashur was still blocking the path. He wanted to follow Rian to the Great World Hall, but stopping Ymir was the immediate priority.

Using Signal's ability 'transmission,' he could send a signal to his desired destination and instantly move locations, but the Great World Hall was impossible.

The place was plastered with electromagnetic waves, so running was faster than waiting for a signal to be transmitted.

That was also why he had sent Rian ahead.

"Stand down, Ymir. I won't tolerate any more indulgence."

Ymir stroked his chin as he spoke.

"Seeing as you've come here abandoning even that pretty angel, something important must have happened. How about letting me know too instead of being so secretive?"

"It's none of your business."

"Somehow it sounds like it is my business."

Ashur didn't deny it.

What Ymir, the King of Giants, wanted was battle. Having had his body stolen simply for being strong, he was waiting for fierce battles that could only be won using his original body's power.

On the other hand, Ikael's position was that war must be prevented.

If Ikael wished it, Ashur would follow as well.

As long as he stepped forward, nothing would happen in heaven. Therefore, there was no reason for Ymir to be interested anywhere.

Ashur aimed Shockwave at Ymir's solar plexus.

"By the command of Archangel Ikael, I will strip you of all rights granted to you."

"Haha, did such lowly angels have that authority too?"

Ashur rushed in like a gale.

Ymir crossed both arms, and his forearms split as blood spurted. The vibration of electromagnetic waves burned his bones hot.

Ashur pressed down on Ymir with an insulted gaze.

"How dare a mere giant blaspheme an archangel? You are nothing but flesh. Don't defile a noble spirit with your disgusting tongue."

"A mere giant?"

One of Ymir's eyebrows twitched.

"I am Ymir."

Sensing killing intent, Ashur created distance. But Ymir caught up ten meters with a single leap.

Ymir's powerful straight punch pierced through his abdomen.

"Kugh!"

Shock filled Ashur's pupils.

His figure, frozen in time, became blurry, and the 180 or so glass panels containing signals flickered before disappearing.

Ymir turned around with an annoyed expression.

Ashur, having completed transmission to a new space, stood with a lofty bearing, letting Shockwave hang down.

"Haha, aren't you pushing yourself too hard? I heard the restraints on your power are severe."

"I'm not in a position to receive sympathy from you. You'd better properly manage your own flesh."

"Is that so?"

"Hell of Ice and Flame."

The space surrounding Ashur and Ymir was enclosed by glass panels.

Approximately 2,400 glass panels flickered as they began collecting signals of heat and cold. The sight of fire and ice alternating every ten centimeters was dizzying.

What would happen to this place once all signals were transmitted? Would it burn in heat? Would it freeze in cold?

"You brought this on yourself. Don't resent me."

"I resent no one. Because I am the strongest."

Ymir bared his teeth like a beast as he charged. In response, Ashur also raised his cold eyes and swung Shockwave.

As transmission completed, hot winds and cold air swirled simultaneously.

"Tess! Just wait a little more! We're almost there!"

Rian no longer conserved oxygen. After running for ten minutes since parting with Ashur, he could reach the bridge leading to the Great World Hall.

The bridge was one kilometer long and sixty meters wide. Without guardrails, it felt like floating in the sky. When strong winds blew, his lower abdomen churned for no reason.

At the end of the bridge stood a dome-shaped structure. It was the Great World Hall where his friends were being held captive.

Being able to see the building was good news. It meant Canis had disabled the Mecha System.

"What? You're still here?"

Looking back, Canis was approaching.

"How are you here already?"

"I came through a portal. By the way, why is your face like that? Like someone beat you up."

Rian touched his face. He didn't even have time to feel pain while rolling on the ground, so he didn't realize it was swollen. He looked up at the drone with apologetic feelings.

'You must have been worried, Tess.'

Canis also examined it. Without explanation, he could tell it was Tess's.

Letting the drone slip away even while being captured by angels was certainly impressive.

"How's the situation inside? You checked, right?"

"Yeah. It seems okay so far. But..."

Suddenly the drone's condition became strange. It flew around unable to find its bearings, then dropped as if its power had been cut.

Rian hurriedly caught it and examined it.

The operation lamp was off. Since it was equipment connected to brainwaves, it was evidence that something had happened to Tess.

"What? What's wrong all of a sudden?"

"I don't know! There's no time!"

Rian threw himself forward first. With Darkfort he could go in one shot, but the bridge floating in the sky was entirely within the domain of light.

Canis, who caught Rian, swallowed his pride and cast photonization magic.

A flash carrying both men raced across the bridge.

"You bastard!"

Amy glared at Kariel and shouted. Tess and Arin's faces were also contorted.

As information infiltrated from the panels implanted in their heads, their minds became dizzy as if they had drunk heavily.

"Nothing to worry about. Hormones are being regulated to a state suitable for the wine of life."

Kariel, who had been indifferently observing the women's condition, turned his gaze to the screen.

"Nothing particularly changes. It'll be different after the wine of life ends, but does it matter anyway? It's something any being must experience once if they're alive."

"Shut up! Why do you get to decide that! Do you think we'll do as you want? I'd rather bite my tongue and die than go through this!"

Kariel frowned as if seeing something disgusting.

"I can't understand. You're not being punished. You've been selected for the noble mission of conceiving Nephilim. There haven't been many women who've refused the wine of life until now. Don't you want eternal life?"

"I don't want eternal life! Even if I die tomorrow, I'll die doing what I want!"

"You're not making sense. Anyway, nothing changes. Once all the information in the panel is transmitted, it's impossible to reverse."

*—Wine of life progress 20 percent.*

A woman's voice came from the ceiling. It seemed to announce every 10 percent. From the perspective of test subjects, the emotionless voice was even more eerie.

Amy struggled desperately to escape from the handcuffs.

If she could just get her hands free, she planned to grab and yank out the panel implanted in her forehead.

Even if it cost her life, she would live her own life.

"Tess! Amy! Arin!"

The door of the Great World Hall opened roughly. Rian and Canis entered simultaneously as if racing.

Tess, who had been watching them cross the bridge, shouted.

"Rian! Over here! Hurry and untie this!"

Rian took a step forward then flinched. He was overwhelmed by the Great World Hall's size beyond imagination.

Not only its scale, but the equipment and devices were also unfamiliar.

On one side, planets were rotating, while on the opposite tower, all sorts of lights flashed gaudily.

"Damn! What is this place?"

Kariel flew up to a height where he could see all the humans at a glance.

"Did you follow the women? This must be another foolishness of ignorant humans."

"Are you the mastermind? Don't think this will end peacefully after doing this to my friends."

Rian raised his sword with extreme caution.

Despite his fierce words, his actions were prudent. Having seen the power of fallen angel Ikasa with his own eyes, Rian could estimate an archangel's might.
