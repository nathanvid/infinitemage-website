As Rian slowly closed the distance while looking for an opportunity to attack, Tess shouted in frustration.

"You blockhead! Fight later and untie us first!"

"Damn it! I want to, but...!"

He desperately wanted to rush over right away. However, turning his attention elsewhere while an archangel was on guard would be tantamount to suicide.

Arin explained calmly.

"Canis, the wine of life has already begun. You need to remove the panels attached to their foreheads. If you don't, we'll all end up bearing Nephilim."

Before Canis could respond, Rian's eyes widened as he shouted.

"What? You should have told me that first!"

"That's what I've been saying, you idiot! If you don't want to see me go crazy, hurry up and remove these handcuffs first!"

"Got it! Just wait a moment!"

One way or another, Rian and Tess had similar temperaments. Unlike mages who assess situations until they see a chance of victory, Rian rushed forward with the idea of removing the panels first.

At that moment, a shockwave erupted before his eyes. Rian, who had stepped back while receiving a stinging pain, raised his gaze. Kariel, floating in the air, was extending her hand with a displeased expression.

'What? That's nothing special?'

While it was surprising that a shockwave burst in empty space, its destructive power wasn't as strong as expected.

Rian, who had been intimidated by the title of archangel, gripped his great sword with newfound hope.

Canis was also taking note of the information Rian had obtained.

*—The archangel's abilities are lower than expected. This could be an opportunity for us.*

*—It must be because of the wine of life or whatever. Creating humans can't be easy work.*

*—True. But it's unexpected, isn't it? Even though we came here, she intends to continue as planned?*

Angels are strong, but they don't exist for combat.

For example, the ability of Archangel Ikael appeared to be activation, which had nothing to do with battle.

However, because that concept was so vast, any Mara, and even other angels, would tremble before it.

Kariel also possessed the vast concept of birth.

Explosions, ignition, machinery, drugs, and so on.

The number of things she could create by combining existing elements was nearly infinite.

But among all these, what Kariel took most pride in was life.

No matter what object she created, the energy focused on birth itself was enormous.

Especially if it was the wine of life that birthed living beings, even an archangel would have to pour most of her mental strength into it.

"How dare you interfere with an archangel's calling. Humans who don't even live 100 years are quite arrogant."

Canis secretly sent Harvest flowing into the darkness. The plan was to buy time and then ambush Kariel while rescuing the women.

"An angel's calling? What are you trying to do by creating Nephilim? We can find plenty of Unlockers in our world too."

Amy spoke up. She had seen through Canis's time-buying strategy.

"Heaven is trying to use Nephilim to attack the human world. Since there are more Unlockers on our side now, they're trying to balance the power."

"Conquest? Are you planning a war?"

"That's right. Nephilim aren't like divine apostles. They were spies dispatched to occupied territories."

Kariel didn't deny it. The thoughts of insignificant humans didn't matter to her at all.

Ra is great and angels are superior. There was no room for human concepts to interfere with what an archangel does.

"You should be grateful to us. Thanks to you, we can now wage the final war."

Amy's group's gazes focused on Kariel. The mention of a final war was unsettling, but they couldn't understand what it meant that they could now wage it.

"The final war?"

"Exactly as I said. The human world will soon be destroyed. Until now, the detestable Miro has been preventing the end, but because of you, the prelude to war has begun."

Canis was bewildered. The woman Shirone had been looking for was preventing the end?

Then he recalled Arcane's response. If humanity's extinction was at stake, it made sense that his master had erased his memory.

"But why do you say it's thanks to us? What did we do?"

"The woman called Miro is blocking the passage between Heaven and the human world. But through the Metagate you brought, a new path has opened. Soon Heaven's army will mercilessly burn the humans."

Everyone's hearts sank. If Kariel's words were true, they had committed an irreversible act. Humanity's extinction would be hastened because of them.

Kariel pointed to the mechanical device and shouted.

"Look! This is the Metagate that Ikasa brought! Once the wine of life is complete, we'll analyze the coordinates. The moment a new portal opens, your world will be destroyed!"

Amy's group's gazes turned simultaneously.

"......"

The Great World Hall fell silent. No one spoke.

When the expected reaction didn't come, a puzzled Kariel slowly turned her head. Then she too made the same expression.

"......"

A fairy holding the Metagate was staring at them with her mouth agape.

Kariel tried to say something but closed her mouth again.

Why was a fairy here? It went against the law, and even if it wasn't the law, it was a situation where no causality could be found.

Perhaps finding the silence awkward, Phoebe spoke first.

"Oh, hello."

Kariel tilted her head. Was she greeting her? If so, at least she wasn't insane. Hoping to find some reasonable explanation with this question, she spoke.

"Who are you?"

"I'm Phoebe."

Kariel felt a surge of emotion. However, showing emotion was undignified behavior, so she forced herself to remain calm.

"Yes, Phoebe. Why are you here?"

"Oh, I came to take the Metagate."

"...I see. Then why... *sigh*, why would someone like you want to take it?"

"Well, because there shouldn't be a war."

At that moment, Kariel's patience snapped. With the sole intention of obliterating the gnat before her eyes, she extended her hand.

In one strike, spectacularly.

"Die."

*—Harvest! Now's the time!*

Harvest burst out from the darkness of the Great World Hall.

The moment it swung its blade-like sharp shadow, Kariel flew up to the ceiling.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, Canis rushed toward the women while shouting.

"Rian! Protect Phoebe! She absolutely cannot be taken!"

Rian immediately changed direction and ran toward Phoebe. Although he wanted to rescue Tess immediately, in urgent situations it was better to listen to the mage.

"Phoebe! Come this way!"

Phoebe, who had been confused by the sudden battle, heard Rian's voice and flew over.

Kariel shook off Harvest's pursuit and aimed for Phoebe. However, when Rian got there first with his sword to guard the position, she abruptly changed direction and flew back to the ceiling.

Rian, who had breathed a sigh of relief, looked back at Phoebe.

"Phew, are you okay?"

"I don't know! I was so scared I thought I was going to die! Just take this quickly!"

Phoebe's face was as pale as soup. She had been in a situation where she had to provoke an archangel, no less. Even now, she couldn't understand how she had managed to respond.

Rian received the Metagate. Even someone as stoic as him couldn't help but be moved.

If he activated the Metagate right now, at least he could return home.

Of course, he had no such intention, but thinking about how much the situation had improved filled him with courage.

"Thanks, Phoebe."

"Don't get the wrong idea! I didn't do this to help you...!"

Phoebe stopped speaking. The situation was so obvious that she couldn't think of words to hide her true feelings.

She had defied an archangel's command and helped humans. It wasn't just breaking the law—it was completely burning it down.

Giving up on excuses, Phoebe complained resentfully.

"S-so what are you going to do about it? I'm finished now."

"Come with us."

"What?"

"Come with us. There are lots of interesting things in our world too. Since you saved us, we'll do our best to save you too."

Phoebe hurriedly turned away. Honestly, this was quite touching.

But she couldn't accept the offer. Going to the human world wasn't difficult, but she hadn't acted hoping for such a thing.

"Forget it, you fool! Think about it after you save your friends!"

While keeping watch of his surroundings, Rian checked on Canis's progress. Currently, Canis was cutting the women's handcuffs with the power of darkness.

*—Wine of life progress: 40 percent.*

When the voice came from the ceiling, Amy shouted.

"Hurry! We don't have time!"

"Be quiet, you pumpkin! If my concentration wavers, I might cut off wrists too!"

Canis was rotating blade-like sharp shadows to cut the handcuffs of the three women. Since they were in complete contact with the women's skin, precise work was required.

Kariel, moving to avoid Harvest, was gradually getting annoyed. She thought it might be better to cancel the wine of life and massacre them all.

There were probably about 50,000 ways to kill using the power of birth.

However, she couldn't cancel the wine of life.

Even though the information transmission rate had exceeded 40 percent, no positive reaction was appearing from any of the women.

'They're the finest materials. I absolutely cannot give up.'

As a last resort, Kariel opened a portal.

With her remaining mental strength, she could summon a fairly decent Mara, and she even thought of the perfect candidate for the situation.

"Answer the call, Baalb."

When a new Mara appeared, the Great World Hall was tinted with an ominous color. Everyone except Canis looked up at the ceiling and first checked the number of horns.

It was a two-horned Mara.

"Sleep demon Baalb. I receive Kariel-nim's command."

He was a stylishly aged middle-aged man. His hair was slicked back with oil, and his exposed ears were pointed.

He was tall enough to match an angel, wearing a feathered cloak that rose higher than his head.

"Subdue the humans. The wine of life must not be disturbed."

"That is certainly my specialty. Understood."

Baalb placed his right hand on his chest and landed on the ground.

"Phoebe, hold this for a moment."

After entrusting the Metagate to Phoebe, Rian charged at Baalb. However, even though he charged with resolve to die, he couldn't even get close. The moment he approached Baalb, his mind became hazy and his consciousness began to blur.

'What? Suddenly feeling sleepy...'

Feeling sleepy in a life-or-death battle situation was impossible unless one was insane.

It was definitely some kind of ability.

Having realized this much, Rian hastily retreated.

Once he left the invisible domain, his consciousness returned. However, the fatigue from sleep deprivation remained in his body.

It was an infuriating situation.

"Damn it, what kind of nonsense is this now?"

From giants to fairies, from Mara to angels—every single one had ridiculous abilities. Looking back, he felt ashamed that he had only been a burden to his friends since coming to Heaven.

Baalb turned his body with a dignified bearing.

"It's useless. You won't even be able to swing your sword at me."

Red gems were slowly circling around Baalb. Perhaps those were the problem?

He took a swordsmanship stance and slowly closed the distance. As expected, when he passed a certain boundary line, the red gems emitted light and drowsiness began pouring over him again.

'Damn. So it was those things. What the hell are they?'

No one knew the identity of the gems, but only the magical creature Harvest read their unique wavelength.

*—Canis, this is a bad situation. It would be better to retreat for now. It's an Objet.*

*—Objet? That's an Objet?*

Canis had also only heard about it from Arcane and was seeing one for the first time.

An Objet is an object.

The difference from ordinary objects is that it exerts strange influence on the external world.

Some Objets are familiar even to humans.

Cursed blue diamonds or flying carpets fell into this category.

Since humans also collect them quite a bit, it wasn't strange for Mara who had traveled through countless worlds to possess one or two.

Some Mara's blood-sucking Objet was said to absorb blood from the surroundings. Also, a hatred Objet could incite rage and cause murder.

Baalb's Objet was a sleep Objet—an item that would make any living being within its sphere of influence fall asleep.
