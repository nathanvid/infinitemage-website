As the gem's rotation accelerated, its influence reached even Canis.

An overwhelming drowsiness washed over him. He bit his lips, trying to resist, but if he continued cutting the handcuffs in this state, the women's wrists would be severed.

'No! I can't leave Arin behind!'

Blood seeped from his bitten lips.

Amy and Tess, watching him, could offer no advice.

Only Arin could stop him.

"Canis, there's still time. Fall back for now. At this rate, you'll collapse first."

"Damn it! Damn it!"

He knew he had to retreat.

Just a little more cutting would do it. If he had overwhelming power like his master, he would have cut through all the handcuffs by now.

—Information transmission rate 50 percent.

"I'll definitely save you. Just wait a little longer."

Unable to meet the women's eyes, Canis moved away from the Objet's area of influence.

As if by magic, his mind cleared. But the pain from earlier wasn't forgotten. It was a compulsive force incomparable to sleep magic.

'Right, compulsive force. That's the characteristic of Objets.'

Objets were mutations of the physical world. Due to some cosmic error, the very concept of objects had been twisted.

Therefore, since they didn't violate causality, it was impossible to block an Objet's ability by any means.

Moreover, there wasn't much time left. Summoning a sleep demon in a time-limited situation was an excellent choice.

"Rian, stay back. I'll handle this."

Canis switched places with Rian. For a swordsman with weak mental abilities, the sleep Objet was nothing short of poison.

Phoebe pointed toward the entrance of the Great World Hall and shouted.

"Everyone! Look over there!"

The giant Ymir was running toward them, leading his massive body.

Rian's eyes tensed with focus. He felt smaller than when they first met, but it was definitely that giant.

Even the composed Canis couldn't hide his anger this time.

"Damn it! Even the giant is coming!"

"Stay calm. I'll handle the giant. You take care of Baalb."

Considering their compatibility, it was the right judgment. But even aside from compatibility, Rian wanted to face him directly.

In their first encounter, he hadn't even managed to inflict a fatal wound, but this time it was his turn to show his specialty.

When Rian reached the entrance, Phoebe flew over carrying the Metagate.

"Hey, what about this?"

"Guard it for me. We'll definitely return."

"What? How can I handle something this important...!"

Phoebe couldn't finish her sentence. Though it was a burdensome and overwhelming request, seeing Rian's face, she couldn't say anything.

It wasn't the face of someone who said they would definitely return.

"But if you find yourself in a dangerous situation..."

Rian looked back at Phoebe with a gentle smile.

"Just throw that thing away and run if that happens. It's not more precious than life."

Phoebe pressed her lips together and made an angry expression.

How could he say such things? Why were humans all nothing but fools?

"Don't talk nonsense! Why can't you be honest? You want me to protect this even if I die! Without this, you can't return!"

Rian gave no answer.

"You fool! Your opponent is Ymir! King of the giants, Ymir! If you fight, you'll definitely die!"

Rian finally learned. His name was Ymir? Not just any giant, but the king of giants.

Then there was no shortage as a final opponent.

Phoebe's heart felt heavy. Was this human life? Because it was as brief as a mayfly compared to fairies, were they desperately trying to burn it up?

Rian blocked the entrance. Strangely, his silhouette against the backlight looked larger, like a solar eclipse.

"Your name... what's your name..."

Phoebe forced her voice to work despite her choked throat.

"What's your name?"

She asked Rian. Revealing names in heaven was dangerous, but Phoebe felt she needed to know. They had come to trust each other now.

"I am Ozent Rian."

Rian, holding up his great sword, looked back at Phoebe and said.

"Shirone's sword."

Thud!

Driving his great sword deep into the ground, Rian leaned his back against the blade and lowered his center of gravity.

Ymir approached with a grotesque grin splitting his face.

"Kekeke! A second bout? That's what makes someone worthy of being called a warrior."

"Come at me, king of giants."

Ymir charged without slowing down.

Feeling the overwhelming pressure like a boulder rolling toward him, Rian took a receiving stance and let out a battle cry.

"Uaaaaaaah!"

Ymir's crouched shoulder crashed into Rian's upper body.

The great sword bent as if it might snap, then sprang back with elasticity.

Crack!

The sound of something breaking came from inside Rian's belly. Blood spurting from his throat painted the sky red.

Shockwave penetrated Ymir's chest.

The battlefield where heaven's greatest demonic swordsman and warrior had clashed was devastated.

Wherever they had passed left sunken traces, and wind entered through the shattered windows.

Ymir was laughing while leaning against the wall. As the shock wave's Signal rushed in, his body was decomposing at the cellular level.

"Kekeke, not bad. How does it feel? The feeling of piercing me."

Ashur had a bitter taste in his mouth. Though Ymir had lost his body, he wasn't someone who would allow a single sword strike so easily.

"...Was it your 'part'?"

Ymir was a giant who had achieved the unprecedented wine of tales up to the 10th level. Only Ra knew how many bodies he had absorbed, but the accepted theory was that it easily exceeded ten thousand.

"Just because I'm a giant doesn't mean I can't use my head. Come slowly. I'll go ahead and wait."

As Ymir slowly collapsed, Ashur's sword emerged through his head.

Soon after, bubbles frothed from Ymir's body before it dissolved into black liquid.

Ashur glared at the liquid wetting his feet. Opening his palm, his sword transformed into Signal and disappeared.

"Damn, I was careless."

Ymir didn't like strategy. He considered it a fallback for the weak. But today alone, he had swallowed his pride and chose to go to the Great World Hall.

Animal instinct? No, it was superhuman instinct.

Ymir liked simple things, but he always beat complex ones. Because he was born with one particular trait.

The instinct to smell war.

Looking at heaven's history, Ymir was always at the core of war.

This time was the same.

He had intuited that the events happening in the Great World Hall would be the decisive opportunity to reclaim his body.

"I might be too late."

Though their dispositions were opposite, Ymir's sense of smell was trustworthy.

The fact that he had abandoned battle and disappeared meant there was no need to buy time. The situation at the Great World Hall was definitely turning more serious than expected.

Ashur kicked off the ground and left the battlefield.

"Canis! Fall back! You can't go any further!"

Arin shouted. It had already been 10 minutes since he entered the Objet's domain. Yet rather than retreating, Canis was increasing the speed of his magic barrage.

Baalb had moved away as if it wasn't worth responding. The two-horned Mara fundamentally surpassed Canis's abilities, but with the Objet present, there was no need to act directly.

The sleep Objet made living beings fall asleep, but what was more frightening was when they refused.

If one forced themselves to endure, the fatigue of sleep deprivation would accumulate and eventually lead to death.

Currently, Canis's mental state was equivalent to not sleeping for roughly 8 days.

"Not bad for a human. But how long will you endure? Death comes without proper sleep."

Canis regained consciousness.

He hadn't heard what Baalb had said moments before. The scenery his eyes saw wasn't being transmitted to his brain.

—Canis! Snap out of it!

Harvest shouted through the mental channel. But it was useless. As his mind began to go numb, not even a response came back.

"The master seems quite concerned. Well, since you share life, it's natural."

Harvest turned at Kariel's words. The archangel had currently descended to earth and was observing the situation. He had clearly seen through Harvest's weakened power.

"Maintaining darkness requires considerable energy. Are you replenishing that with human life? An interesting idea, but it only disperses power."

Canis slowly raised his body.

He had only just realized he had been lying down. He hadn't even been conscious of drool flowing from his mouth.

"Arin, it seems not everyone will return alive."

"No! Canis! That's absolutely not allowed!"

A terrible thought occurred to Arin.

If Canis, who resembled their master's personality, attempted something in this situation, it could only be the card Arcane had played on the brink of death.

Harvest reached the same conclusion.

—Canis, surely not Abyss Memory? But you're different from Arcane. You might not be able to endure it.

Canis shook his head. With just that level of resolve, he couldn't defeat the two-horned Mara.

—No. I'm going to try what we discussed before. I need your power, Harvest. Can you help me?

—You can't. That's magic that's only theoretically possible. We've never even experimented with it. You should at least try it after interpreting the Book of Light and Darkness.

—Harvest, if one of us must live, it should be Arin. You know that too.

Harvest didn't answer. But since he didn't deny it either, it was as good as acknowledging Canis's words. It also meant his own extinction.

—Understood. I'll give you my power.

Harvest's body was absorbed into Canis's shadow.

Canis, having regained some consciousness, prepared for death.

He had never particularly thought about dying in any specific situation. He would simply enter the eternal world of nothingness willingly.

"Limit of Abyss."

The magic he had only designed in theory activated.

Instantly, his mental fatigue disappeared. But unlike Arcane, he hadn't erased memories.

What he had erased was his limit.

Canis knew what kind of human he was. He probably couldn't reach the supreme realm like Shirone.

So he overcame his limits in his own way.

Children who don't know fire willingly stick their hands into flames, and high monks burn their own bodies to enter nirvana through self-immolation.

Though the difference between ignorance and sudden enlightenment is stark, the mental magnitude of throwing oneself into fire is the same.

If Canis couldn't become an enlightened monk, he chose to become an ignorant child.

The result was a temporary state of Immortal Function.

Of course, he hadn't actually reached nirvana. But at least in battle, he could obtain sufficiently similar mental power.

"I'm going!"

Until the duration of Limit of Abyss ended, he felt no fatigue. But the sight of Canis flying around energetically was hell for Arin.

"Canis! No! Please don't do this!"

Arin cried out in tears. Without Canis and Harvest, she didn't have the courage to live in the world.

But Canis couldn't hear anyone's voice. Feeling slight elation at successfully casting magic for the first time, he cast the greatest magic he could unleash.

'Servants of Darkness.'

Magic that converted a mage's mind into physical force. While Arcane's was a Dark Golem, Canis's servants took a completely different form.

Shadows spread across the floor like water, then a giant earthworm called a Worm erupted.

"Master..."

If he could obtain mental power equivalent to Immortal Function, Servants of Darkness was the most compatible magic.

'You'll praise me, won't you?'

A 10-meter-long earthworm drew a parabola and fell vertically.

Baalb wasn't tense. He simply moved away indifferently without unfolding his arms.

"Not bad. This time I'll give you praise..."

Before Baalb could finish speaking, another Dark Worm erupted from the floor.

A reverse waterfall swallowed Baalb whole and shot up to the ceiling.

The sound of the Objet cracking and Baalb's bones breaking could be heard. Soon after, Baalb's grotesquely twisted corpse fell down.
