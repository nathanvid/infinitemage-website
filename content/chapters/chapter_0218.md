Canis gasped for breath. His head was spinning so badly it felt like his brain was melting.

But he couldn't rest yet. He had to fight for Arin until the very last moment.

"Baalb, you're in quite a state."

At Kariel's voice, Baalb's body flinched.

"My apologies, Lord Kariel."

Canis's face went blank. He had definitely shattered every bone in that body - how could it still be alive?

No, it wasn't simply alive.

Each bodily organ was transforming into strange forms.

Insect legs covered in carapaces sprouted out, and tentacles resembling those of mollusks extended forth.

"Thank you for granting me demonic awakening."

As Baalb's bulk grew mountain-like in size, everyone had to crane their necks straight up.

It was a massive creature that was a chaotic mixture of all kinds of life forms.

The word "mixture" was perfectly apt.

It looked exactly like what you'd get if you threw octopus, cockroaches, flies, maggots, snakes and such into a cauldron, boiled them, then dried out the moisture.

"Kekeke! It's been two thousand years since I last awakened."

"Is this... the end?"

Canis's hope vanished like bubbles. The Objet was merely... Mara's plaything.

By the time he realized he had staked his life on an impossible task from the beginning, it was already too late.

"Rian, Rian..."

Phoebe looked back at Rian with tears welling in her eyes. Even in this situation where everything had turned to nothing, he was still fighting.

No, he was holding his ground.

Rian, who had coughed up blood from the first collision, was embracing Ymir in that state and applying a mental lock.

He would break before he would bend.

What he had gained as the price for choosing the dangerous path was physical abilities equivalent to Schema.

Realizing that Ymir couldn't be freed unless Rian's body was destroyed, he threw punch after punch upward.

Each time Rian's body shook from the impact, his greatsword swayed.

"Urgh! Not yet...!"

Seeing the situation like this, Ymir also had strange thoughts.

The quality of his strength was as hard as iron. It wasn't the kind of physical force a living being could produce. Moreover, having made a mess of his insides, it should have been impossible for him to exert any strength.

'Among humans, those who can use this are extremely rare.'

Through countless battles, he encountered such individuals at very low frequencies. But without exception, they were all the strongest warriors representing civilization.

It wouldn't be respectful to those warriors to put a human who couldn't even use giant techniques on the same level.

"Keke! Let's see how far you can go!"

Ymir threw an uppercut from ultra-close range.

The moment his abdominal muscles ruptured, Rian's eyes opened wide. His body that had been lifted landed and his knees bent, but he held on by clinging to Ymir.

In the next moment, Rian released the mental lock and pushed away from Ymir's shoulder.

As the clinch that seemed like it would never be released ended, Ymir made a puzzled expression.

But did it matter? He was the strongest anyway.

No matter what creature faced the King of Giants, this was how it always ended.

"Did you finally give up? For a human, you lasted quite long. As a reward, I'll end this without pain."

Ymir stepped forward with force and extended his fist. Even at close range, it was destructive power that tore through muscle, so if a strike loaded with body weight connected, Rian's body wouldn't be able to withstand it.

But Rian didn't care. He was smiling at Ymir, his eyes directed beyond the giant's shoulder.

"You're here, Shirone."

@

Shirone had covered a kilometer distance in thirty seconds.

As the Great World Hall drew near, he could see a giant throwing punches and Rian in terrible condition.

"Riaaaan!"

Ymir flinched. But the fist loaded with tremendous strength rushed toward Rian's abdomen, carried by inertia.

Shirone cast Shining Chain. Chains dozens of meters long wrapped tightly around Ymir's body.

"Huh?"

The moment Ymir realized it, his body was being dragged at tremendous speed.

"Graaaah!"

Even while floating, Ymir channeled power and attempted to destroy the chains.

The giant's brute force pressed against Shirone's mind. But he had no intention of accepting such a crude challenge.

Shirone moved the chains and slammed the giant down.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Ymir's body, wrapped in chains, traced parabolic trajectories as he was repeatedly smashed down. When he was finally driven into the ground, the floor rang with a resounding thud.

Ymir, sprawled spread-eagle, didn't move.

It was humiliation.

His body burned with rage at the fact that his flesh had been mocked by a mere human mage.

"Do you think I'd break just from being smashed into the ground? I'll shatter these chains right now! Feel how strong my body is!"

As Ymir inflated his muscles, the chains were pulled taut. Shirone's brow furrowed. But if the opponent came with a frontal assault, deflecting and counterattacking was what mages did.

"How about this?"

As Shirone swung his arm, the chains loosened and Ymir went flying outside the bridge.

Ymir looked at Shirone with a blank expression while floating in mid-air.

"You..."

Just as he was about to say something, his body affected by gravity fell below the bridge.

**Heaven (1)**

The falling Ymir looked up at the receding bridge. It was only when the scenery was obscured by clouds that he could escape his feeling of futility.

"Anyway, these mages..."

It wouldn't matter if he crashed into the ground like this. Rather than dawdling around in a 'partial' state, it would be much more fun to have an endurance contest with the ground waiting below.

That's what he thought.

But the moment the boy appeared, he caught the scent again. The fishy yet pungent smell unique to battlefields.

Nothing was over yet. The hottest place in Heaven was still the Great World Hall.

"I can't be absent from such a place."

He had to go to the Great World Hall.

If he attempted to leap, the power of being 'partial' would weaken further, but since the bloody scent of battle was calling, there was no need to hesitate.

"Hraaaah!"

Ymir inhaled air and inflated his body.

As oxygen was cut off, his skin hardened like porcelain. Color drained from his face and vitality left his eyes.

His lips parted and his pulse stopped.

Thus, Ymir died.

With a pop, the front of the corpse burst open and an identical Ymir popped out.

Ymir, riding the powerful propulsion, leaped dozens of meters and drove his fingers into a pillar supporting Jebul.

"Phew, it's annoying every time."

For one who pursued might, the weakening of power was unbearable frustration. Especially being born from partial to partial required going through death, which was extremely unpleasant.

The reason he endured all this humiliation was one: to witness the end of battle with his own eyes.

Ymir, hanging on the pillar, placed his soles against it and let his shoulders drop. The moment he pulled his arms while kicking off the pillar, his massive body soared upward against gravity.

*Life's wine progression 80 percent.*

Shirone looked around the Great World Hall. As he approached the entrance, Phoebe passed him all the memories up to that point.

Shirone looked down at the bleeding Rian.

"Are you okay? Sorry I'm late."

"No. You're not late. Go inside and rescue the girls."

Rian was a mess. To return home, he needed time to recover at least his stamina.

"Shirone!"

Amy shouted. The emotions she had been holding back exploded as tears formed in her eyes. She thought she was holding up well, but apparently she had been feeling sorry for herself without realizing it.

"There's no time! Once the information is transmitted, it's over!"

Shirone knew what her words meant. He was angry enough that his fingertips trembled.

Throughout all their time together, he had never thought that Amy needed his permission for anything.

But when this situation arose, he finally realized.

Without his permission, no one should dare treat Amy carelessly.

Canis rose from Shirone's shadow.

"How did it go? Did you find a way to escape? Is Ikael going to release the girls?"

"Ikael won't come."

"So it was all for nothing?"

"Maybe so. But from now on, I'll try."

Shirone walked toward Baalb. But the target he was glaring at was Kariel beyond him.

"If you release the girls even now, I'll just go back."

"What would be different even if that happened? Destruction cannot be avoided. The final war will occur and all humans can do is wait for death."

"No. You cannot destroy us."

"I don't know what basis you have for spouting such nonsense. Heaven's power is great. If Ra had not existed, your world would not have existed either."

"That may be so. But Ra is not a god."

It wasn't words spoken out of stubbornness, nor sophistry. Shirone truly believed this. And so did Miro.

*Shirone, gods aren't particularly great beings. They're simply the designers of the world.*

When he first heard those words from Miro, he didn't understand. He thought it was the words of an Unlocker who wielded Scale magic disparaging gods out of overconfidence in their abilities.

But now that he understood Heaven's secrets, it was different.

Miro had known - that beings who considered themselves great could not become gods.

There was only one god. The one who designed the world.

"Humans are not as foolish as you think. A being we can see, feel, and analyze cannot become a god! We will fight! If the final war occurs, it will be Heaven that perishes!"

Kariel's expression crumpled. It had probably been a long time since he heard such blasphemous words.

"This settles it. Humans deserve to die. Baalb, execute them."

"That would be my greatest pleasure, Lord Kariel."

Baalb's massive body began to writhe. Every time the huge form moved, nameless organs wriggled meaninglessly.

"Canis! Stand back!"

Countless photons rose around Shirone. The tension of vibrating light was so terrifying it seemed like it would burst out at the slightest touch.

Just as Baalb lunged at Shirone, dozens of Photon Cannons fired.

Pew pew pew pew pew BOOM!

Amazingly, Baalb's body was pushed back. Then an ear-splitting shriek burst forth.

The Photon Cannons endlessly pummeled the massive form.

Insect legs broke and the tentacles of mollusks lost their elasticity as if they had been chewed by molars.

Baalb's body was completely overturned. Even in that situation, he was beaten by the pouring cannons and pushed toward Kariel.

Only then did Shirone stop his magic. It was an attack where all his anger up to that point had exploded at once.

Even so, he wasn't tired. Despite the single-shot power having increased, he couldn't even feel fatigue.

Watching this, Canis felt futile. Was it possible for a human to raise their magic power by a level in just a few hours?

Realizing something new while risking one's life on the battlefield was something that happened quite often.

But Shirone hadn't undergone a mental change. All the values that comprised him had uniformly increased.

'This can't be. I can't fall this far behind.'

Just a few months ago when he had fought Shirone, the difference hadn't been that severe. Moreover, after losing to light magic, he had trained harder than anyone to surpass Shirone.

But Shirone was much further away than before.

Why didn't he feel frustrated? What exactly was the source of power that comprised him?

Kariel spoke to the fallen Baalb.

"Stop playing around, Baalb."

His expression showed not the slightest waver. Of course, Shirone's magic was certainly decent for a human. By divine subjects' standards, it would easily fall within the top 40 percent.

But that wasn't enough to defeat a two-horned Mara.

According to the laws, even ten Shirones would be insufficient against Mara's might.

"My apologies, Lord Kariel. It seems the Great World Hall will be somewhat destroyed."

"Permission granted."

As Kariel gave his consent, the floor began to shake. The organs of countless creatures comprising Baalb all turned toward the ceiling at once and began to struggle.

"Kekeke! To wake my cute test subjects from their sleep. This will become a nightmare for you."
