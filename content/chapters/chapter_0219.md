Baalb, known as the god of anesthesia in certain civilizations, was a Mara who put all living creatures to sleep and implanted them into his own organs.

Sleep reduces living beings to the status of inanimate objects.

Creatures caught by Baalb were no different from objects, forced to live their entire lives as organs of the monster.

*Wine of tales progress: 90 percent.*

Baalb, weighing over 100 tons, flailed his sluggish body as he pursued Shirone. Something like the front legs of a quadruped protruded from his shoulders and struck the floor with tremendous force.

The Great World Hall resonated with thunderous echoes.

"Kiki! How's that? The power of 260 lions combined. Soon you'll all become part of my body too."

*Wine of tales progress: 91 percent.*

Once it passed 90 percent, the voice announced each single percent increment. Shirone's heart sank at the fact that only 9 percent remained.

"...rone! Shirone!"

Canis's call snapped him back to attention.

"Where's your mind wandering? If you've prepared something, do it quickly. Don't tell me you charged in here without any plan?"

If Shirone had come running just because his magic had improved a little, Canis was ready to cast Dark Worm on himself.

He'd rather die than become part of a sleep demon and suffer eternally.

Hearing Canis's words, Shirone recalled the magic circle Ikael had given him.

But even if he could create a halo, he couldn't utilize it as instantly as an angel would.

"I do have one thing..."

"Then do it! Why are you hesitating!"

Twenty crab legs sprouted from Baalb's lower body.

As the rapidly moving legs pushed the 100-ton mass forward, both Shirone and Canis simultaneously dove to the side.

Baalb leaped 10 meters high and crushed the spot where they had been standing.

The Great World Hall shook, and iron dust fell from the ceiling.

"I need time. Can you hold him off for a moment?"

Canis sighed. So that's how it was after all?

But how long could he hold back a two-horned Mara that was difficult to face even with a clear mind?

"Ten seconds. I absolutely can't last longer than that."

"Please, just one minute."

The moment Shirone left his position, Baalb swung octopus-like tentacles. As Canis threw his body like a flying squirrel, the slimy tentacles shattered the floor.

"Kihehehe! You're excellent at running away. Well, that's the only advantage weaklings have."

"Hmph! Acting so arrogant when you're so sluggish."

Canis steeled his mind and calculated the time. Though the difference in power was extreme, if he focused solely on evasion, it wasn't entirely impossible. Just because a mosquito can't defeat a human doesn't mean it can't evade for one minute, right?

Rian gripped his greatsword and stood up.

"I have to... go."

He couldn't rest forever. Since Shirone was preparing something, he had to help Canis buy time.

Just then, Phoebe looked outside and shouted.

"That... that thing!"

When Rian turned around, he saw Ymir, the Giant King, charging with eyes burning with fury. He was clearly targeting Shirone, who had humiliated him.

Dragging his broken body, Rian gave everything he had in a tackle, causing Ymir's body to be pushed sideways. Rolling across the floor, Rian gripped his greatsword and blocked the path to Shirone.

'What? Why?'

He had risked his life in the attack, but he honestly hadn't expected Ymir to be pushed back. It felt like his strength had weakened compared to before.

Ymir brushed off his knees and stood up.

"The third time. But this won't be very interesting anymore, will it?"

"I am Shirone's sword. You absolutely cannot approach until I die."

Thanks to Phoebe's telepathy, they could now understand each other's words. But Ymir wrinkled his brow with a rather disappointed expression.

"You're wrong. Strength doesn't exist to protect something. The essence of strength is destruction. You who don't realize this will never be able to stop me."

Ymir moved like the wind. Though his raw power had decreased, his agility seemed to have increased instead.

A barrage of strikes like a downpour hammered Rian's body. Since Rian was already broken beyond repair, he couldn't even counterattack.

But he could be satisfied with this. As long as he was alive, Ymir would never reach Shirone.

'Hold on. Just hold on a little longer and I'll be able to die in peace.'

Ymir's eyes gradually began to redden. No matter how much he pounded, Rian wouldn't fall. He had destroyed everything visible, yet Rian kept enduring as if something still remained.

"Rian! Rian! Stop it, you bastard!"

Tess screamed with a face covered in tears.

"Please stop hitting him! He'll die at this rate!"

Ymir's attacks didn't stop. This was a different kind of madness from what he felt in ordinary combat.

The sensation of life clashing against life was transmitted through his skin.

Interesting. This was a very interesting human.

"Magnificent! Destroying you is my mission!"

Rian's body shook with tearing sounds.

Tess closed her eyes. But she could still see it. Rian's dying was being transmitted through all five senses.

She cried out to Kariel through her tears.

"Fine! I'll bear them! If it's Nephilim you want, I'll bear as many as you want, so please stop!"

Kariel was unmoved.

"Bearing Nephilim is natural. And I don't control Ymir."

*Wine of life progress: 96 percent.*

Ymir stopped his attacks and gasped for breath. It was shocking. What exactly was this human made of?

He was dead. No, he should have been dead by all rights.

Standing there without even being able to raise his guard, no sign of life could be found in him.

But he still gripped his greatsword.

How was this possible? He had completely pulverized all the muscles in the right arm. It was impossible to hold iron with just tendon strength.

'No, he's just a corpse. He's simply frozen in that position.'

Though he had clearly won, he didn't feel victorious.

"I'll finish you!"

Ymir ground his teeth. Taking a wide stride with the intention of delivering the final blow, he raised his fist.

At that moment, he saw Rian's greatsword rising. Very slowly at that. When he widened his field of vision, only Rian was moving in the entire Great World Hall.

'Damn! This again?'

Ymir, having experienced countless wars, called this the seesaw of time. When the world's speed suddenly soared, from the receiving perspective, time appeared to flow slowly.

As one side speeds up, the other slows down.

Conversely, this meant that Rian's arm was moving as fast as Ymir's time was flowing slowly.

'Damn it!'

Ymir realized why the boy standing before him could move even with his body shattered.

His mind hadn't been destroyed. That unbroken mind was directly controlling his body.

A technique that completely transcended the biological mechanism where the mind gives commands and the body follows.

This was Avatar Technique, possible only for the highest-level giants.

Since Schema originally came from giant arts, Avatar Technique also had similarities to certain concepts in the human world.

Swordsmen who strengthen their brains through Schema control their bodies through mental locks.

But when this goes beyond limits, mind and body integrate into one, causing the body to follow thought directly.

In the human realm, this phenomenon was called 'Divine Transcendence.'

'Heh. It would have been better if you'd done this from the start.'

Ymir watched Rian's greatsword pointing toward the ceiling and twisted his body.

The moment he thought he had leaned enough to evade, time's speed suddenly returned to normal.

Rian's greatsword disappeared from view. Simultaneously, his severed right arm spun through the air.

Ymir's face turned bitter. The faster Rian moved, the slower time flowed. Yet he couldn't dodge completely, which meant it was impossible to avoid from the beginning.

*Papapapapapang!*

The moment the greatsword touched the ground, Rian's right arm exploded. Torn muscles hung in tatters and all the bones were exposed.

His body couldn't withstand the speed of Divine Transcendence.

*Wine of life progress: 97 percent.*

The wine of life was now rushing toward its end. And the humans' lives were also fading. Canis, struck by Baalb's tentacle, flew dozens of meters and crashed into the wall.

And he couldn't get up.

"Baalb, finish it now."

"Yes, Lord Kariel!"

Having dealt with Canis, Baalb charged at Shirone. The promised one minute had already passed. But still no changes were occurring in Shirone.

"Shirone! Danger!"

Shirone couldn't hear anything. With Immortal Function opened to its limits in the reversal process, there was no room for nerves to intervene.

"Kuhahahaha! I'll hang you in my most hideous place!"

Something like a scorpion's tail sprouted from Baalb's back. A black droplet hung from the tip of the stinger.

It was a powerful sleep toxin that could anesthetize even a dragon with just one sting.

At that moment, Shirone's eyes snapped open. *Pwong!* A circle with a 2-meter diameter was born, and Baalb's attack bounced off the shockwave.

Watching this, a puzzled light crossed Kariel's face.

'Could it be? No, that's impossible.'

Humans couldn't use angelic abilities. It wasn't something the human mind could comprehend.

But why this unease? What was this base feeling of anxiety?

"Baalb! There's no time!"

"Kieeeeeee!"

Hearing Kariel's command, Baalb screamed and launched a body attack. His hideous face was frozen in terror.

As Shirone's halo spun at light speed, a red dot embedded in its center. Then the first magic circle began calling forth countless concepts.

An angel's magic circle.

Infinite Photon Cannon Halo.

Kariel couldn't hide his shock as he examined the numerous magic circles blooming like lotus flowers from the halo.

It really was a Halo.

It made no sense for a human to realize this on their own. Someone had definitely taught it to him.

But who? Where in this Heaven was there a mad angel who would teach Halo to a human?

While Kariel couldn't escape his shock, Phoebe flew to the women.

"Quick! Quick!"

"Got it! Just wait a moment!"

Applying spiral force, the handcuffs twisted.

Thanks to Canis having cut more than half through them, Phoebe's ability could destroy the handcuffs without much difficulty.

Even during this, Kariel couldn't take his eyes off the Halo.

What was happening before his eyes was a more serious problem than Nephilim.

An angel's betrayal was a grave matter that shook Heaven's very foundation.

He had to know. Who had taught this?

And that existence had to be eliminated.

Baalb mobilized every organ to crush Shirone. But as if blocked by an invisible barrier, his attacks stopped before reaching the body.

"Kiek! Kiek!"

He gave everything he had, but it was an irresistible force. Just as a child cannot kill its mother, the authority of a higher existence recorded in law was blocking access itself.

As brilliantly colored flashes struck the Halo, countless magic circles were born and meshed like gears.

The moment information density exceeded 80 percent, concepts rapidly changed and rotation speed increased.

The halo's rotation speed, beyond imagination, felt as if it alone could tear the world apart.

Realizing the concepts contained in the magic circles, Baalb's face turned deathly pale. His legs gave out and he fell backward with a thud.

He had encountered what Mara feared most.

"Hiiek! Atara...! Atara...!"

Baalb mobilized every organ he could move to crawl toward Kariel. But he was so shocked that not a single organ was properly pushing against the ground.

Having given up on survival, Baalb turned around and shouted.

"Lord Kariel! Please escape! It's the Super Magic Amplification Circle Ataraxia!"

Kariel knew. But he didn't move. All kinds of thoughts filled his head so completely that time itself seemed to stop flowing.

Ataraxia.

Heaven's strongest photon magic that had subdued countless angels. Ikael's exclusive technique that could make any Mara scream.

She had passed such an ability to a human?

It couldn't be.

It would be more plausible if his eyes were deceiving him and Ikael standing there just appeared to be in the form of a boy.

'Ikael, have you really... gone mad?'

No, she hadn't gone mad.

She was truly planning to stop the war. She had decided to side with humans, even abandoning the honor of being the strongest angel.

*Information transmission rate: 98 percent.*

Kariel's body trembled. Only 2 percent remained. But Ataraxia was waiting.

He could see Shirone's gaze targeting him. Could a human really use this?

It might be a deception. The wine of life had to continue. But if the current situation was reality...

He would be annihilated.

"Ikaeeeeeeel!"

As Kariel roared in fury, Shirone's Photon Cannon fired simultaneously.
