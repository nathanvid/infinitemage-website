KWAAA-KWAAA-KWAAA-KWAAA-KWAAA-KWAAA-KWAAA-KWAAA!

Flash erupted from Ataraxia.

Shirone couldn't control the output. As the distance increased, the flash spread and filled the Great World Hall with light.

Baalb flailed dozens of arms and legs as he crawled across the floor, but was immediately swept away by the torrent of light and vanished without a trace.

Objects in the path of the racing flash were swept away. It seemed as if even space itself was being pushed aside.

WHEEEEEEEEEENG!

The Great World Hall located at the edge of Jebul.

The massive dome's barriers exploded, and two streaks of flash of immeasurable size split the heavens.

"Huff! Huff!"

Shirone fell to his knees, gasping for breath. Seeing the scene spread before his eyes, his legs gave out.

Half of the Great World Hall had been blown away. Even having done it himself, he couldn't believe the result.

What on earth had Ikael been thinking when she carved this into his mind?

Only Kariel remained in Shirone's field of vision.

The sky was visible behind him, and the ground was carved into a massive Y-shape.

The halo spread above Kariel's head was rotating at tremendous speed.

—Wine of life... progress... 99... percent.

Shirone hurriedly turned around.

Amy was struggling desperately to tear off the panel stuck to her forehead. But no matter how much she scratched until she bled, it showed no signs of coming off.

Just as he was about to fall into despair, the voice came again.

—Transmission canceled. Wine of life... halted.

The panel embedded in Amy's forehead slipped out smoothly and decomposed into particles smaller than dust.

Shirone let out a sigh of relief and looked back at Kariel.

The seraph's face was twisted terribly. Though there was a time delay in the guidance voice, it was clear that he had regained his power the moment Ataraxia was activated.

For Kariel, it had been an unavoidable choice.

Even if he had proceeded with the wine of life, the result would have been the same. Ataraxia's amplification power was not at a level that could be blocked while mental strength was being drained by the wine of life.

Kariel spread his massive golden wings and soared up.

"Now do you understand, foolish human? This is the wine of life. Life is something that even I, a seraph, can only create by abandoning everything and dedicating myself completely!"

Kariel looked down at the devastated Great World Hall.

It was merely magic cast by a youngster. Yet it had this level of destructive power.

Why should such power be given to humans?

Humans cannot control themselves. Even the most virtuous person will inevitably fall to corruption before the temptation of power.

That boy will try to become a king. He will rule the world with angelic abilities and indulge in all manner of pleasures.

'That would be fine too.'

Wouldn't it be better to just send him back like this?

Then the human world would self-destruct without any need for a final war.

But that wasn't possible. Ikael couldn't be unaware of what he was thinking.

Then why on earth? Had she really gone insane?

How could anyone in their right mind think of teaching angelic law to a human?

'Does she trust him that much? That boy?'

What had Ikael seen in that human?

Of course, he acknowledged the talent. Without any talent, it would be impossible to accept angelic law.

But that alone wasn't enough explanation. There was definitely something he didn't know.

Then he had to capture him now. If he let him escape, a powerful weapon that could threaten Heaven would fall into human hands.

"Don't beg me for mercy anymore."

Kariel declared war, but Shirone's group, who were thinking of escape, didn't even have the luxury to listen.

Arin had brought Canis, and Amy was protecting Phoebe.

Tess also ran to bring Rian. But Ymir was still guarding that spot.

Ymir, who had been looking indifferently at Tess's murderous eyes, turned his gaze to Rian kneeling on his knees.

Rian's face, tilted up toward the ceiling, was not that of a living person.

His right hand had only bone left, but he was still gripping his greatsword.

It was the terror of Avatar Technique, where mind and body had unified.

"One win, one draw, one loss. Shall we call today a draw?"

"......"

"Heh, being this weak. When you fight the main body, will even bones remain?"

Ymir lifted his severed right arm. When he shoved it into Rian's mouth, it dissolved into black liquid and flowed down his throat.

"Take him. And cherish him. If he survives, he might be able to save humanity. Then it would be an interesting war for me too."

As Rian, thrown by Ymir, slid across the floor, Tess hurriedly caught him.

Tears welled up when she saw the arm with only bones remaining, but first she had to return home to treat him.

A drone flew over and attached to Tess's arm as a gauntlet.

She gave Ymir one last glare before turning and running toward Arin.

Ymir, melting from his legs up, smiled good-naturedly.

He hoped Rian would survive. Humans needed to become stronger. Strong enough to force the revival of the Giant King.

Destroying strengthened humans was his destiny.

'The day will come when we fight again. Until then, I'll get some sleep.'

Ymir dissolved into black liquid. There were no more 'parts' remaining in Heaven. He would fall into a long sleep in eternally unfrozen ice, waiting for the final war that would someday come.

—Shirone, we're ready!

Arin's voice entered Shirone's mind. He wanted to escape immediately, but the Metagate operated for 30 seconds. The timing of escape would determine life and death.

Shirone knew it was impossible for everyone to escape with Kariel, now in perfect condition.

The only way was for at least one person to stay behind and buy time for friends to evacuate.

—Arin. Open the Metagate now. And get out no matter what.

—What about you?

—I'll stop Kariel. If I can delay his approach by just one second, it'll be enough for you to get out.

—But Shirone! None of us can do such a thing...!

—Please. Make sure Amy gets home safely.

It was asking her to keep it secret. If Amy knew Shirone was staying behind, she would never try to leave this place.

Arin couldn't refuse Shirone's proposal. Someone had to live, even through someone else's sacrifice.

Just as Canis had done, just as Rian had done, Shirone was simply making a choice to save someone precious.

—Alright, Shirone. Signal me when you're ready.

Shirone prepared his mind.

What would happen to him? His friends wouldn't come to Heaven to rescue someone whose life or death was unknown.

If he died immediately, that would be fine, but he might be captured by Kariel and subjected to all kinds of experiments.

He was afraid.

Everyone would leave and only he would remain.

'I'm sorry, Headmaster. You were right.'

A bitter smile crossed Shirone's lips. But soon he glared at Kariel with fierce eyes.

He had to charge. The time it took to open and enter the Metagate was one second. He just had to draw Kariel's attention for one second somehow.

By now, Arin must have explained the operation to his friends. They would never dream that he was staying here.

Shirone took a deep breath.

It was the moment of farewell.

—Arin! Now!

As Arin opened the Metagate, Shirone simultaneously rushed at Kariel.

Amy turned around with surprised eyes.

'Why? Shirone?'

This was different from the operation she'd heard. Hadn't they said they would all throw themselves in simultaneously and leave the result to luck?

Amy, who instantly understood the situation from Arin's sad expression, burst into tears and reached out her hand.

"No! Shirone...!"

Arin wrapped her arms around Amy's waist and leaped into the Metagate's portal. Tess, holding Canis and Rian, also threw herself into the portal and squeezed her eyes shut.

'Shirone, please... let us meet again.'

Shirone lifted his head and caught tears in his eyes. His expression mixed joy and sorrow.

It was fortunate that Kariel wasn't paying attention to his friends' situation. Perhaps he had been targeting only him from the beginning. If so, he felt rather relieved.

If he could save his friends, he would gladly be captured.

—Don't do that, Shirone.

At the sudden mental resonance, he looked to the side. Phoebe was flying alongside him with a smile in her eyes.

—Phoebe, why are you still here?

Phoebe's thoughts penetrated rapidly.

—Humans are a strange species. They choose their own lives. For that, they can willingly accept even death.

—What are you talking about all of a sudden?

Shirone became anxiously worried. He felt that something he didn't know was happening.

It was entirely possible. Perhaps the reason Arin had agreed to the operation was...

'No, that can't be. It shouldn't be.'

This little fairy had helped them. Even if he was left alone in Heaven, the reason he didn't feel like he'd fallen to the depths was because Phoebe would be there beside him.

—Extinction is a frightening thing. But watching you all, I thought. Humans who can throw away their lives for those they love. To me, that seemed truly wonderful.

—Phoebe, no.

—Go back to your friends. And...

Tears formed in Phoebe's eyes.

—I love you, Shirone.

Phoebe cut off mental contact and rushed toward Kariel.

Shirone stared blankly at her receding figure. A moment later, his legs stopped regardless of his will, and his body turned toward the Metagate.

"Ugh! Sob!"

Shirone ran toward the Metagate. Tears blocked his vision so he couldn't see anything.

The world looked blurry, as if submerged in water. Before this miraculous opportunity, he was endlessly weak.

He could return. He could go back to his original world and meet everyone again.

'Mom, Dad, I'm coming. I'll definitely go back and...'

Shirone stopped abruptly. Different hearts were fighting with equal weight, but the thought that came to mind was one promise he had made with Phoebe.

—If I get captured, will you come rescue me? I mean... if we're friends.

—Of course.

"Of course... Phoebe."

Shirone clenched his fists through his tears. And with his last remaining mental strength, he cast Teleportation.

Her words saying she loved him echoed like a hallucination.

To a one-year-old fairy, love was such an enormous concept. Not romantic love, not love between friends, not parental love, but simply unique love.

Phoebe was a fairy with a pure and clear soul.

Returning home while abandoning such a friend was pain harder to bear than death.

'Phoebe! Please! Please wait!'

Phoebe, facing death, was terrified. Was this extinction? Everything was just scary and unfamiliar.

Every moment, an unknown world unfolded and her heart swung between extremes accordingly.

Had it been the right choice? Had what she told Arin been completely sincere?

—I'm Phoebe. If someone has to stay, everyone leave. I'll stop Kariel.

—But... what about you?

—I can't leave Heaven anyway. Besides, this is something I, as a divine subject's internal affairs officer, should do.

Phoebe forced a smile.

'It's okay. I'm a spiral fairy. No matter how much I shake, I'm moving straight forward.'

She couldn't meet Igirin, who had finally acknowledged her true worth, but she was satisfied because she realized it at the end of her life.

The wine of tales wasn't what was great. What was truly great was the sacrifice of humans who willingly accepted the wine of tales.

She was glad Shirone could live.

"Insolent fairy."

Kariel snorted and extended his hand. With his ability, he could instantly extinguish a mere fairy.

Sensing death, Phoebe's lips turned down. She finally burst into tears.

But she didn't back down. She stretched out both hands and shot the power of the spiral with all her might.

"Phoebe! Stop!"

At Shirone's unexpected voice, Phoebe turned around. At that moment, Kariel swept past. The angel's slender hand came for Shirone's neck.

'I won't let you go. Not you!'

He would research him. Using any cruel method, he would dissect and make Ataraxia's mechanism his own.

CLAAANG!

At that moment, a purple longsword pierced between Kariel's fingers. A black-haired man was already blocking Shirone's path.

It was Ashur, the triangular mara under Ikael.

"Ashur... are you going to interfere with me too?"

"This is a message from Lady Ikael."

Anger filled Kariel's eyes.

How dare a mere triangular mara suddenly announce business. Did he still think Ikael ruled Heaven?

Of course, he had once respected Ikael. But she had committed something that should never be done.

"That shame of Heaven is sending me messages?"

"Choose your words carefully."

"It's not wrong. A noble angel who rose to seraph took the seed of a lowly human..."

"Ka-ri-el!"

Ashur glared like a demon.

"I clearly said this was Lady Ikael's message."

Kariel closed his mouth. It was Ikael's message.

"She said that if you harm this boy, she cannot regard you with good feelings."

Kariel's nose bridge wrinkled. He couldn't understand her psychology at all.

Ikael had become ugly. She had fallen.

But he still thought of her as Ikael. It was the last regret remaining for the angel he had admired.

But to stab him in the back like this.

Why was she, who had risen to the head of angels, devoting such care to a mere human?

Kariel had no choice but to maintain his pride through silence. Then Ashur looked back at Shirone and spoke.

"Go. Phoebe will be safe. I promise in Lady Ikael's name."

Shirone, who had exhausted all mental strength with Teleportation, wasn't in a state to move. But as Ashur's words flowed in, a faint smile spread across his face.

If it was Ikael, he could trust her. She was the one who had given him everything.

"Farewell, Shirone."

Phoebe, activating the power of the spiral, sent Shirone flying toward the Metagate as she spoke. And that was the last thing Shirone heard in Heaven.
