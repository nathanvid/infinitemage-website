Kergo Autonomous District.

The room where Shirone's group had stayed was neatly tidied up.

A black sphere materialized in the space filled with quiet air. The sphere looked like a two-dimensional hole, and five people were expelled from it.

Amy, who had rolled across the floor, crawled toward the portal and called for Shirone. She couldn't believe the fact that he wasn't coming back.

Tess and Arin grabbed her as she tried to enter the portal.

Amy even hated the two people who were stopping her. They shouldn't have left Shirone behind and come back.

"Let go! Everyone move! I'm going to save Shirone!"

"Amy! If you go in, you won't be able to come back! We have to wait now!"

"Wait for what? You all left Shirone in a life-or-death situation!"

"No! Phoebe..."

Arin stopped speaking and looked at the portal. From the other side of space, Shirone was flying toward them, spinning.

Tears welled up in Amy's eyes.

She spread her arms wide to catch Shirone and rolled across the floor from the spiral force. She was so happy that she couldn't even feel the pain.

Arin watched the Metagate portal disappear and thought of the one fairy who remained in heaven.

'Thank you, Phoebe.'

The place where the portal opened was the room provided by the Kergo chief.

Heaven was a distant place, but since they had traveled through Guffin's door, no time relativity occurred. Calculating the solar calendar differences, it seemed about three days had passed.

"Rian! Rian..."

Tess's tears fell on Rian's face. He had returned alive, but she wasn't happy. The one who used to say like a habit that he would become the world's greatest swordsman had lost his arm.

Rian's right arm was nothing but bone. He tried to draw his greatsword, but his fingers wouldn't extend.

Tess was stunned. With no muscles and even the ligaments severed and dangling, how was he holding onto his sword?

At that moment, the door burst open and a Kergo person entered.

After blankly watching the women embracing their partners and sending wary glances, he ran toward the exit and shouted.

"They've returned! They've returned!"

Arin read hostility from the Kergo person's initial response. Amy, who instinctively realized this wasn't the time to just cry, asked.

"Arin, what's wrong?"

"I don't know. But I think we should leave quickly. Those definitely weren't friendly feelings."

Amy's group left the room with the injured. The cave structure was complex, but no one failed to remember the exit.

The problem was that it was one-way.

Footsteps echoed from the depths of the cave, and dozens of warriors blocked the exit.

"Where are you trying to run, you traitors!"

Arin interpreted the language through mental resonance.

"The crime of humiliating Kergo cannot be repaid even with death! We'll strip your flesh for three days and three nights and let you dry to death under the sun!"

Even through translation, the language was chilling.

Amy couldn't understand the situation. They hadn't fulfilled Kadum's request, but it hadn't been a contract from the beginning.

Among the warriors, she could see a familiar old man. His face was deeply wrinkled, and masses of muscle that hadn't fully atrophied yet hung loosely.

"You... surely not?"

"These damned bastards!"

It was the voice of Kergo Chief Kadum.

Was it possible to age so much in just a few days? Perhaps decades had passed while they were in heaven.

"How dare you insignificant things try to destroy Kergo! Return my lifespan!"

"We don't know anything about that! Why did you end up like this?"

"Nonsense! If you didn't pull some trick, why would my lifespan have shortened? I could have lived another 60 years!"

Arin suddenly realized.

'Canis...'

Even if all the men had the opportunity to manipulate the lifespan book, Canis was the only one who would make such a choice.

She supported his decision. Compared to what Kadum had done to his tribespeople, this was rather lenient.

But Canis probably hadn't known the situation would turn out like this.

As the warriors approached, emitting powerful auras, Amy entered the Spirit Zone with an instinct-like sensation.

She looked for Mahatu but couldn't see him.

If the anti-angel faction had been purged, this place was essentially an enemy stronghold. There was no one to help them.

"Capture them alive! I'll give those bastards a horrible death!"

The Kergo warriors approached with their weapons drawn. Each individual's martial prowess was impressive, but the collective fighting spirit was suffocating.

'What should I do? Should I block the passage with Fire Wall? But it's dangerous in a cave.'

Just as five giants were about to charge forward with their spears, a commotion was heard from the exit side.

Terrified Kadum turned around and shouted.

"What's happening! What's happening!"

It seemed his spirit had broken along with his physical aging.

Before long, the warriors guarding the rear were thrown toward Amy's group.

"Are you alright?"

Amy's face went blank.

Mahatu, whom she thought had been captured, was standing there. Most surprising were the people he had brought with him.

Jis, who had parted ways after finishing translation work, was standing there under the escort of the Parrot Mercenary Corps, along with Captain Marsha and Vice-Captain Freeman.

"Jis? Why are you here?"

"No time! Quickly come this way!"

Before Jis could finish speaking, the Kergo warriors charged.

From their perspective, they absolutely had to capture Shirone's group.

A civil war had already broken out in the Kergo autonomous zone.

The residents had joined the anti-angel faction, and if things were settled this way, the angel faction couldn't avoid downfall.

"Freeman! Go bring the kids!"

Marsha kicked Freeman's buttocks to push him forward.

Freeman, who hadn't taken the Reverse Technique Tree, boasted swift movements.

The warriors' spears and swords couldn't cut even a hair of his. It was a gunner's schema that abandoned regenerative power and focused on speed.

Thuk! Thuk! Thuk!

As Freeman entered the heart of the enemy formation and fired his gun in all directions, warriors were slammed into the cave walls. Before long, only Freeman remained in place, and thick gunpowder smoke from magic bullets filled the surroundings.

Amy wondered if this was really the same man she had fought against. When he changed schemas, his entire combat style had completely changed.

"Let's go. We can't hold out long."

"Ah, yes!"

Amy's group followed the Parrot Mercenary Corps and left the scene.

Kadum's warriors pursued them, but their numbers weren't threatening.

The dictator who had ruled Kergo for hundreds of years had lost all his power along with his physical aging.

"No! Don't go! I don't want to die like this! Please return my lifespan!"

Kadum's desperate cry echoed through the cave.

While leaving Mount Toa, Shirone's group was able to hear the whole story from Mahatu.

When Kadum's body aged, the priests declared martial law and imprisoned the anti-angel faction.

The person who rescued them was Jis.

Having arrived at the autonomous district to pay off Falcoa's medical bills, he sensed the uneasy atmosphere and began investigating.

That's when he realized Mahatu had been imprisoned and arrived here leading the Parrot Bandit Corps.

"Thank you, Jis. If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have survived."

At Amy's praise, Jis's face turned red.

"This much is nothing. It's nothing compared to what you all helped me with. By the way, are you okay? Why are only the men in this condition?"

Amy checked on Shirone's condition. He still showed no signs of waking up.

"Things turned out that way. Can we find a doctor on the island? Or should we go to the magic guild?"

Marsha looked over the injured. While Shirone and Canis had only lost consciousness, Rian's condition was serious.

All the flesh on his right arm had been stripped away. With such wounds, he should have died from excessive bleeding, but somehow no blood was flowing.

"Why does Rian look like this? No, more than that, how did you treat it? Is it really okay to leave him like this?"

Tess said tearfully.

"I don't know. He ate a giant's arm, and I think it might be because of that. As long as he's alive, I'll fix it no matter what it takes."

"Giant? Ate an arm? What are you talking about?"

Tess could only shake her head.

When they reached the entrance of Mount Toa, the Parrot Bandit Corps's carriage was waiting.

Mahatu bowed his head to convey his guilty feelings.

"The chief's immorality has put God's messenger in danger. Please forgive us."

The anti-angel faction was a faction created to oppose those who used God's name to satisfy their private greed.

From heaven's perspective, it was heretical and a way of thinking that could trigger the final war, but Amy couldn't blame Mahatu.

"I guess some troublemaker among our companions found Kadum disagreeable. We're rather sorry. It turned out well, but we almost paid a heavy price."

"It was something that had to happen once. If Kadum had remained strong, overthrowing the system would have involved much more sacrifice. Thank you."

Amy waited for other words from Mahatu.

But he didn't ask anything of the person who had visited heaven. He had chosen independence.

Amy boarded the carriage. Just as the tribal people's happiness came first for Mahatu, her friends' safety came first for her.

Mahatu didn't move until Amy's group disappeared beyond the horizon.

"Quickly! Quickly!"

Marsha had scoured Galliant Island to find one doctor and four healing mages, who entered Jis's house.

The doctor who examined Rian's condition was horrified.

He prayed that this boy hadn't endured such torture while conscious.

"This, this..."

Tess clung to him, crying and pleading.

"Doctor! Please heal him! You can fix it, right?"

The doctor closed his mouth like a mute. What exactly was he supposed to do? Healing meant restoring something that was broken. He couldn't create something new that had completely disappeared.

"There's no choice. I'm not an outstanding doctor, but anyone else would say the same thing. If we don't amputate, he might die."

"Amputate? This child is a swordsman! He was going to become the world's strongest swordsman!"

"We have to cut from below the shoulder. Unless he wants to become the world's strongest corpse."

Tess collapsed to her knees weakly. The doctor was right. When he regained consciousness and saw his arm reduced to bone, no one would remain mentally sound. Blood wasn't flowing yet, but no one knew when bleeding might resume.

"Ugh! This is... no joke."

The healing mages were working in pairs, casting recovery magic on Shirone and Canis.

They were casting Healing to boost biological functions and Purify to clear the mind, but it felt like pouring water into a bottomless jar.

"What on earth happened? Who are these children? In all my life, I've never seen people who don't wake up even after this much treatment."

Amy said.

"They're magic school students, so it'll be harder than with other people."

"Ugh! If we continue for more than 10 minutes, we need to rest for an hour. We've already exceeded the limit!"

"Please just endure 10 more minutes! I'll pay you however much you want."

"At this age, forget the money, just go on one date with me. You look exactly like my first love."

Amy's eyes widened, then she quickly nodded.

"Yes? Alright! I'll do it, so please try a little harder."

"...Don't make an old man's wit seem crude. Anyway, they must be precious people. I'll do what I can."

"Thank you! Thank you!"

As Amy repeatedly expressed her gratitude, the mage casting Purify clicked his tongue and scolded his colleague.

"You, making such harsh jokes."

"Who knew it would turn out like this?"

"No, I clearly remember your first love was the ugliest of the ugly."

The two old men burst into laughter. As unofficial 9th-grade mages who had never seen the light their whole lives, it felt like their blood was boiling after a long time.

"Shall we go full power for once?"

As they amplified their recovery magic, Shirone's body glowed brightly.

The mages on Canis's side, feeling competitive, strengthened their magic even more to not be outdone.

The doctor, having finished surgical preparations, gave instructions to Tess.

"Now, lay him down here. There will be a lot of bleeding, so prepare plenty of towels."

Tess moved Rian's body to the center of the bed, crying and sniffling. The doctor then took out a menacing-looking saw from his bag.

Since he was unconscious, there was no need for anesthesia. Even if he were awake, the pain wouldn't be bearable with just local anesthesia.
