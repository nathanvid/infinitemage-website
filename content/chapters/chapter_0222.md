"I'll finish as quickly as possible. Don't worry. I did take surgery classes once."

Surgery, which performs surgical operations, uses Schema differently from general medicine. Since the physician could also use basic Schema, he could cut through bone quickly.

"I'll begin now. He might have convulsions, so hold his body down tight."

Tess nodded while sobbing uncontrollably. Amy and Arin, who were watching, couldn't say anything to comfort her.

If they had been asked to choose, they would have run away. It was because it was Tess that this decision was made with the resolve to take responsibility for Rian's life forever.

"Huff! Huff! Then I'll start now!"

"Stop."

At the voice heard just as the saw touched his shoulder, the physician jumped in surprise and turned around.

Shirone, who had regained consciousness, was getting down from the bed. The exhausted healing mages lay sprawled on the floor, gasping for breath.

"Tess, what are you doing? Why are you trying to cut off Rian's arm?"

"Shirone, Shirone..."

Tess burst into tears. Unable to decide what choice to make and leaving everything to the flow of the situation, Shirone's recovery was like rain during a drought.

"Shirone, what should I do? They're going to amputate Rian's arm. Rian is now..."

"No. Cutting off his arm would ruin Rian's life."

"But then he'll die! Rian will die!"

"Even if he dies, I can't allow it. I won't permit it."

Shirone's words pierced Tess's heart like a dagger.

Of course, Shirone was Rian's master. Even if he died, Rian wouldn't resent Shirone.

But then who would understand her heart?

"Tess, change your thinking. Rian wouldn't want this."

"I know! I want Rian to become the greatest swordsman too! But that's important to Rian, not to me! Even with one arm missing, I don't care!"

"How can you say such cruel things! Could you say the same thing in front of Rian when he's listening?"

"That's why I'm doing this! Since he's unconscious, I'll do as I please! Rian will give up the sword now. So you give up too! Doctor, please start quickly!"

"He's holding his sword!"

Tess's face turned pale as she turned toward Rian.

"Look at Rian! He's still holding his sword! Even with only bones left, he's still fighting! And you want to amputate? Until Rian gives up, no one can tell Rian to give up!"

Tess looked at Rian's arm.

Why wouldn't he let go of the sword? Did he intend to remain Shirone's sword until the moment of death? If so, she would never be able to have him all to herself for life.

But it didn't matter. Because that was Rian. Because he was that kind of Rian...

"I love him so very much."

Tess buried her face in Rian's chest.

She wouldn't treat him. If he held his sword until the last moment, then even in death he would be a swordsman.

A faint voice leaked from Rian's lips.

"Tess..."

Tess's head shot up.

"Rian! I'm here! Are you conscious? Does it hurt a lot?"

"Shirone, is Shirone..."

"It's okay! He returned safely! This is Gis's house! You're the most seriously injured!"

Rian tossed and turned, then sat up. When he looked at his right arm that had only bones left, his friends' hearts sank.

"What's this?"

Contrary to expectations, Rian didn't even raise an eyebrow. Being able to remain calm while looking at his ruined arm showed superhuman composure.

Tess realized that Shirone's words were right. He had known. From the day Rian made his knight's oath, how much resolve he had carved into his sword.

"Why is my arm like this? How did it get so damaged?"

Rian was merely displeased. With the nerves gone, there was no pain. The hand holding the sword didn't feel like his own.

"Rian, that there..."

At that moment, the greatsword fell from Rian's arm with a clatter. The bones of his five fingers spread wide and blood spurted from his shoulder.

"Rian! Rian!"

The physician pressed down on Rian's shoulder and shouted.

"The bleeding has started! Hurry, bring hemostatic medicine and bandages!"

No one moved.

As the physician glared at them with murderous eyes, a strange sound came from Rian's arm.

Glug glug.

It was the sound of a viscous liquid splashing around.

The physician who turned his head stared at Rian's arm in bewilderment, just like everyone else.

The blood flowing down from his shoulder was taking shape.

This was impossible. Even a grand mage of the healing arts couldn't cause changes in blood composition.

"You, just what are you..."

Rian calmly watched his arm being restored. As the nerves recovered, he gradually began to feel that it was his arm. After carefully examining each muscle fiber, he asked his friends.

"What happened? Someone explain it to me."

"You ate a giant's arm. You cut off the giant's arm, and that giant made you eat it. It turned into something like the liquid used in wine of tales and went down your throat."

"I cut off an arm? A giant's?"

Though it was only fragmentary images that couldn't be called memories, the scene of cutting Ymir's arm vaguely came to mind.

'At least I got one good hit in.'

When he put strength into his arm, he felt powerful force. Was this also a secret related to wine of tales?

At that moment, the room became quiet. When Rian looked around, everyone was gaping with their jaws dropped.

"What's wrong? Like you've never seen muscles before."

"Are you really okay? It looks like your skin is regenerating too?"

"That's right. I'm fine."

Shirone shouted.

"That's not what we mean, you idiot! We're asking how this is possible!"

"I don't know. It just happened this way, so I guess that's how it is."

No matter how bold he was, shouldn't he be suspicious about his own body? Maybe he wasn't bold at all, just stupid.

"He's awake! He's awake!"

The mages in charge of Canis shouted.

Canis, who had sat up, looked around with his eyelids half-closed, then frowned and said.

"Noisy. I'm so sleepy I could die, so don't wake me up."

And he lay back down on the bed and fell fast asleep again.

It was a natural reaction after being tormented by the sleep demon's Objet, but given the situation, his friends felt deflated first.

Arin stroked Canis's head and whispered.

"Sleep well, Canis."

@

For three days after returning from Heaven, Shirone's group received devoted patient care from Gis and Yuna.

Their average daily sleep was 16 hours, and their job was to sleep, eat, and sleep again.

When they gathered in the living room for dinner in the early evening, Shirone would tell them about what happened in Heaven.

However, he remained silent about the final war.

Rian frequently broke things with his right arm. His physical strength had become so great that it was uncontrollable. Tess told him that it would take time to develop even the small muscles needed to control his strength precisely.

Whenever Tess had time, she cleaned and maintained her drone. She never let it leave her body, and even while sleeping she would stroke it while making ghostly sounds, causing Amy and Arin to tremble in fear every night.

Canis and Arin spent a lot of time talking together. It seemed like they had gotten what they wanted from Heaven, but they didn't tell anyone what it was. However, he honestly confessed that he was the one who had shortened Kadum's lifespan.

Amy carried around the ancient spirit Jack O'Lantern lit. When she pointed at the bouncing flames and said they were cute, Rian told her that Amy was cuter.

When the boys and girls hung out separately, Amy would stare at Shirone for long periods. But true to her thorough personality, she never let her friends catch her.

Shirone often sat on the sofa lost in thought. When he did, the face of Archangel Ikael came to mind first.

The insight of Ataraxia remained warm and carved in his mind even now.

All the people who had gone to Heaven had achieved some success, but no one had received as great a gift as Shirone.

Canis complained that it was unfair and begged him to reveal the secret, but what he didn't know, he didn't know.

'Ikael... are you doing well?'

Due to the nature of its function, the Metagate had to be left in Heaven. The coordinates were reset, but with Heaven's technology, they might find a way to bypass Miro's spacetime with just that.

But at the final moment, Kariel ultimately couldn't defy Ikael's advice. As long as she sided with humans, the final war would not occur.

On the other hand, he wanted to meet her again. Thinking of Phoebe, who grumbled but had a tender heart, made longing wash over him.

"Shirone, let's go to sleep now. It would be good to rest well until today."

Amy was standing there in pajamas. Her appearance in the moonlight was beautiful.

Both of them had been plagued by a sense of obligation to talk about something for the past few days. But in the end, they concluded by looking at each other and smiling.

"Yeah, let's sleep."

Shirone entered the room where the boys were sleeping. In the small attic-like space, Rian's snoring echoed. Next to him, Canis had fallen asleep with a pillow covering both ears.

Shirone sat in the corner and stared into the darkness. When he thought that everything he had experienced was real, he felt a thrill. Starlight reflected in the eyes of Shirone, who was smiling tensely.

That night.

Gis, who had finished his work at the port and returned, burst through the front door. After catching his breath and looking around, he first rushed to the room where the boys were sleeping.

"This is terrible! Wake up! Quickly!"

When he opened the door and shouted, Canis's pillow flew over and smacked him in the face. No one woke up. Having been to Heaven and back, it seemed like nothing could be considered a big deal anymore.

"Wake up right now! Don't get angry later!"

Shirone rubbed his eyes and woke up.

"What's wrong? What happened?"

"Quickly wake up the others and come down! We have to leave now!"

Gis turned around without time to explain and went down to the first floor. Then he burst into the room where the girls were sleeping.

"Girls! Wake up! Yuna, you too, hurry!"

"Ugh, what..."

Amy, who had been fast asleep, crouched like an animal. Then when her mind cleared and she immediately grasped the reality of the situation, she glared with fierce eyes and turned her head.

"Hey! How can you just barge into a room where girls are sleeping! Do you want to die?"

"Aah! Sorry! I'm in too much of a hurry!"

Only after seeing the girls in their pajamas did Gis realize his mistake. Tess, who was sleeping with her navel exposed, looked like an adult no matter when you saw her. But there really was no time to delay, so he grabbed Amy's hand and pulled her.

"Don't regret it later and just wake up!"

"Okay, okay, I got it. Girls, everyone wake up. Gis has something to say."

"Ah, I'm tired. What's going on?"

Meanwhile, the boys came downstairs rubbing their sleepy eyes. Shirone reproached himself for striking a pose in the middle of the night and losing sleep time, while peeking toward the girls' room.

Arin and Tess were tidying the blankets, and Amy was being dragged out by Gis with sleepy eyes.

"You better know that if this isn't a big deal, I'm going to be angry. I'll multiply the punishment for entering the room and beat you up."

"Go ahead! Once you hear this, you'll change your mind!"

After much commotion, everyone gathered in the living room.

Gis pondered at what timing he should speak so his friends wouldn't die of heart attacks, then opened his mouth.

"Do you know what day today is?"

"I don't know. Is it your birthday?"

"No! It comes once every 10 years...!"

At that moment, Yuna, who had belatedly woken up, burst out of the girls' room in a hurry and shouted.

"Brother! Chaos! Chaos!"

Shirone tilted his head and asked.

"What's Chaos?"

Not to be outdone by Yuna, Gis shouted even louder.

"The water dragon! The water dragon Chaos is coming here!"

@

"Mister, please go a little faster!"

The carriage carrying Shirone's group raced toward the port.

Amy bit her lips anxiously. Since there hadn't even been time to prepare, she was still in her pajamas.
