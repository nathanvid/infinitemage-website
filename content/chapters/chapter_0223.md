"Isn't it too late already? Didn't you say it only stays for about 10 minutes?"

"That's why I said I needed to get up quickly. I was so busy taking care of you all that I forgot. I only realized it because the tourists weren't decreasing even though it's nighttime."

"Oh, please."

The water dragon Kaios is known to traverse the three great oceans that cross the equator over a period of 10 years.

It settles on Galliant Island for about 10 minutes, and the number of tourists who come to see the dragon reaches as many as 2,000 people.

When they arrived at the harbor, it was packed with people, leaving no room to squeeze through. It seemed impossible to walk to the dock.

Someone shouted that there were 10 minutes left.

Canis, who had been gauging the ratio of darkness in the surrounding space, grabbed Arin's hand.

"Well then, excuse us."

The two disappeared under the shadows. Using Darkfort, they could reach their destination without being detected.

Shirone's group was stunned. Amy in particular trembled with clenched fists and cursed Canis's appearance, describing various animal names and body parts in her fury.

"What should we do? Is there no way to get inside?"

"I'll go talk to the people at the harbor. Just wait."

As Gis tried to run to the management office, Amy grabbed him.

"It's already too late even if you try. Should we just watch from here?"

Someone shouted that there were 5 minutes left.

At that moment, flashes erupted from the end of the crowd and began to embroider the night sky with light. They were mages from the continent who had come to see Kaios.

Shirone and Amy looked at each other and grinned.

"Good! Let's go!"

Shirone's group, who had taken flight with teleportation, naturally blended into the flashes. In such a situation, who could tell who were students and who were mages?

Contrary to expectations that the breakwater area would be the most crowded, most people were gathered outside the dock perimeter.

Although Kaios had never harmed people on Galliant Island, it seemed that dragons were still frightening.

On the other hand, mages and swordsmen accustomed to fierce battles were gathered inside the dock.

The population density of trained individuals, which could only be seen in the capital's mercenary markets, gave a sense of just how popular the dragon was.

"Hey, I saved us a spot."

Canis, who had arrived first, greeted his friends without changing his expression. Amy rolled up her sleeves and approached.

"You traitor! Running away to save only yourself?"

"Did we need to get into life-or-death situations? Since we're here, we can just watch."

At that moment, people's cheers erupted.

Without even seeing what had happened, Shirone's group immediately turned and ran to the end of the dock.

A massive wall of water was rushing in from the distant sea. Judging by its size and speed, it was enough to submerge the harbor and more.

"Huh? Huuuuh?"

Shirone's group was terrified. As the tsunami approached within 200 meters, their breath caught in their throats.

Just when they thought they would inevitably be swept away, a massive object rose vertically from within the water.

The water's form collapsed, and thousands of tons of tremendous water streams were drawn up by Kaios.

"Aaaaah! Aaaah!"

Shirone's group screamed as if electrocuted. The dragon had lifted the entire sea. It was truly immeasurable magical power.

The rising water streams spread like a fountain 300 meters in the air, creating dozens of arches.

Kaios, who had enclosed itself within arches spanning over a kilometer in radius, displayed its overwhelming majesty.

Kiiiiiiiiiii!

A sorrowful and beautiful cry embroidered the sea.

At that moment, light burst from behind Shirone. People were aiming cylindrical devices at the water dragon and shooting light at it.

"Why are they doing that? Are they attacking?"

At Shirone's innocent words, Gis laughed.

"No, those are optical cameras. They're devices that can capture light as is, and they're incredibly expensive. But on days like today, they sell like hotcakes. There are even professional photographers who travel the world taking pictures of Kaios exclusively."

As Kaios displayed graceful flight like a diving swim, large fireworks prepared by the Galliant autonomous government filled the sky.

According to Gis, because the tourism income was enormous, they spared no expense.

Watching the dragon swimming between the fireworks seeping into the arches made of water columns was the sweetest delight one could taste with their eyes.

Amy looked at Gis with sparkling eyes.

"Gis, thank you. This alone made coming to the island worthwhile."

"Hehe, I promised, didn't I? That I'd give you a proper tour."

Tess was stimulated by the sight of Canis and Arin holding hands affectionately. Thinking she couldn't miss such a good opportunity, she slyly embraced Rian's arm.

"Wh-what? What are you doing all of a sudden?"

When Rian recoiled as if a bug had attached to him, Tess's eyes widened in bewilderment.

"Hey, isn't that too much? No matter how hideous I am, could I be worse than your forearm?"

"Ah, no, it's not like that. I was just really startled."

Normally she would have been unpleasantly disappointed, but the spectacle over the sea was so splendid and beautiful that it made her forget even such emotions.

The water dragon turned toward the audience as if bidding farewell. The arches spread rapidly toward the distant sea, and twelve consecutive fireworks burst against the silver-platter-like moon.

Tess began to sob.

"Sniff, I don't know..."

Her friends looked back in surprise. Rian, who felt particularly guilty, couldn't hide his bewilderment.

"Why, why are you like this? It's really not because I dislike you. It was just too sudden..."

"Be quiet, you fool. I've grown attached, you see. What am I going to do now?"

Her friends' hearts were no different from Tess's.

"We have to go back tomorrow. I don't want to part. Should I change jobs to become a mage too? Then I could always see you at school."

"What are you talking about? Tess should naturally become a swordsman. Once we graduate, we can meet anytime."

At Shirone's comfort, Tess nodded repeatedly. Then she called Amy and Arin over and clasped their hands.

"Let's write letters to each other, okay? We'll keep in touch."

Arin pointed to herself.

"Me, me too?"

"Of course! You're a Heaven faction member! Where else in the world would you find such strong friendship?"

Amy recalled the day she first met Tess.

There had been awkward moments, but now she loved doing things with her. There wouldn't be anyone in the world who wouldn't love Tess, with her just and warm heart.

"Right. We'll definitely see each other again. Next time, just us girls."

"Good! With this, the Heaven faction is formed!"

Shirone's group turned their steps toward home.

Since it was a special day, the shops were open 24 hours, but they wanted to spend the last part of their vacation intimately with their friends.

When they arrived home, Gis found a letter in the mailbox.

"Huh? It's a letter from the captain? It came for you?"

"From Marsha?"

On the day they arrived in heaven, his physical condition wasn't normal, so he couldn't even say goodbye properly. When he woke up from deep sleep, the Parrot Bandits had already left the island.

Shirone unfolded the letter and read it for a long time.

"Haha! That's so like Marsha!"

Amy's eyes narrowed mischievously.

"What? What does it say that's so funny?"

"Hm? Oh, it's nothing."

"Hey! Won't you hand it over quickly? What, is it a love letter or something?"

When Amy threw herself forward to snatch it, Shirone obediently placed the letter in her hands.

Then it was Amy who became flustered.

"Wh-what? What do you mean by actually giving it to me? If it's important content, I don't need to read it..."

"No. It should be fine. Probably."

If it's fine then it's fine, but what did "probably" mean? Grumbling, Amy read the letter and tilted her head.

Nothing was written on the paper.

"What's this? It's just blank paper."

"Right. But she left a letter."

Tess smiled with a knowing expression.

"I see. She left a letter."

Shirone looked toward the distant sky. The blank paper contained all the words she wanted to convey.

This was Marsha. Someday they would meet again.

'I should write a letter when I get back.'

He wished her well in her future endeavors.

**Waiting for the New Semester (1)**

Returning home, Shirone spent enjoyable time with his parents and wrote letters to his friends whenever he had leisure time.

While Marsha had conveyed emotions with blank paper, he couldn't match her wit. So he filled the content with even more care.

"I'm done. Now I just need to send them."

Tomorrow he planned to go to the city to mail the letters. By the time the letters reached his friends, the vacation would be nearly over. After returning from heaven, he had realized the preciousness of daily life. He wanted to return to school as soon as possible to see his friends.

"Shirone, come downstairs and eat."

"Yes, I'm coming now."

At his mother's voice calling from the first floor, Shirone blew out the candle and left his room.

@

The capital, Bashka.

The Mercordain private residence located in the royal castle management district.

On the humble dining table unsuitable for a first-class noble, unknown wild vegetable side dishes that even ascetics might chew were laid out.

Though Iruki's mother was disgusted, the Mercordain father and son enjoyed simple meals. They disliked how the satiation after eating meat dulled their thinking.

Iruki scooped rice with his fork and occasionally chewed vegetables.

Across from him sat a man who looked exactly like Iruki, just with a few wrinkles added, eating his meal.

Iruki's father and current head of the Lightning Brigade, Mercordain Albino. Though not a Servant, he was so knowledgeable about everything that it was said no one in the world knew what he didn't know.

Albino asked at an odd timing.

"How is the entropy problem coming along?"

"I think I've more or less solved it."

Iruki answered without even lifting his head. Their relationship wasn't bad, but he thought that hearing questions and giving answers only required ears and a mouth.

Having finished his meal, Albino put down his utensils and asked.

"Iruki, what is 1 plus 1?"

"2."

"No. It's 3."

For the first time, Iruki lifted his head. This was exactly the kind of situation that required eyes.

"No, it's 2."

"Then try making it 3."

"Why?"

Albino shrugged.

"Does it matter?"

"I suppose not."

"Prove it and bring it to me. If you can do this, you'll get closer to the answer you're seeking. It's your last homework for this vacation."

"I think it'll take at least 6 days."

Albino's eyes gleamed.

"Oh ho, you're already getting a feel for it?"

"No. You're going on a business trip in 5 days."

Iruki resumed consuming rice. Grain by grain, grain by grain. If there was just the minimum energy needed to operate his brain, satiation was the enemy. Having worked his mind non-stop during vacation, even a Servant's brain felt overloaded.

Albino spoke belatedly.

"I won't check. I'll just trust that you did it and go."

"This is the first time I've known father trusts me."

Albino smiled. Even if he couldn't solve the Akashic Record within 6 days, it didn't matter. He was just proud of his son who calculated his business trip period first.

"No knowledge can beat wisdom. Let's say you won."

"Thank you for the meal."

Iruki bowed his head and cleared the dishes. While Albino read the newspaper while drinking tea, after finishing the dishes, just as he was about to turn around, the head butler entered.

"Young master, a letter has arrived. It's from someone named Arian Shirone."

"Huh? Shirone?"

As Iruki brightened and rushed over, Albino pretended to read the newspaper while secretly observing his son.

Arian Shirone. It was the word that had come up most frequently - 3,742 times total - from his son's mouth after finishing this semester.

In his opinion, Iruki was good material. He had the capacity of a genius and rich human emotions.

He had suffered because of such tendencies when he was young, but his son who returned after finishing this semester was different.

He no longer feared his own talent, and the boy named Shirone had played an important role in that.
