"Haha! That's so like Shirone. What kind of letter is this long?"

Seeing his son laugh so cheerfully was a rare sight at home. Eventually declaring defeat and lowering his newspaper, he asked Iruki.

"Is this the boy you mentioned?"

"Yes, I sent him a letter. He writes really well."

"If you're that close, invite him home. An Unlocker, you say? I'd like to meet him once."

"......Alright. I'll ask him about it."

Iruki's response was soulless. Introducing Shirone wasn't the problem, but introducing his eccentric father to his friends was an enormously big problem.

'Six days from now, father.'

The central city of Sadia is the region where the most local nobles reside in Tormia.

True to its reputation as a famous granary region, its finances were solid, so there were few forces expanding outward, but it was characterized by fierce internal competition for territory, causing rankings to change frequently. Nade's family, the Wests, were no exception.

During the vacation, Nade practically lived in his workshop. Having stayed up all night for the second day straight, his eyes were sunken and hollow.

The workshop looked like an expanded version of the supernatural psychic science research club. Tools of unknown purpose rolled around on the floor, and engine parts of mechanical devices were placed on the table.

"Phew, shall I call it a day?"

Though the season had moved into autumn, the workshop was stuffy. When he threw off his shirt, scars crossing his back diagonally were revealed. Though they were old wounds, they sometimes throbbed unbearably.

Nade pulled over a tarp to cover the table. If his family found out, there would be an uproar about spending money on useless things.

Though now fallen, just three generations ago, half of Sadia's granary region belonged to the West family.

Nade had never heard the reason why the family fortune declined. But after living for seventeen years, he suspected there was no special reason. They had simply spent it all.

"Nade, Nade."

Upon returning to the mansion, he heard a voice that stopped his heart.

It was ironic that the voice belonged to his mother, but to Nade, she was the most frightening existence in the world.

"Yes, mother."

"You said you're good with machines, right? Go to the Jones family and repair something for them."

"Let me get some sleep first and then I'll go."

His mother's expression crumpled like a monster's. It was like a lock that rendered Nade completely immobile.

When he was young, he had once defied his mother. But she had resorted to self-harm, making him a complete unfilial son.

He couldn't beat a mother who hurt herself. There is no child in the world who can beat their parents.

"I'm tired. I haven't slept for two days."

"What exactly are you doing? You're not going out to earn money, and you're not helping the household either. I didn't tell you not to sleep, so why are you saying you can't go?"

Nade held back his contorting facial muscles. He didn't want to become the same face as his mother.

"Don't you see how hard your mother lives? Do you know how much money it costs to send you to that fancy magic school? If that's the case, you might as well disappear from this house. I don't think I can support you anymore."

Nade tried to think of when she had ever supported him. But he had no such memories. Only the terrible wound carved into his back throbbed.

None of the West family members tried to start even a small business with their remaining assets. They did nothing. Because they had never done anything.

"I'm sorry, mom. I understand. I'll go."

Burning pain radiated from Nade's wound. But he couldn't show it. His family couldn't move against her. No, they avoided dealing with her because they didn't want to.

And whenever she resorted to self-harm, all the family's frustration would pour onto Nade.

When he was young, he didn't know why only he had to suffer. But what he realized through living was that there was no reason for it.

Nade's family pushed everything onto others, and only he knew that this shouldn't be the case.

"Go quickly before sunset. The Jones family is looking for someone to check their boiler. Don't you want to try being a repairman or something?"

"I think I'll be able to graduate soon. Please let me graduate from school first."

"That damn school is a parasite that teaches nothing but sucks up money, isn't it? I might as well die instead."

Nade wanted to understand his mother.

She had married into a wealthy family, but the whole family was spending money, so her heartbreak was understandable.

But no matter how much he thought about it, he couldn't find a reason why he should become a boiler repairman for them.

After his mother returned to the mansion, hot breath escaped between Nade's teeth.

It felt like murderous intent was forming in every cell. Just a little more... if it accumulated just a little more, it would explode.

"Young master, there's a letter... Eek!"

The butler who had come running turned pale. Only then coming to his senses, Nade shook his head. The moment he realized his mother's face was also dwelling within him, a second wave of pain crashed over him.

"Ah, I haven't slept. What is it?"

"A le-letter... from Arian Shirone."

"What? Shirone?"

Nade's face immediately brightened. Snatching the letter right away, he read through the words written in Shirone's handwriting.

The moment he saw the phrase saying he missed him, sorrowful feelings welled up and tears began to form.

"Wait just a little, Shirone! I'll be right there!"

Nade clutched the letter and left the mansion. The Jones family wouldn't need boiler repairs for the next ten years.

Ceriel's family, the Fortress, had their main house in Creas city, just like Amy.

Though their noble rank wasn't particularly high, they were a prestigious family that had produced many great doctors and had high recognition in the kingdom.

At school, she was the best friend of model student Amy, but at home she was a wild filly who pushed her doctor-aspiring younger brother to the front and slipped away to the back.

Today too, she had been hiding for three days to avoid her mother's nagging. Her younger brother's room, who was expected to become the greatest doctor, was a nagging-free zone that the family didn't visit.

"Sob sob! What should I do? This is so touching."

Ceriel, who had been reading a romance novel under the covers, finally couldn't hold back and burst into tears.

Her younger brother Vail, sitting at the desk, was going crazy.

"Ugh, be quiet! I'm studying! Go to your own room now! Or stop crying altogether."

Ceriel hugged the novel that ended tragically and savored the lingering emotions. By her own assessment, it was among the top stories she'd read during vacation.

"It was such a sad love story. Ah, isn't there a man like Joseph somewhere?"

Vail looked up from his notes.

"There is."

"Really? Who?"

"Joseph."

"You're asking for trouble! Are you playing pranks on your sister?"

"Why? If he doesn't exist in reality, you'll have to grab onto a character and live with that, hehe."

Ceriel glared at the back of her brother's head and pouted. She hadn't gotten angry because she owed him for letting her stay for several days, but he was getting completely carried away.

Just then the door opened and along with their mother's nagging, a letter dropped with a thud.

"A letter came! I won't tell you to study, so don't disturb your brother and come out. If you're going to play around, at least wash up. I wonder if she'll ever get married like that. Tsk tsk."

Ceriel stuck out her lips and crawled under the bed.

Thinking it was from Amy since it was a letter, she was surprised to see an unexpected sender.

"Oh? It's Shirone! Shirone!"

Ceriel quickly opened the envelope and read it. Her eyes immediately became loving. After smelling the fragrance on the paper, she hugged the letter to her chest and murmured.

"Ah, isn't there a man like Shirone somewhere?"

Vail, who had been reading diligently, looked haggard.

'Shirone is a real person, you idiot. Just go date him.'

These words rose to his throat, but that woman wouldn't hear anything anyway. After digging into novels for several days, she was clearly not in her right mind.

Creas City Public Training Ground.

Mark paid the expensive entrance fee and entered the training ground. Having succeeded in early promotion along with Maria, he would be assigned to Class Six from next semester, and his heart was already racing with excitement.

'Finally, I'll have upperclassman juniors too.'

If he hadn't met Shirone, this day would never have come. Thanks to constantly working hard with Shirone as his role model after being defeated at the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed, he had achieved his desired goal.

"Hey there, Maria."

"You came? You're earlier than yesterday today?"

When Maria, who had been waiting at the training ground first, made a joke mixed with reproach, Mark laughed. She had been depressed enough to operate the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed's mechanism and put students in danger, but her personality had brightened considerably since becoming Sad's direct disciple.

"Sorry. My father was dropping hints. He was asking why I bother going out to train when there are good teachers at the Magic Association."

"I see. The Slider family has connections at the Magic Association. Are you really okay with continuing together?"

"No problem. I'm a man who does what he says he'll do."

Mark winked and gave a thumbs up. In truth, he had barely escaped after going without breakfast until morning. At some point, the fifteen-year-old boy had begun to see his nineteen-year-old sister figure as a woman.

'I must be completely crazy. To think I had thoughts of bothering such a cute sister.'

"Hey! Did you wait long? Sorry for being late."

When Sad came running from the training ground entrance, Mark's expression soured. He was none other than his greatest rival. It was ridiculous that teacher and student were playing tug-of-war over one woman, but a twenty-six-year-old man and nineteen-year-old woman was a decent age gap, and the problem was that Sad didn't seem displeased either.

Whether she knew Mark's feelings or not, Maria greeted Sad with a more affectionate smile than anyone else's.

"Not at all. We just arrived too."

"Good. I was a bit late seeing off the headmaster."

"Oh my, where did the headmaster go?"

"Yeah. Something came up. Anyway, sorry for making you wait."

Mark, excluded from the conversation, felt uncomfortable. He was sick of experiencing Sad's womanizing personality, but he was particularly annoyed by how especially affectionate he was toward Maria.

Just then Maria clapped her hands and pulled out a letter from her bag.

"Ah, right! Did you see this? A letter came from Shirone senior."

"Huh? From Shirone senior? I didn't get one."

"You probably did. I just picked it up on my way out. I haven't even read it yet."

Maria proudly waved the envelope, then took out the letter and read it. Her expression melted at the content full of sincere affection.

"Ah, he's really such a wonderful person. Strong yet gentle. How happy must Amy senior be, dating Shirone senior?"

A strange tension appeared on Sad's face.

To be honest, he had about 70% confidence that Maria had fallen for him completely. But hearing this now, he thought it might just be simple admiration.

When Sad became gloomy, Mark felt triumphant.

Most of the female underclassmen talked like Maria, so he didn't feel jealous of Shirone.

Above all, wasn't there Amy, an insurmountable barrier, standing firmly by Shirone's side?

'Good! My goal of following Shirone senior's footsteps has been further strengthened!'

The anxious Sad tried to recover.

"Haha! Right. Shirone is cool indeed. But don't people usually prefer older partners? Or at least someone the same age. Younger men aren't fun, right?"

Mark shot back not to be outdone.

"What kind of talk is that? They say love has no borders, so what does age matter?"

"Age is more important than borders. Should we ask Maria then? Between older and younger, which would you choose?"

Maria rested her chin in thought, then playfully stuck out her tongue and avoided answering.

"Hehe, who knows?"

Mark and Sad, who had been eagerly waiting, were deflated. Perhaps she was the true master of push-and-pull.

Anyway, they couldn't just chat after paying expensive entrance fees. Mark and Maria began warming up their minds with sequence formulas before starting the real lesson. Meanwhile, Sad looked up at the sky and thought of Shirone.

'Vacation is almost over now. What kind of trouble will he cause when he returns?'

Shirone's path since entering magic school was definitely unique throughout the school's history.

But that's why he was anxious.

Depending on what answer his master received and brought back, it would be completely different from school life so far if approval was granted.

'This time won't be easy, Shirone.'
