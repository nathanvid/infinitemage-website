The capital, Bashka.

The Jerome family had been an educator household that produced excellent teachers for generations, making it one of the most prestigious families in the kingdom.

The joke about who ranks higher than the king—the king's teacher—wasn't entirely wrong.

If you gathered all the disciples they had raised, it would be enough to run an entire nation without any problems.

Alpheas, who had arrived at the Jerome family's main house, walked through the ancient-style corridor under the butler's guidance.

Though they had known each other for thirty years, this was his first time visiting her room.

When the butler opened the door, a magnificent scene greeted him.

The floor was so clean it reflected faces, and shelves divided into three tiers along the walls displayed all kinds of antiques.

To the north lay a tiger-skin carpet large enough for ten people to lie down on with room to spare. Given her character of despising fakes, it was certainly genuine. However, he wondered if tigers that large actually existed in the world.

The woman sat on a sofa atop the tiger-skin carpet. Though she was in her fifties, she looked young enough to pass for thirty.

She was beautiful even now, but in her youth, she had been truly magnificent. She had been so aloof and pristine that men couldn't even easily speak to her.

"If you're here, close the door and sit down. What are you staring at like an idiot? Still as stupid as ever."

Alpheas couldn't help but laugh.

Her temperament of looking down on all men in the world remained unchanged. Her melodious voice like a nightingale was the same too, making him feel as if time had reversed.

"Well, it's fascinating. I wondered what kind of place you were living in, and it seems you've transplanted your personality exactly as it was."

"Barging into someone else's house uninvited and then shamelessly spouting nonsense. How would a country bumpkin like you understand the value of my possessions?"

The carpet was certainly of the highest quality. So Alpheas deliberately stepped all over the carpet with his shoes on.

It was a bit of mischief from the person who had once made the most prideful woman in the world cling to his trouser legs and beg.

She didn't scold Alpheas. But contrary to his expectations, her expression showed disbelief.

"What are you doing right now? Ah, never mind. Just state your business briefly."

Alpheas smiled mischievously. His appearance was the same as thirty years ago.

Jerome Olivia.

A certified second-class Great Magician and currently an inspector for the Teachers' Council. Moreover, she had even served as principal of the Royal Magic School four years ago.

"What business could there be? I came directly since there was no response."

"What do you expect me to do? You caused trouble and got suspended from teaching, so why should I clean up after you? A rural magic school principal? And a six-month temporary position at that?"

"It's not necessarily set in stone. If you want to stay longer, you can."

"So why? What reason do I have to leave this nice house and go down to the countryside?"

"In our situation of growing old together, it would be nice to leisurely drink tea."

Olivia revealed cold anger. Then she looked even more like her younger self.

"Aren't you misunderstanding something? My admiration for you was thirty years ago. Besides, you haven't forgotten how you treated me back then, have you? Most importantly, you're no longer attractive."

"Haha! That's how it turned out. But you're still beautiful."

Olivia ground her teeth. This is why she hated men. Acting like spoiled children who think they own everything just because a woman gave her heart once.

The sight of him smiling shamelessly despite being unemployed with nothing to boast about after even losing his principal position was revolting.

"What exactly are you to be so confident? I'm a certified second-class Great Magician who served as principal of the Royal Magic School. You're a fourth-class magician and a rural school principal. I earn more money than you and receive more respect. So what reason do you have to act so shamelessly when you're the one asking for a favor?"

"Hmm, well? Maybe because you like me?"

"You... crazy... bastard."

Olivia's face flushed red. Spouting such nauseating words at their age. Had he developed a late-life infatuation? He was casually saying things he never would have said before.

"Let me be honest. I was afraid you'd be sad if I showed a pathetic appearance after meeting for the first time in so long."

"Oh my, not at all! I've imagined countless times the sight of you coming to me and kneeling."

Alpheas smiled bitterly. Indeed, looking back, her wounds had probably been deeper than his own.

"Fine. If you're going to say that much, I'll ask you refreshingly. Should I kneel here?"

Olivia responded with a snort. What would kneeling matter at this point?

"What do you do these days? You lost your job too. Are you really having a late-life romance?"

"Just, well, reading books, taking walks. Talking about this and that with Erina."

Shock struck Olivia's eyes for the first time.

Alpheas's first and last love. Erina still lived in his heart.

'He still can't forget her. What a complete blockhead.'

Alpheas, who had wandered for ten years after losing his wife and then returned, harbored dreams of teaching and entered as a student under the much younger Olivia. Being the genius who established photon theory, Olivia taught him with affection.

Affection. That was the problem. She shouldn't have taken him as a student—someone older than her, more talented, and above all, handsome.

Unable to control her growing love, Olivia eventually confessed her feelings to Alpheas.

However, Alpheas, who couldn't forget his wife, rejected her outright, and from that day forward, her life changed 180 degrees. She spent countless nights crying from her wounded pride.

What truly infuriated her was the pathetic fact that she had lost the man she loved to a woman who no longer existed in this world.

The burning love of her twenties was blind to everything. Eventually, she even went so far as to vandalize Erina's portrait in front of Alpheas.

Olivia felt Alpheas's killing intent for the first time. She clung to his trouser legs and pleaded, but from that day forward, Alpheas didn't even treat her as human.

It would have been better if it had stopped there. But Olivia at the time was too desperate and passionate. She didn't have the courage to give up her first love.

But she shouldn't have done it. Going to Alpheas's room that night was the mistake of a lifetime.

"Don't misunderstand, Alpheas. The reason I never married wasn't because of you. I just find the male species bothersome."

"So that's why you collect strange objects? Olivia, no human being doesn't desire love."

"It's a base emotion. Even my courtship back then was because of pride. Since you were bewitched by a dead woman and wouldn't even give me any attention."

"Suddenly... I'm reminded of that night's events."

Olivia's face turned pale.

"Coming to my room and taking off your clothes..."

"Stop!"

Olivia reached out her hand and shouted. Though it had been thirty years, it was as vivid as if it had happened yesterday. It was the first and last time she had shown her naked body to a man.

At the time, she had wanted to win Alpheas's heart even by such means. But he wouldn't even grant her request to be held just once.

'That bastard...'

Even now thinking about it, she felt so wronged she could cry.

Bragging about the most shameful moment of her life as if it were something to be proud of. Why must women always be the ones who suffer?

'I can't forgive this. I'll make him regret it.'

Having failed to gain the upper hand, Olivia decided to get to the main point and picked up the document envelope on the sofa.

"Fine. Let me take a look."

The document contained information about Alpheas Magic School.

"Alpheas Magic School. Fourth among the five prestigious magic schools. Eleventh among all special-purpose schools. Not bad for an idiot. When it first opened, it was truly unwatchable."

"I was lucky. I had many good students."

Olivia wanted to smack the smug Alpheas on the head like she used to when they had a master-student relationship.

"I heard the story. There's a child named Shirone, right?"

"You investigated quite thoroughly. Were you planning to accept from the beginning?"

"Think what you want about that. What I'm curious about is that it only rose in the early period. Looking at just the past ten years' achievements, it's barely hanging on among the five prestigious schools."

"I did my best to provide students with a good learning environment. Isn't that enough? The school's ranking isn't important."

"Haha! Still as old-fashioned as ever."

Olivia uncrossed her legs and leaned forward.

"Fine. Six months. I'll take charge. I'll make it a much more prestigious school than it is now."

"Oh? That sounds ominous. I'd be grateful if you would."

"But there's a condition."

Alpheas raised one eyebrow and smiled. He hadn't expected her to grant his request without compensation from the start.

"There are students I taught when I was principal of the Royal Magic School. Transfer those children to your school. Here are their profiles."

Alpheas delayed his answer and received the profiles first.

They were two seventeen-year-old boys and a girl of the same age, with grades that stood out even at the Royal Magic School, the kingdom's most prestigious institution.

As he examined the three profiles one by one, Alpheas's eyes widened greatly at the last page.

"Dante? Is this the same Dante I know?"

Olivia covered her mouth and laughed.

"Hoho! He's too good a student for your school. But now I'm the principal, so whatever."

Alpheas just blinked like an idiot. He hadn't expected even the formidable Olivia to go all-out to this extent.

Olivia pointed at Alpheas and declared.

"Airhan Dante and two others will transfer. That's my condition."

@

Five magicians raced through the treacherous mountain terrain.

It was a young party composed of people in their early to mid-twenties, all certified professionals in their respective fields.

The target of their raid was a bandit hideout nestled in the mountain range near the capital—a force that couldn't be overlooked with their wanted criminal rank of B.

While defeating the bandit group would bring fame and rewards, their reason for climbing the mountain today was different from usual.

"Why is it so quiet? Are they already dead? No matter how bratty they are, they're still kids."

"Hmph! What does it matter? We didn't kill them. You were there too. You saw how much those brats looked down on us. Just because they're from the Royal Magic School, they think they're everything?"

"Right. No matter how immature they are, to disrespect active certified magicians. Kids these days are too arrogant. They need to get badly burned once to come to their senses."

When they actually arrived at the hideout, it was as quiet as death.

Opening the door with puzzled feelings, an amazing scene unfolded. All forty B-rank bandits were sprawled across the floor.

The students sitting at the round table greeted them.

"Oh? You're late? We've been waiting quite a while."

The mercenaries were speechless. They had only departed ten minutes late from the starting line. Annihilating a B-rank bandit group in that time was impossible at a student level.

"You, just who are you people?"

"Getting so serious over something trivial? How embarrassing for adults. Hehe!"

A boy with an unusually tall and muscular build for a magician burst into laughter.

It was Bonifar Closer, a student from the Royal Magic School.

With bronze skin, sharp features, and dark brown hair slicked back that stood up like a hedgehog.

"Hehehe! Just a few days ago you were boasting so confidently. Did you come late on purpose because you were scared?"

A cat-like girl, Victor Sabina, mocked the mercenaries with a smile. Though short for her age, she was well-developed with a wasp-like waist.

The mercenaries gritted their teeth. Being defeated by students was humiliating for active magicians. Above all, if the truth got out, it could be grounds for expulsion from the mercenary industry.

"I think it's time to acknowledge it, don't you? We won, right?"

Airhan Dante, the instigator of all these events, spoke. He was a handsome man with storm-cloud gray hair who looked both fierce and intelligent.

The mercenaries hung their heads. The most important things for active magicians are reputation and achievements. What client would pay to hire magicians defeated by students?
