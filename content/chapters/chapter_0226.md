"We lost. Please, keep this matter secret."

"Huh? Weren't you just saying you'd crush our pride and get us expelled?"

Though trembling with humiliation, the mercenary leader was someone who could face reality. He had to endure this for the sake of his and his comrades' future.

"I'm sorry! Please help us just this once! You're going to become a mage too, aren't you? Even if we're seniors in name, there's no need to completely destroy our livelihood, right?"

Dante shook his head as if it wasn't enough.

The mercenaries realized what the boy was demanding and reddened with shame. Eventually, even the four standing in the back bowed politely and apologized.

"Please understand our situation. We have to make a living too, don't we?"

Finally satisfied, Dante placed his hand on the leader's shoulder.

"Don't worry about it. I was just bored during vacation and wanted to have some fun. But weren't you being too careless? I wonder how you even got your official certification?"

At that moment, the door opened and a woman entered. The mercenaries reflexively straightened their bent backs and acted as if nothing had happened.

"Oh my! You're already finished. Ah, what a shame."

It was a woman with curly, short hair that touched her cheeks. Her mischievous face looked to be in her early twenties, but she was actually over thirty.

"You are... Killine?"

She was a woman working in the academic journal compilation department under the Teachers' Council, a correspondent who traveled around the country's magic schools writing reports.

The articles she wrote were published in a magazine called *Spirit*, which was distributed to magic schools nationwide, so getting featured meant fame was just a matter of time.

"I came after hearing rumors, and you really did it magnificently. Dante, was this entire devastating scene created by your hands?"

As Killine made exaggerated gestures, the accompanying photographer snapped pictures with an optical camera.

The mercenaries didn't know what to do with themselves in this embarrassing situation.

While *Spirit* magazine was just a nostalgic memory for them, it was also a major magazine distributed nationwide. If their disgrace was published as an article, it would bring shame to their families.

"No, not at all. How could I defeat them alone without the seniors' help? I asked them to help with practical training, and they graciously agreed. I learned a lot. Thank you, seniors."

When Dante turned around, the mages, who were second to none in reading situations, quickly changed their expressions.

"Haha! This much is nothing. But you were impressive. Truly worthy of the kingdom's top star, right?"

Killine's eyes lit up as she turned around.

"Oh my! Do you know Dante? As expected, the kingdom's proud rising star is different indeed. He's still a student, yet rumors about him have spread even among active mages."

"Of course. We sometimes discuss Dante with our colleagues. We believe that someday Dante will become a first-class Great Magician."

Killine carefully recorded the leader's interview.

*Spirit* was already a popular magazine, but on days when articles about Dante were published, sales jumped by 1.5 times.

Dante's appearance was beautiful enough to capture girls' hearts, and the jealous attention from men wasn't without influence either.

'Aw, how cute. He's really grown well, our Dante.'

Having exclusively interviewed Dante since he was young, Killine could be said to have been promoted alongside Dante. Her current success as the kingdom's top reporter was also thanks to Dante.

"Well, since the interview is over, let's go for the after-party. The Teachers' Council will pay handsomely!"

As Dante left the hideout, an Airhine butler who had been waiting outside approached with a box.

"Young Master Dante, Lady Olivia has sent a package."

"My master? What's this sudden business about?"

"I don't know that either... However, the head of the family instructed me to deliver it personally."

Even Dante, who feared nothing in the world, would obey completely when it came to Olivia's words. She was his master and benefactor who had recognized his talent from childhood and gotten him admitted to the Royal Magic School. The same went for his peers Closer and Sabina.

"I understand. Give it here."

Taking the package and unwrapping it, a thick application form appeared. As Dante read through it page by page, his brow furrowed deeply.

"What? This is a transfer application?"

Closer and Sabina looked over his shoulders. Not only Dante's profile but their own profiles were attached as well.

Killine clung to them.

"What is it, Dante? Huh? What is it?"

"Well, it's... a transfer application. My master is apparently taking on a temporary principal position at some school. She's asking if we want to study together..."

Closer said, "Then of course we have to go. If our master is going, how can we not follow?"

Sabina asked, "Where is it? Isn't the school name written?"

"No, it says Alpheas Magic School. But where is this school located?"

Students living in Bashka weren't interested in regional information. Dante's group only knew that it was one of the kingdom's top five prestigious schools.

Killine sensed a scoop and her eyes lit up.

"Oh my, Alpheas Magic School? And Olivia as temporary principal? This is a huge story. Alpheas Magic School is ranked 4th in the magic school hierarchy. It's in Creas City. The most famous graduate is the current Magic Association Chairman, Mikea Gaold."

"Ah, so Gaold graduated from there."

Though they were lukewarm about the 4th ranking, their eyes changed when they heard Gaold's name. If it was a place where one of the kingdom's only five certified first-class Great Magicians had studied, transferring there seemed like it would at least save face.

Closer said, "Let's go. The new term is starting nationwide anyway. We can transfer to match the timing."

"Right. Master will probably take her position then too."

Dante pocketed the letter and gave the application to Sabina. He could hear the detailed circumstances when they met, and for now, he was just happy that something interesting had happened in his boring daily life.

Dante looked back at his friends and smiled as he watched the sunset falling behind the mountains.

"This should be interesting. Alpheas Magic School."

**Where is Shirone? (1)**

The second half of the Alpheas Magic School term had begun.

From morning, the main gate was crowded with carriages carrying students.

There was a spectacle of young students accompanied by their parents crying and refusing to go to school.

In contrast, adolescent boys crossed the main gate with indifferent expressions, as if even receiving care from butlers was embarrassing.

The entrance ceremony was scheduled for 11 AM, and students returned to their dormitories to unpack.

Shirone, who had arrived early in the morning, also placed his brought books on the bookshelf and arranged his clothes and daily necessities.

"Shirone!"

His friends burst through the door.

"Nade! Iruki!"

Shirone also ran toward them with a beaming smile. They had only been apart for 30 days, but it felt like they hadn't seen each other for a year.

So many things had happened. What expressions would the two make if they knew he had gone to heaven?

Grasping each other's hands, they all shouted at the same time:

"I had an incredible experience!"

And then they stared at each other blankly.

They didn't know what had happened, but they could predict that today would be short.

"Good. Let's decide the order. Shirone, you go first."

"Alright. I went to Galliant Island with Amy...!"

Suddenly Nade grabbed him by the collar.

"What! Then you... surely... that...! Damn it! This traitor! I'm jealous!"

Shirone's face turned bright red.

"No! It's not that, keep listening to the story."

"Argh! This is unbelievable. No matter how much of a lifelong bachelor I am, I thought I'd be faster than Shirone. How...!"

Nade was on the verge of losing his mind.

Seeing even Iruki's pupils shaking, it seemed that issue was indeed the greatest dilemma for men.

Shirone could only start his story after firmly denying it.

An hour quickly passed. But none of them realized how much time had elapsed.

"Wow. You really... came back from the dead. That was an incredibly dangerous situation."

"That's true, but about the final war. This is... so serious that it doesn't sound serious."

Due to the strong impression of heaven, Nade and Iruki were lost in thought for a long time.

Meanwhile, Shirone, feeling relieved after unburdening himself, wanted to hear how his other friends had spent their time.

"Now you guys tell me. What amazing things happened during vacation?"

The two looked at each other, then Iruki spoke first.

"I ate ice cream that tasted like crayfish."

"A spider the size of a fist appeared in my workshop."

"Haha! You really had fun."

Just imagining it was funny. Ice cream tasting like crayfish. Moreover, thinking of a fist-sized spider in front of you was spine-chilling.

"Damn it!"

Nade pushed Shirone's cheek with his fist.

"Ow! Why are you doing that?"

"You had such an exciting vacation by yourself! And with the incredibly pretty Senior Amy!"

"I really almost died! And what's with 'incredibly pretty Amy'? How childish! Ow!"

While Nade pushed Shirone's face again, Iruki was beating the ground in regret.

"What a waste. I should have pretended to be crazy and not returned home. I'm curious about that Ataraxia magic or whatever it was. Can you show it to me?"

"Huh? Ataraxia?"

While he could demonstrate it anytime, the situation wasn't suitable. There was the problem of mental energy depletion, and casting it in a place with people would only complicate things unnecessarily.

"I'd like to, but next time. I'll show you when there's a chance."

"Oh? Being stingy? Fine, then I'll also keep my new magic hidden for a while."

At the mention of new magic, Shirone's eyes lit up. If it was Iruki with his Servant Syndrome, his new magic would surely be on a different level from what ordinary students learned.

"What is it? Huh? What kind of magic?"

"It's a secret. As a hint, let's say it's a secret weapon that can beat you."

Having said that, Iruki turned to Nade and asked, "By the way, how about you? Surely you weren't just playing around during vacation."

"Ah, I was incredibly busy. I'm studying alchemy these days. I was supplementing some magic needed for that field."

Alchemy was also a major branch of magic, but it wasn't a field taught in magic schools. Alchemy was a vast discipline, and the Alchemy Foundation separately trained alchemists.

Iruki was worried. In the end, Nade had focused on areas disconnected from the curriculum during vacation.

"Will you be okay? If you're going to become a magical engineer, a mage certification would be more advantageous."

"Of course, but I also want to learn material science. Function starts from form, and the beginning of form is the prime matter. I thought I should know the basics of alchemy."

A voice from the dormitory supervisor came from the corridor.

"The entrance ceremony will begin. Students, please gather at the central event hall."

---

All students from Class 1 to Class 10 gathered in the training ground.

Shirone looked for Alpheas on the platform, but for some reason, he wasn't there.

"Huh? I don't see the principal?"

"Six months suspension. A temporary principal will come starting today. I don't know who it is, but I hope they'll go easy on the studying."

Nade closed his eyes and prayed. While his dream was to become a magical engineer, he first had to graduate from magic school, so having classes become more difficult was unwelcome.

When the newly appointed principal appeared on the platform, murmuring sounds could be heard from various places.

Iruki's face became serious.

"Oh no... of all people, that person is the principal."

"Huh? Do you know who it is?"

"Jerome Olivia. Former principal of the Royal Magic School. She's probably a certified second-class Great Magician."

Shirone observed Olivia carefully. She looked much younger than her age and was, above all, beautiful. Teachers were positioned on both sides, and they were all unable to hide their tension.

'What an impressive person. A Royal Magic School principal...'

Olivia waited for the students' murmuring to subside before beginning her speech.

"Hello. I am Jerome Olivia, who will be taking on the principal position starting this semester. Though it's a temporary position, I promise to do my best to teach the students during my term."
