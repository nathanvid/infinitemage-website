Cheers and applause erupted. Since someone who had served as principal at the nation's top educational institution had come, the students' expectations were higher than ever.

"I have long heard of Alpheas Magic School's reputation, so I have no intention of greatly interfering with existing policies. However, modern magical society pursues high efficiency and practicality. Pragmatism. This is the seed I wish to plant during my tenure as principal."

The implication was that Alpheas Magic School had been conducting classes disconnected from practical application until now. The students might have bristled, but since a Great Magician said so, they had no choice but to accept it.

"This is serious. I knew this would happen."

Iruki, who had attended the Royal Magic School, had sensed it from the moment he saw Olivia.

He had heard that she had retired from the principal position over the years, but he had no idea what wind had brought her here.

Similar remarks emerged among the Class Four students.

"I had a feeling, and sure enough. Spirit's prediction was right. We're going to be worked to death starting tomorrow."

"I heard her disciples are coming here too."

"I know, I read that too. One of them is Dante, right?"

Shirone listened intently to their conversation. It seemed many students already knew during the break that Olivia would be taking over as principal.

"Iruki, what is Spirit?"

"An academic journal published by the Faculty Council. Most magic school students could be called Spirit subscribers. It covers graduation exam trends, the latest popular magic, and issues happening at schools."

"I see. Do you read it too, Iruki?"

"Are you crazy? What do I care what other schools are doing? I go my own way."

Shirone also asked Nade.

"What about you?"

"I used to borrow friends' copies sometimes, but I don't read it anymore these days. Since I'm going to be an engineer anyway, I'm not that interested."

Iruki said, "Still, if it's Dante, the school will be turned upside down. He's practically the kingdom's number one student at the student level."

Kingdom ranking number one. Shirone couldn't even imagine the weight those words carried.

What kind of student could he be? No, what kind of feeling would it be?

To be first in the entire nation.

On the way back to the dormitory after the entrance ceremony, Iruki asked, "Shirone, what are you going to do? It seems like it'll be hard to see Principal Alpheas today."

"Everyone will be busy since it's the first day of school. I'm just planning to go during lunch break after morning classes tomorrow."

Shirone had mountains of questions to ask Alpheas. How much was known about Heaven's existence, and what was the story behind the Labyrinth of Time and Space? But today wasn't a good time. Promising to meet tomorrow, Shirone returned to the dormitory.

Early in the morning, Shirone joined his friends and entered the classroom to attend Class Four's historic first lesson.

About half the seats were already filled. Since he had always arrived first to class in Class Five, this felt different.

As much as Shirone was nervous, the Class Four students were also subtly keeping an eye on Shirone's group.

Especially Shirone, who had risen from Class Seven to Class Four in just half a year—an unprecedented case—always occupied first place in the students' interests.

It wasn't that there had never been students as outstanding as Shirone in the school's 50-year history. However, such outstanding students were assigned to high classes from the beginning, so Shirone's case could be called unique.

Shirone felt strange seeing people who had been his seniors until yesterday become his classmates. In contrast, Nade and Iruki naturally waved their hands and found empty seats to sit in.

"Finally here. Good to see you."

A hand suddenly appeared in front of Shirone's eyes. Looking up, he saw a boy with a round chin and a good-natured expression smiling.

Chris Boyle, ranked first in Class Four. He was a student who specialized in summoning magic.

True to being a boy known for being a model student, his appearance was impeccable. His collar was buttoned so tight it seemed to choke his neck, and his hair was neatly parted in a 2:8 ratio.

Shirone clasped Boyle's hand and said, "Good to see you too. Though it's not 'finally'—I barely made it up here."

"Haha! You don't need to be so modest. This is the last gateway to the advanced classes. Now it's time to appeal yourself rather than be modest."

Though it was advice given with good intentions, there was a definite sense of looking down on Shirone. But this too was probably one of Boyle's ways of appealing himself, as he had said.

"Thanks. Let's get along well from now on."

"Yeah. Though I don't know how long we'll be together."

"Huh? What do you mean?"

"What do you mean what? Obviously I'm talking about applying for the graduation class."

Class Four could apply for the graduation class at any time. This year, Amy had taken the lead first, followed shortly by Seriel. With a total of eight students having entered the graduation class so far, only two spots remained.

"Usually applicants flock in around the second half, but unusually, Senior Amy challenged too early, so there aren't many spots left. It's first come, first served."

Students perked up their ears at Boyle's words. From Class Four onward, performance wasn't particularly important. It was a game of watching whether to push forward to the graduation class or solidify one's foundation a bit more.

Of course, no one applied for the graduation class out of impatience.

Once you moved to the graduation class, you had to consider that there was no time to polish your fundamentals. Moreover, the shock of failing even the annual graduation exam was known to have a greater impact than expected.

In reality, while 60 percent of those who passed the graduation exam succeeded on their first attempt, only 20 percent of the entire magic school passed on their second attempt.

Based on such data, students were carefully considering advancing to the graduation class.

Boyle asked, "What about you? You're naturally thinking of proving your worth in Class Four and taking one of the remaining two spots, right?"

Shirone had discussed this issue with his friends last night too. And they had concluded it was premature.

Although he had scored over 80 points in all subjects in Class Five, it was merely improvisation to pass the exams.

Since there was a way to pass the graduation exam directly upon entering the graduation class, the calculation was that solidifying fundamentals for about half a semester wouldn't be a loss.

"No. I'll stay in Class Four until this semester."

This was unexpected for Boyle. He had naturally assumed that Shirone, who had risen to Class Four in the shortest time, would challenge to break records.

Was it a deception tactic? That didn't seem to be his personality. In any case, having one strong competitor give up wasn't a bad thing.

"Then there's nothing to be done. Anyway, let's work hard. Iruki, Nade. Please take care of us too."

"Yeah, well... I don't know how hard we'll work though."

Iruki spoke in a bothersome tone. The students intuitively sensed that all three of them would not advance to the graduation class.

Since they wouldn't have made such a decision without reason, it became an opportunity for others to reconsider as well.

It wasn't coincidental that the person who greeted Shirone's group first was Boyle, Class Four's number one.

This too was part of Class Four's power game.

As such, Azelio Pandora, ranked second, was in a bad mood.

When there was Amy as the number one, all students were merely second place, so there was no need to worry. But currently, the score difference between first-place Boyle and second-place Pandora was only one point.

As Boyle's conversation was winding down, Pandora stealthily approached Shirone and raised her hand.

"Hello?"

Nade made a groaning sound. The fact that he, everyone's friend, was disgusted was enough to understand her personality.

She was famous as an oddball in the advanced classes. A girl who thought she was the most amazing person in the world.

Shirone knew this fact too. But seeing her live self-centeredly without a single friend also seemed lonely.

"Hello, Pandora. We're in the same class now. It feels a bit strange."

"Hoho, how does it feel to take classes with a beautiful woman like me?"

Pandora leaned forward and sent flirtatious glances. In such cases, even Shirone had no choice but to lose face.

It wasn't that her appearance was ugly, but her heavy makeup was burdensome. Just smelling the powder made his heart feel strange. This was probably related to Pandora's specialty being fragrance magic.

"Oh my, look how red your face is. You don't need to be embarrassed. Let's be close from now on."

Whether she had planned this approach, Pandora's blouse had two fewer buttons fastened than usual. In that state, when she bent over, he couldn't tell whether he should close his eyes or just keep looking. Either seemed like rude behavior.

"Hey, what's all this? Shirone already has someone," Nade said, covering Shirone's eyes. And for his friend who couldn't see ahead, he took a peek inside Pandora's blouse instead.

Pandora was too annoyed to care about the male students' gazes.

Shirone's "someone" was none other than Karmis Amy.

When she was in the advanced classes, no student could even voice being accomplished.

Whether in grades or looks, she was superior in everything. The reason for sending flirtatious glances to Shirone was also to prove that given the opportunity, she could make him her man.

"Hmph, I know he's dating Senior Amy too. But you can't even meet anyway. Besides, she'll pass this graduation exam and leave school. Shirone needs a new woman. A sophisticated and intelligent woman like me."

Pandora subtly gathered her treasured chest.

"Anyway, it would be good to choose your line well. I'll catch up to Boyle soon. If you join my line, I'll treat you well."

Iruki, who had pulled Shirone away, waved his finger.

"Aren't you being too dismissive? We're the Shirone line."

"Hohoho! Since it's your first time, enjoy it to your heart's content. You'll learn that Class Four isn't easy. Well then, Shirone. See you later."

Pandora sent a kiss with her hand and returned to her seat. Shirone's mind was already confused before the first class even started. But thanks to this, he could get a sense of how Class Four operated.

Boyle and Pandora, ranked first and second, were aiming for the graduation class, with other students below them watching the situation.

Shirone thought giving up on the graduation class this time was the right decision. He had no intention of avoiding competition, but he didn't want to have emotional fights with friends over the narrow gap determined by first-come-first-served.

He resolved that if he could achieve remarkable growth this year, next year he would apply first like Amy.

The first three periods passed smoothly, and while waiting for the fourth period's mental theory class, a teacher entered with three transfer students.

Students who regularly subscribed to the Spirit magazine recognized them and began murmuring.

Victor Sabina.

Bonifar Closer.

Airhine Dante.

They were graduates of the Royal Magic School in the capital Bashka and currently the most talked-about students in the kingdom.

Especially Airhine Dante was a genius among geniuses, talented enough to be called the next Great Magician even among active mages.

"Now, now! Everyone quiet. These are transfer students who will be taking classes in Class Four starting today. They'll introduce themselves, so please welcome them warmly."

Dante, who went up to the podium, looked around at the students. His first impression was 'shabby.' To his eyes, which had enjoyed the most cutting-edge trends in the capital, everything looked rustic.

Dante fixed his gaze on Boyle. He looked like a mama's boy for sure, but was staring back with eyes so confident it was spine-chilling.

'Is that kid Shirone? No way, that can't be right.'

It was different from the impression of Shirone he had heard from Olivia. He didn't know about looks, but at least it wasn't that kind of atmosphere.

On one side, a girl with heavy makeup was sending flirtatious glances, and while her face was pretty, her ridiculous thick makeup was unbearable to look at. If she went around like that in the capital, she would be perfectly suited to earn the stigma of being a tavern woman.

"Dante, what are you doing? You need to introduce yourself."

Dante put aside his thoughts and opened his mouth.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Airhine Dante. Let's get along well."

The introduction ended with that.
