title: Chapter 228 - Where Is Shirone? (3)

If any other student had introduced themselves like this, there would have been jeers, but Dante was the exception.

The students had no choice but to keep their mouths shut, their pride telling them that he was already famous enough through magazines—what need was there for introductions?

After Sabina and Closer finished their introductions, class began.

The mental philosophy teacher was a 60-year-old philosopher named Carman who had obtained a certified 8th-grade magician qualification.

He had a decent reputation in Creas, but the class itself was rather boring.

"Today we'll learn about the algorithm that distinguishes between individuality and stubbornness. We want to be different from others. But simply being different from others isn't necessarily individuality."

Dante's group was already unenthusiastic from the start. This was a subject that ended around 400th place in the Royal Magic School rankings.

Closer, who was sitting with his chair tilted back in a slovenly manner, spoke up.

"This class is damn tedious. So what if it's individuality, so what if it's stubbornness? You live according to how you're made. How old are we to be studying mental philosophy?"

Dante wasn't interested in the class either. What piqued his curiosity more was the student called Shirone.

Having met with Olivia since morning, Dante had received a special mission from her to crush a child named Shirone.

Since this was his specialty, Dante had gladly accepted.

He didn't know who Shirone was, but until now, he must have been walking around with his nose high in the air. But from today on, he planned to make it so that he couldn't even lift his head.

'But this is strange. Why isn't he first place?'

If a second-grade Great Magician had given a direct order to crush someone, that person should naturally be taking first place in at least the advanced class. But the one in first place was some mama's boy.

Then who exactly was Shirone?

Dante's gaze swept over the students. Then his eyes fixed on one boy.

It was Mercordain Iruki.

'Right, that bastard was here too.'

When he was attending the Royal Magic School, a rivalry had almost formed between them, but it fell through when Iruki transferred schools.

Time had passed, he had become the kingdom's best, and Iruki wasn't even featured in magazines, so the gap had clearly widened. No, in fact, he thought that all the students here couldn't even reach the toes of Royal Magic School students.

The Royal Magic School had no class distinctions. There were only rankings from first to last place.

Starting from 30th place, called the magical barrier, students were given the qualification to take graduation exams, and currently Dante's group ranked 31st, 32nd, and 33rd.

Dante was confident he could pass even if he took the graduation exam right now. But his goal was solely first place.

Within the top 30, there were even 32-year-old students. Even if their skills were inferior, their experience of attending school for over 20 years couldn't be ignored, so he planned to prepare thoroughly and graduate with the highest grades.

When you enter one of the five prestigious schools, the Magic Association gives you ten graduation tickets. Alpheas Magic School also produces ten graduates annually using those tickets.

But the Royal Magic School gets ten additional tickets on top of the existing ten as a privilege for being the kingdom's best school.

With the capital's large population and the added merit that two-thirds could pass the graduation exam, it was natural for aspiring magicians from across the kingdom to flock there.

Ultimately, the 30 graduating class students from Alpheas Magic School and the top 30 from Royal Magic School were on different levels.

Just being assigned to Class Four based on the cutline of 30 students was something that hurt Dante's pride.

Anyway, he first needed to see who this boy called Shirone was. Since no student seemed particularly special, Dante asked the girl sitting next to him.

"Hey, who's Shirone?"

"Huh? Sh-Shirone? That kid sitting at the very end over there. But why Shirone?"

Dante didn't even bother to reply and turned his head toward Shirone. Surprisingly, it was the boy sitting next to Iruki. Also, he was one of the people Dante had thought definitely couldn't be the one.

"Hmm, he looks like he studies well. But he doesn't particularly look strong, does he?"

Closer and Sabina were also examining Shirone.

"Keke, obviously just a bookworm. Since it's a country school, looks like all he does is bury himself in books. I'm already bored to death. At this rate, when are we going to do practical training?"

"His fashion sucks but he's handsome. His personality also looks calm—typical Unlocker type."

"Hmph, if he's going to compete with Immortal Function, he should go into the mountains and practice meditation instead of coming to magic school."

Immortal Function was certainly rare, but it wasn't an absolute measure for gauging the level of magic.

This was evident from the fact that among the five nationally certified first-grade magicians, only one was an Unlocker.

Carman's mental philosophy class was heading toward its end.

"When you think of any idea, the more difficult it is to put that thought into practice, the more it can be called individuality. Also, if it easily draws agreement from others, it can be called conviction. The problem is when the difficulty is low and it can't draw agreement either. That's what we call stubbornness."

The students nodded, and Dante dozed off.

"From now on, you'll have to think about many things. Individuality is good, conviction is good. But don't fall into stubbornness. Something others cannot do, yet something that draws agreement—if such an idea occurs to you, that thought can be considered correct."

The bell signaling lunch time rang. The students applauded at the thought of being able to rest, and Carman left satisfied.

"Guys, I'll be back then."

Shirone hurriedly packed his bag. Since lunch time was the only time he could meet Alpheas, time was tight.

"Will you be okay? Not eating lunch?"

"It's not like I'm starving for just a day or two. Who knows, maybe the headmaster will buy me something delicious."

"Sure. Anyway, do well and come back."

"I might be late, so tell the teacher for me."

While the students prepared to go to the cafeteria, Closer raised both arms and yawned lazily.

"Phew, is it over now? Damn. Just one class and it's this boring. How are we supposed to endure half a year here?"

"Still, we have practicals in the afternoon, so it might be somewhat better. Dante, Dante. Wake up. It's lunch time."

Dante, awakened from sleep, got up rubbing his eyes.

"Ugh, what kind of class is a sleeping pill? Anyway, let's get started. Since we've come to his turf, it's only polite to greet him first."

Dante looked back at Shirone with sharp eyes. But no matter where he looked around, he couldn't find him.

"What? Where did he go?"

Just as Dante was about to move, Boyle and Pandora blocked his path. Just as he had done with Shirone, Boyle extended his hand first.

"Nice to meet you. I've heard your reputation. I'm Chris Boyle."

"Boyle, huh. What rank are you?"

Boyle straightened his shoulders as if he'd been waiting for this and said.

"First place. I'm the highest in the advanced class."

As expected, Shirone wasn't first place. Why hadn't his master said anything about Boyle? If she was going to unleash a beast like Dante, shouldn't she at least target first place?

"Then what rank is Shirone?"

Boyle felt bad that the kingdom's top star was concerned about someone named Shirone. But thinking that showing emotion would mean losing, he smiled.

"Shirone moved up this semester so he doesn't have a rank yet. But he's definitely promising. You could say he's my rival, though it looks like I'll be moving to the graduating class."

Dante stared blankly at Boyle's still-extended hand.

"Sorry, but I've never heard your name. In other words, I don't understand why I should shake hands with you. Are you saying I should bow down just because you're first in the advanced class?"

Boyle's face flushed red. He hadn't intended it, but he had somewhat expected a similar situation.

"I-I'm a classmate. I meant we should get along..."

"Classmate? So you're saying you and I are on the same level?"

Feeling a chilling coldness from Dante, Boyle took a step back. Having competed countless times to reach first place in Class Four, he wasn't adapted to this kind of low-level provocation.

"What's your major?"

Boyle thought he shouldn't be ignored any longer and lifted his head arrogantly.

"Summoning magic."

"Puhahaha!"

Closer, who burst into laughter, suddenly approached and struck Boyle's abdomen. Boyle, whose feet lifted a span off the ground, crashed down on his knees with a thud. Even in his breathless state, he couldn't believe what had happened to him.

"Sc-school violence is... Guk!"

Closer's soccer kick struck Boyle's stomach. Though he enjoyed fighting unlike a typical magician, this time he almost felt sorry for hitting him.

A seventeen-year-old acting like the world was ending after getting hit once? As expected of the countryside, they were all boring kids.

Dante looked down at Boyle, who was spitting.

"Wait for now. I'll line you all up under me soon enough."

The atmosphere in the classroom turned cold. No one dared to challenge Dante's group, who had revealed their true colors within just one hour.

Sabina approached the flustered Pandora and brazenly critiqued her appearance.

"What's with your makeup? As expected, the countryside is different. Do you go to bars at night by any chance?"

Pandora's face turned bright red. Though she was bold enough to be second to none, this kind of humiliation was a first for her.

Sabina's hand caressed Pandora's cheek.

"Hoho, you'd better not move. My hands are sharp, you know."

Pandora couldn't budge. Sabina's hand was soft, but her words weren't lies. A cold chill was circulating.

"Let's see. What should I do with this feisty little thing..."

Iruki, who had been watching, intervened.

"Cut it out. We're not kids."

Sabina frowned and turned around. But before she could speak, Dante walked over.

"It's been a while, Iruki."

"What, how do you know me?"

Veins bulged on Dante's forehead. Though they hadn't faced each other in conversation back then, there had been quite a commotion about their rivalry.

There was no way Iruki didn't know this fact. He was definitely ignoring him without knowing his place.

Nade intervened to lighten the mood.

"Wahaha! Let's not fight. What's the point of fighting on the first day of the semester? We're going to study together from now on, so we should get along. Right?"

From Dante's perspective, it wouldn't be good to make an enemy of Iruki either. He had no intention of getting along, but this was the Mercordain family.

Dante stopped paying attention to Iruki and looked at Nade.

"Where's Shirone?"

Shirone had gone to Alpheas. But without knowing Dante's intentions, Nade wasn't one to tell him obediently.

"Shirone? Aha, Shirone's famous! But I'm quite popular too. How about being friends with us instead? I'm the president of the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society..."

At his time-wasting tactic, Closer immediately jumped out and swung his fist. Nade's upper body leaned back, and the fist barely grazed past him.

It happened in an instant, as if they had choreographed it.

'Ho, look at this bastard?'

Closer's eyebrows rose. Dodging by a hair's breadth without even blinking was proof of being accustomed to fighting.

Dante snorted and said.

"For someone who smiles, your body is completely in combat mode."

"Uwaa, you scared me. Why are you suddenly doing that?"

Nade had an expression that said he didn't know what had just happened.

"Hmph, never mind. I don't know what you're scheming, but I have no business with a coward like you."

Dante had no choice but to ask Iruki.

"Hey, you know, right? Where's Shirone?"

"Why are you looking for Shirone?"

"Just to say hello. School life is going to get tough from now on. You're not going to say you don't know like that coward, are you? The great Mercordain."

"Of course. Shirone is over here."

Iruki pointed at his feet. Dante, who was looking at the floor, frowned and asked back.

"What, on the first floor?"

"No. Somewhere on this planet."

Leaving those words behind, Iruki left the classroom with Nade. Dante was angry enough for his ears to turn red.

"That bastard..."
