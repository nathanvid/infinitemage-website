title: Chapter 229 - Where is Shirone? (4)
date: 2025-08-30

They asked other students about Shirone's whereabouts, but only received answers that they didn't know. While they could wait for him to show up, they figured it wouldn't hurt to look around the school, so they decided to search for him directly.

When they actually walked around, the facilities were surprisingly decent, contrary to their expectations. The campus area was spacious enough to compare favorably with the Royal Magic School. But it still wasn't a place that felt welcoming.

When they couldn't find Shirone anywhere they went, Sabina grumbled.

"Honestly, what's so difficult about just telling us where he is that they make us search for him directly? He must be pretty well trusted, huh?"

Closer burst into laughter.

"Puhahahaha! Country bumpkins are always exceptional when it comes to loyalty. They have no skill but strut around putting on airs with stuff like that."

"But Iruki is here too."

At Dante's words, Closer's laughter stopped. Even he thought it was strange that Iruki was here.

"I don't get it. Why is the Mercordain family stuck in the countryside like this?"

"He used to go to the same school as us. I heard he either got expelled or dropped out, caused some trouble and disappeared, but who would've thought we'd meet him here."

Dante decided not to think about it too complexly. He was going to have to clash with him eventually anyway.

"It doesn't matter. The person Master chose is Shirone. Let's crush that bastard first, then think about it."

Arriving at the cafeteria, Dante watched the scene of upperclassmen and underclassmen meeting and exchanging greetings.

It was a common sight in the class system, but having climbed up from the bottom at the Royal Magic School, he let out a hollow laugh.

"Seriously, what era are we in to still have a class system? This Alpheas guy is really old-fashioned."

"Right. From what I saw in the magazine, they only have the ranking system in the graduating class."

"Keke, that's why the kids have no spirit. Did you see how that tofu-like bastard from earlier went down with one punch from me?"

Dante left the conversation behind and walked toward the students. Since the system was like that anyway, shouldn't he enjoy the privileges?

At Dante's appearance, the students all turned to look at once. Was there any magic school student who didn't admire Dante? It was simply amazing that the kingdom's top star attended the same school.

Dante put his hands in his pockets and waited for quite a while. When there was still no reaction, he frowned and spoke.

"What are you doing? A senior has arrived and you're not greeting me?"

The underclassmen who had been staring blankly finally came to their senses and bowed.

"Ah, hello! Senior!"

Even though it was child's play, receiving greetings felt pretty good.

While examining the faces of the underclassmen, Dante spotted a woman who looked at least two years older than him.

Normally, she should have been around Class Four, but the sight of her standing alongside snotty kids was pathetic.

"Hey, you."

"M-me, senior?"

Class Six's Maria pointed to herself.

"Yeah. How old are you?"

"I'm nineteen."

Dante made a look of disdain. Being so meek, she was just getting older while hanging around with kids.

"You know Shirone, right?"

"Senior Shirone? Yes, I know him."

"Where is he now?"

"W-well, I'm not really sure about that."

He hadn't expected anything from a woman like that from the beginning.

Thinking he should go into the cafeteria, he started walking when Closer stepped forward like a relay runner taking the baton.

To Closer, who boasted numerous romantic conquests at the Royal Magic School, Maria was perfect prey.

"Oho, cute. What's your name, pretty lady?"

"It's Erlang Maria."

An unpleasant emotion rose on Maria's face. Having attended magic school since childhood, she had no complaints about the class system, but when age differences were emphasized like this, she couldn't help but feel offended.

"You know how to frown? This senior treatment is really messed up."

"Ah, I'm sorry."

Closer was satisfied. Why were the students at this school so naive? Gaining even more confidence, he grabbed Maria's wrist and brought his face close.

"Nothing to be sorry about. Instead of that, let's hang out. How sexually frustrated must you be staying with those green kids? I may look like this, but I'm really solid where it counts."

Maria's face flushed red. She couldn't stand it and tried to shake off his hand, but Closer's grip was too strong.

At that moment, Mark approached and grabbed Closer's wrist.

"Please stop, senior."

Closer's expression crumpled. The transmitted force was considerable. Since magicians who trained their bodies were rare, he looked up to examine him and indeed found someone with a build that matched his own.

"What kind of underclassman grabs a senior's wrist? This school is completely messed up."

"What are you doing, senior? Harassing a female underclassman should also be against school rules."

"Harassment? This isn't harassment, it's natural push-and-pull between men and women."

"Maria is uncomfortable."

"Do you know how to handle women, kid? Women of that age, when you pull them strongly, they pretend they can't resist and fall into your arms. If not, then what? Were you thinking of doing something about it yourself?"

Mark let go of the thread of reason.

"This bastard, I've been watching and watching..."

"Puhahahaha! This brat is completely pissed off! Don't tell me you actually like her? Is that why you're restless, afraid she'll be taken?"

Mark wanted to shout honestly that yes, he did, but he swallowed the words that rose to his throat. He still didn't measure up to even Shirone's toes. But someday...

"Maria is my friend. And I don't let anyone who insults my friends slide. Whether they're seniors or teachers, I don't care. If you want to be respected, do something worthy of respect."

Closer's expression changed. With the laughter gone from his face, he looked like a complete cold-blooded person.

"Really? Then I'll make you respect me. You'll be rolling on the ground."

The two moved apart without agreement. Since using magic within the school was taboo, the watching students naturally became tense. But neither Closer nor Mark entered their Spirit Zone.

"As expected, men should use fists. Don't you think?"

"For someone like you to say the word 'man' - how ridiculous."

"Keke, you're really trying hard to die. Come on, kid."

Closer took a boxing stance and beckoned with his hands.

Mark, provoked, rushed in. Against someone who had harassed Maria, he didn't want to think about consequences.

At that moment, Closer stepped back.

Mark was furious. Acting like he was ready to fight right now, what was this backstep about?

Mark pretended to attack the face, and when Closer ducked his upper body, immediately struck up at his abdomen with his opposite fist.

'Got him!'

An 80-kilogram giant swinging with full force - he definitely wouldn't be able to stand up.

"Kugh!"

But it was Mark whose expression crumpled.

His fist tingled as if he'd hit a rock. This wasn't a human body. He must be hiding something in his stomach...

At that moment, Closer's counter exploded against his face.

Mark's pupils shook violently.

'What is this?'

The nerves connecting his head and body were paralyzed by a single blow.

Being interested in martial arts, he had sparred with martial artists who were known for their strength, but this was a different quality of power.

"Puhahahaha! You're completely weak! How about it? Do you feel like respecting me now? Huh?"

When he came to his senses at Closer's voice, he was crouched on the ground getting kicked.

"How is it? Fun? Is it fun being trampled like a dog by your senior?"

Even amid the pain, Mark couldn't bear the frustration.

His mind was getting up and counterattacking, but his body couldn't move a finger.

Maria ran over and hugged Mark.

"Please stop! He'll die at this rate!"

"Hehe, what are you talking about? Who are you trying to frame? This bastard clearly hit me first."

Maria realized why Closer had yielded the first attack.

At this rate, the problem wasn't just getting beaten up - Mark might face disciplinary action.

"I'm sorry. I'll apologize. I'll even kneel and beg, so please stop."

Dante stepped forward to resolve the situation. Making a big deal on the first day would be troublesome going forward.

"Listen up, underclassmen. From now on, when you see us, make sure to bow 90 degrees. Look at this guy and remember clearly what happens when you look down on seniors."

As Dante's group left, the students let out sighs of relief. The kingdom's top star seemed to be the best at instilling fear as well.

Maria looked over Mark with tears welling up.

"Mark, are you okay? You idiot, why did you do that?"

Mark had already regained consciousness. The situation of being held in Maria's arms felt like a dream, so he had just been spacing out. But he didn't want to worry her, so he quickly sat up.

"I'm fine. This much is nothing."

While Maria checked if anything was broken, Mark glared at Dante's group walking away.

"Those guys are really dangerous. What are they trying to do acting so recklessly?"

"I don't know. I heard they're disciples of Principal Olivia, so they're probably acting tough based on that. Kingdom's top star my ass. They're complete thugs."

With the change of principal, everything was changing. The students were treating today's incident as just a happening, but Mark, who had once been like them, had an intuition. What happened to him today might just be a prelude to the major incidents that would unfold.

Walking alongside Olivia through the corridors of the advanced class building, Thad felt like dying.

Having received special orders from Alpheas to help the new principal adapt, he was stuck playing secretary.

"Um, Principal. Let's have a meal first before making rounds. Our school's food is famous for being delicious."

Olivia didn't even pretend to listen and looked through documents. Yet somehow she could walk this fast - it was amazing.

"Why are there so many 8th-grade teachers in the school? What era are we in that we can teach students with 8th-grade teachers? Students known throughout the kingdom are even given unofficial 9th-grade recognition these days. Graduating students even reach official levels."

Thad wanted to ask what a magic aspirant who wasn't even a magician was trying to accomplish by making a name in the kingdom.

But recalling his master's advice to approach this with the mindset of spiritual training, he tried to persuade with kind words.

"Most 8th-grade teachers are experts in fields other than magic. For the students' character education, we've assembled faculty with professional specialties like philosophers, artists, and technicians."

"This is a special purpose school. Miscellaneous education should be left to families, and magic should be the top priority. Who are the current stars at Alpheas? There's Airhine Dante at the Royal, Miko Raina at Oris, and even Pleuron Municipal, which isn't even one of the five prestigious schools, has Exion Kavael, a star the students are crazy about."

"But Principal, how many kids like that are there in the kingdom?"

"That's not important. What matters is that they exist. It's important that other schools have them but we don't. With this kind of thinking, no wonder this school has been at the bottom for nearly 10 years. Aren't the teachers here too complacent?"

Olivia asked but didn't give time for an answer.

"The faculty needs tension too. A school that enters the five prestigious schools needs brilliant young teachers positioned throughout. Even Olifer Siena wouldn't be in the top tier by Royal Magic School standards. Honestly, isn't Romy Etela the only teacher in the entire kingdom who could be considered truly capable?"

Thad wanted to sew Olivia's mouth shut. He believed that sincerely teaching students was what made an excellent teacher. But she was trying to rank even teachers by ability.

"We need a bit more. Or we need to develop them. Oh, holding regular seminars would be good too."

Letters began to be carved into a notebook floating to Olivia's right. It was something called dot writing, a type of speech magic - the ability to transcribe voice into text.

Her speech was so fast that he wondered if she was using ultra-speech (a technique of speech magic users to pronounce at ultra-high speed), yet the writing speed didn't fall behind.
