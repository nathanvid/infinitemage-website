Olivia suddenly stopped walking as if something had occurred to her.

"This won't do. I'll personally observe the afternoon classes myself. I'll inspect everything starting from Class Ten, so please prepare for that."

"Yes, understood."

Thad answered as if under hypnosis. Since she was trying to raise the school's reputation, it wasn't something he could resent.

As Olivia began walking again, Shirone approached from across the hallway. Since it was too early for him to be returning from lunch, Thad tilted his head curiously and asked.

"Shirone? What's the matter?"

"Oh, hello."

Olivia observed Shirone as he approached. The boy Alpheas had said resembled him. But the Alpheas she knew wasn't like this at all.

Well, she had met him when he was in his early thirties, around the time he had become a broken man after losing his wife. So could this boy be what Alpheas was like before marriage, when he was called the light of the Mirhi family?

"So you're Shirone."

"Yes, nice to meet you."

"I see. Isn't it lunchtime right now?"

"I was trying to meet the headmaster. I went to the headmaster's office but he wasn't there."

"Of course not. I'm the headmaster starting today."

"Ah, I'm sorry."

When Shirone realized his mistake and became flustered, Thad quickly intervened to smooth over the situation.

"Master is probably in his private study. If you go right from the central building, there's an annex. Try going there."

Thad gestured with his eyes for him to leave quickly. Realizing the situation, Shirone bowed his head and retraced his steps.

"Phew! I almost suffocated to death."

Once he left the building, Shirone took a deep breath.

The aura emanating from a Second-Rank Great Magician was unlike anything he had ever experienced.

He had felt pressure from Arcane too, but Olivia surpassed that to the point where he didn't even realize he was feeling pressure. Only after leaving her domain did he realize he hadn't been breathing.

After calming his mind, Shirone went to find the annex as Thad had directed. When he grasped the door handle and knocked, Alpheas in comfortable clothing welcomed Shirone.

"I was waiting for you. Come on in."

Shirone looked around the modest interior of the annex and fixed his gaze on a portrait hanging on the wall.

Alpheas pointed to her and introduced her.

"My wife, Erina. You've heard about her, haven't you?"

"Yes. Hello."

Shirone bowed politely to the portrait. Somehow it felt like the right thing to do. Though Alpheas raised an eyebrow at the peculiar behavior, he didn't tell him to stop.

"Well, you must have a lot you want to talk about. But before I hear your story... are you perhaps hungry?"

"Actually, a little."

"I made mushroom soup. Let's eat together."

The two sat facing each other and ate. Though Alpheas was equally curious, he said nothing and waited. The beginning was always the hardest part of any story.

"Headmaster, I went to Heaven."

Clang, the utensil dropped. Alpheas, who had spilled soup below his lips, slurped it up and wiped his beard.

He couldn't believe it, but looking at Shirone's face, it was true. It wasn't the expression of a traveler who had visited an amazing place, nor that of an explorer who had made a great discovery.

"When you say Heaven..."

"I'm sorry. It just happened that way. Canis..."

After hearing the whole story, Alpheas remained silent for a while. Particularly, the fact that Arcane had gone to Heaven was news to him.

Come to think of it, he had always been a person full of secrets. Though he had chosen evil over good, he was someone close to nihilism.

"Headmaster, I'm curious about something. How did Miro come to take on that responsibility?"

Alpheas realized what Shirone was guessing. But his thoughts didn't change. It was already in the past and couldn't be undone. One person being unable to escape the past was enough.

'Gaold...'

Michea Gaold. Now one of the kingdom's top First-Rank Great Magicians, but to Alpheas he still remained in memory as his student, as the pure young man he once was.

"Shirone. Don't try to learn anything. This is a transnational matter. The moment you step foot in it, even your life will become twisted."

"But what if Miro...!"

"What would change just because you know?"

Shirone closed his mouth. Even if he knew, there was nothing he could change. Even now, this world was being maintained by the power of just one person.

"Headmaster, if Heaven's army breaks through Miro's Labyrinth of Time and Space..."

Alpheas shook his head.

"Ever since Miro blocked Heaven's army, the think tanks of various nations have been preparing for a long time. Do you understand, Shirone? Nothing will change. You have dreams. Don't ruin your life by being bound to untouchable truths."

It was the same words as before going to Galliant Island, but now Shirone could understand those words. Just briefly dipping his feet in had nearly ruined not only his own life but his friends' lives as well.

"Yes, don't worry. I felt it to my bones too."

Alpheas smiled benevolently.

"Even I am impressed by Ataraxia. In ancient times, angelic abilities were called dragon-slaying magic. When you get the chance later, look into the history of the dragon race. Dragons have a much longer history than humans, so you'll be able to learn more about angels."

Shirone had unexpectedly obtained good information. Until now he had only thought about the relationship between Heaven and humans, but when he thought about it, it was a matter involving the entire world.

'I should study the histories of other races later too.'

After finishing that thought, Shirone asked.

"Should I take responsibility for this power?"

"Hehe, Shirone, there's no such thing. No one knows what results your choices will bring about. You must think and judge for yourself."

"I keep hesitating."

"Hahaha! That's also a natural phenomenon. At the moment Ataraxia opens, it's fair to say you're stronger than me."

Alpheas's words weren't false. If there was no exaggeration in Shirone's story, then at the moment the Ataraxia magic circle opened, it would have power that even a certified Fourth-Rank magician couldn't stop.

But Shirone wasn't happy.

He knew what Alpheas's precondition of "at the moment Ataraxia opens" meant.

Theory and reality were strictly different. Remaining defenseless for one minute while Immortal Function was open was no different from offering one's neck to be cut in actual combat.

"I understand what you want to say. It's true that it's still a power too overwhelming for me to handle. From now on I'll train hard to make it truly mine."

"Yes. You've gained a good connection. It's yours. Embrace it and think about it countless times."

"Yes, thank you."

After confiding in Alpheas, his heart felt much lighter. It might have been passing responsibility to an adult, but when he thought about it, that was the natural order of things.

What Shirone could do was become an adult as quickly as possible and share their responsibilities.

When Shirone returned to school, Alpheas locked the door and returned with a serious expression.

It was new information about Heaven that had come in after a year.

When Miro returned from Heaven, she had accepted the reality that she had no choice but to save everyone through her sacrifice.

But Shirone was different. He had fought Heaven.

Struggle creates enemies, but therefore it also creates allies.

As payment for struggling in Heaven, Shirone had gained companions. The world would pay attention to this achievement with a different meaning than Miro's.

"Dear, honestly I'm frightened. Now even I don't really know. Who that child is."

Ataraxia. He had said irresponsible words, telling him to embrace it and handle it himself.

But it wasn't in his nature to give advice when faced with power he himself couldn't handle.

"My blood boils for the first time in a while. You might find this hurtful to hear, but I wonder if the mistake of letting you go wasn't so that I could meet this boy someday."

He didn't think that only he could teach Shirone. But the failures of his youth would certainly become nourishment for Shirone's development.

"What do you think? Would it be alright if I were a little more greedy?"

Erina in the painting was smiling.

Arin walked pleasantly through the flower garden behind the advanced class where autumn flowers were in full bloom. Though it was a place no one visited because the open space was small, she liked it all the more for that reason.

Even though most of the classes covered things she already knew, the school she was attending for the first time in her life was much harder to adapt to than expected.

"Arin, were you waiting?"

Canis came running with rice balls tucked in his arms. Though Alpheas had paid the tuition so room and board were free, he didn't want to receive the school's help. Using the dormitory while refusing meals might have been childish stubbornness, but Alpheas didn't stop him.

This was the school that had killed Arcane. Even without bringing up their young age, the heart wanting to maintain loyalty to their master was admirable.

"Let's eat. I'm not sure if the seasoning is right this time."

Arin sat in the flower garden and picked up a rice ball. At first it had been so salty she could barely eat it, but the taste was gradually getting deeper.

Canis chewed his rice while talking.

"I wonder if I should get a job at night."

"Canis, the headmaster is even giving us allowance money. Being stubborn is kind of stupid too."

"I know. But it's over the moment I think it's natural. I'll accept what I have to accept unavoidably, but I need to refuse step by step. He was master's enemy, so I can't pathetically raise a white flag."

Canis added one more thing.

"I'll use it if it's really urgent. But I don't want to lean on it."

Canis's words weren't wrong either. More than anything, the two weren't yet comfortable mingling with the other children in the cafeteria.

"Tch, not here either. Where the hell did he go?"

Dante's group entered the flower garden. Canis had heard through rumors who they were. But he didn't want to care. Whether they were stars of the kingdom or whatever, it was just childish.

"Should we ask?"

Dante also spotted Canis and approached. When he actually observed the two up close, it was pitiful enough to bring tears to his eyes. He had thought they might be on a date, but they were crouched down eating rice balls miserably. They were definitely being ostracized. Every organization had outcasts.

"Hey, are you guys Class Four?"

Dante asked, but no answer came back. He had clearly spoken loudly enough for them to hear, yet their eyes seemed to see nothing but rice balls.

Closer said.

"Don't you even have money to buy food? Does this country school accept the impoverished too? The level is so low I can't stand to watch."

Arin glanced at Closer. Then, as if someone might steal it from her, she moved her jaw like a squirrel.

She had known since childhood that people who disparage food are the first to pick up a fork.

Closer was fed up. The slender girl had an incredible appetite.

"Are you possessed by a glutton? Eat slowly. I'm not going to steal your food."

Still no response came from the two. Dante felt frustrated. Perhaps because it was the countryside, he kept seeing spectacular scenes he couldn't even witness in the city.

"Are the kids bullying you so you're hiding to eat? You guys really live pathetically. Just act crazy and fight back. Don't just take it."

"So what?"

Canis couldn't stand it anymore and lifted his head. What he hated most in the world was someone bothering him while he was eating.

Looking into Canis's eyes, Dante realized his mistake. A realist? No, it was hostility circling from somewhere deeper than that. This guy had crossed a forbidden line.

Finally getting a reaction, Closer flexed his fist.

"What? Acting pretty tough, huh? Do you need to taste my fist to come to your senses?"

"Cut it out, Closer."

Dante stopped him. He had a feeling that if he messed with him, they'd both end up looking dirty. Even in this situation, there was no sign of tension to be found in Arin.

Did that mean she was confident? Or had she perhaps lived on a battlefield surrounded by corpses?

"Hey, are you the best in Class Four?"

"The best? The best is Shirone, isn't it?"

'Is this guy Shirone too?'

Dante fell into thought. Following Iruki, now Canis had also pointed to Shirone. He finally felt like the thread was unraveling. Master Olivia had pinpointed it exactly.
