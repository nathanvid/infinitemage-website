title: Chapter 231 - Where is Shirone? (6)

"Where is Shirone?"

"How would I know? Isn't he in the cafeteria?"

"I wouldn't be asking if he was there."

Canis had a good idea where he might be. He probably went to Alpheas to report on Heaven's affairs.

If it meant getting rid of these annoying guys, he wouldn't mind telling them, but he wasn't in the mood.

"What are you going to do once you find Shirone?"

"Crush him, of course. They said Shirone was the best, so if I break that guy, you'll have to fall in line under me too."

"Hahahaha!"

Canis burst out laughing at the absurdity. At this, Closer glared and approached him.

"You think this is funny? Don't you know who we are?"

"Do you know who Shirone is?"

Dante spoke up.

"I know. He's the guy who reached the level of Immortal Function. But so what? If you think being a mage is some kind of enlightenment job, you're mistaken. Magic is strictly a killing technique."

Canis had no disagreement with that. After hanging around with the sage-like Shirone for so long, it felt refreshing to hear something sensible for once.

But if Shirone really were just some goody-two-shoes softie, he would have been trampled by Canis long ago.

Shirone was different. That was the key point.

"I'm really worried about you, so I'm telling you this - you'd better not mess with that guy. Looking at you reminds me of my old self."

"Hahaha! So what, just because you lost means I'll lose too? I see now, you're just a loser."

Canis remained calm. His years hadn't been beautiful enough to waste emotions on cheap provocations.

"It's not about winning or losing. How far have you ever fallen?"

"I don't know what you mean, but I've never fallen once. Unlike you."

"Then go ahead and try. You'll experience what it feels like to be trampled to the very bottom you can imagine. Kekekek."

Dante's face flushed red. Even in the capital Bashka, no one had dared to disrespect him. Not because this place was impressive, but because they were ignorant. He shouldn't have bothered with these country bumpkins from the start.

"Interesting. I'll break you. When that time comes, you'll have to kneel before me too."

After Dante led his group away, Canis completely lost his appetite. He couldn't understand why there were so many self-centered nobles.

Arin spoke while chewing her food.

"Surprising, Canis. You readily admitted that Shirone was the best."

"I hate troublesome things. I don't want to attract attention in a place like this either."

"Well, if it's Shirone, he'll handle it just fine."

Canis pursed his lips. Even if he didn't know, he thought Arin, as a member of the Heaven faction, would show at least some concern.

"That may be true, but... doesn't that sound a bit too irresponsible?"

"Mm, no. I really think Shirone will be okay."

After sucking on her fingers, Arin looked at the rice ball remaining in Canis's hand.

"Are you done eating that?"

"No, this is..."

Canis defensively pulled the rice ball toward himself. He should have finished it quickly. Getting into a fight with those annoying guys was going to cost him a meal.

"Oh, I'm done. You can have it."

"Hehe, thanks."

Her hunger somewhat satisfied, Arin regained her composure and asked.

"Come to think of it, Shirone has quite a lot of enemies."

"But he has just as many allies. He won't be lonely."

Canis looked up at the bright sky. Even at this very moment, Harvest was analyzing the Books of Light and Darkness brought from Heaven.

Having inherited Arcane's legacy, there was no need for haste. Wouldn't this kind of leisure be nice sometimes? They had been running frantically until now.

"Slowly, slowly is fine."

"Yeah, let's do that."

Canis smiled and looked back at Arin. Then, shaking his head as if he couldn't help it, he patted her back.

"Eat a little slower."

**Combat Simulation (1)**

Lunch time ended and the advanced class integrated lesson time returned. As usual, the instructor was Ethella, and the location was the training ground with the Image Zone.

About ten minutes later, Shirone came running in breathlessly.

Having gotten used to moving by teleportation during the vacation, he hadn't realized that jogging here would be this exhausting.

"Ah, Teacher Ethella. I'm sorry. I tried to make it on time."

"That's alright. I heard from Nade. Go in and prepare for class."

Dante's group realized it had been impossible to meet Shirone during lunch time from the start, and their faces soured like they'd eaten something foul.

They should have said something if that was the case. What was this about training people like dogs?

"Now, everyone. It's good to see you all. I see some new faces this semester. Dante, Closer, Sabina, welcome to your transfer to Alpheas Magic School. Everyone give them a round of applause."

Dante raised the corner of his mouth in bewilderment. He had expected something from the class taught by Romy Ethella, who was famous even at the Royal Magic Academy, but the impression was quite different from his expectations.

She had a gentle face with large glasses and her hair was casually tied up. He could understand that she was a monk, but her teaching style reminded him of the nanny who had taught him when he was seven years old.

What was even more bewildering was that the children were seriously clapping along with these childish instructions.

"Then let's begin class. Lower classes will focus intensively on Omnidirectional Transformation and sequence magic, while upper classes will proceed in order: Mental Beating, Targeting, and sequence magic."

Sabina whispered to Closer.

"It seems like the graduating class and advanced class lessons are completely different here."

"Right. I was expecting practical training, but it's just as boring."

The one thing Sabina had looked forward to when transferring was Ethella's class, who had earned the Triple designation.

When you achieve grade 6 or higher in three different fields, you receive the title of Triple. Ethella was a sacred figure in education who had achieved grade 6 in magic, martial arts, and enlightenment (Spirit Zone).

But when she actually attended the class, not only was the speech childish, but the curriculum was also nothing but boring basic training.

Sabina raised her hand and asked.

"Teacher, don't we do other training? I want to learn Sniper Mode."

"That's a subject that goes into major classes, so we don't teach it in advanced classes."

"But if it's Teacher Ethella, you could definitely teach us. Honestly, I transferred here just to take this one class."

"The process of finding your aptitude is what advanced class is for. Even Sniper Mode is ultimately Omnidirectional Transformation. It won't be too late to learn applied techniques after thoroughly building your fundamentals."

"Mmm, then couldn't we do it privately? If I could say I learned from Teacher Ethella, I could brag to my friends."

It seemed that for students from the capital region, which teacher you learned from was also a major source of pride.

If that was Bashka's culture, it wasn't her place to interfere, but in any case, Alpheas Magic School's regulations meant she couldn't teach anything outside her assigned subjects.

"I'd like to, but there's the issue of fairness. If you really want to learn Sniper Mode, improve your skills as quickly as possible and enter the graduating class."

A clear voice was heard from the training ground entrance.

"That's not necessarily the case. Being too rigid about orthodoxy can also be a factor that hinders development."

Olivia walked in. Behind her, all the advanced class teachers followed like attendants.

Thad and Siena, who along with Ethella were called the three pillars of Alpheas Magic School, were also visible.

The two who made eye contact with Ethella shrugged their shoulders as if to say "does this make sense?" It was an action only possible because they were outside Olivia's line of sight.

"Hello, Headmaster."

Ethella greeted with a monk's courtesy. Olivia returned the greeting with a nod and looked around at the students.

"I was watching from the entrance, and I saw a student wanting to learn applied techniques. If a student's passion is for learning, shouldn't a teacher be able to teach them sufficiently?"

"But according to school regulations..."

"Ah, I know about that. But as time passes, regulations change too. Having a renowned master like you as a teacher and then making them teach nothing but basics all the time. This also seems inefficient to me."

Because Ethella was such an outstanding master, Alpheas had deliberately asked her to teach the children basics in advanced class.

But Olivia thought differently. While basics were important, realistically, to elevate the school, there needed to be visible results too.

"These children each have different personalities. Trying to integrate that under the name of 'class' from the start is futile. If you see potential for development, you should actively support it."

Thad and Siena, who never missed a chance to argue, kept their mouths firmly shut now.

Being a certified Grade 2 Great Magician was that kind of position.

The standards for classifying mage grades were unified worldwide. This was called the Line - a massive human resource network system that managed all mages.

There were three Lines in the world, and among them, the channel with the broadest bandwidth was the Red Line overseen by the Magic Association.

All mages who were classified as certified or uncertified and received designations from Grade 1 to Grade 10 belonged to the Red Line.

The teachers under the Red Line system knew how impossibly difficult it was to reach Olivia's position.

Certified Grade 1 usually numbered fewer than five per kingdom, so even becoming a Certified Grade 2 mage meant you were called the pinnacle of the Red Line.

Therefore, no matter how eccentric the philosophy, if someone had risen to Certified Grade 2, there was no way to refute them.

Ethella spoke. As a master, she was part of the Red Line, but as a monk unrelated to the mage human resource network, she had more freedom to speak than other teachers.

"The advanced class students still lack understanding of magic. I think it's important to find not just individuality that's simply different from others, but your own unique individuality that others cannot follow. That's why I pay more attention to the fundamentals."

The teachers' faces turned ashen. Meanwhile, Thad and Siena quietly gave thumbs up. Despite her gentle appearance, Ethella was solid inside, as expected.

"Is that what you think? Fine. Then how about we verify how faithful to basics the students taught by Teacher Ethella are, using the Lifting evaluation method?"

Ethella had heard of the Lifting evaluation method at academic conferences. It was said to be more objective than other evaluation methods and was an effective test for gauging the overall level of Spirit Zone.

Shirone's group felt their hearts race at the teachers' power struggle.

"Whew, not just Teacher Ethella, but the Headmaster is no joke either."

"Right. At this rate, something's really going to happen, isn't it?"

"No way. Even Teacher Siena can't say a word."

Ethella nodded confidently.

"Very well. It's not to brag, but I'm proud that the fundamentals of the students I've taught are second to none compared to any school."

"Then let's begin. Is there any student in Class Four who has done Spirit Zone Lifting training?"

Only Dante's group raised their hands. While Alpheas had refused due to unproven effectiveness, the Royal Magic Academy had officially adopted it as a subject a year ago.

"Good. Then since everyone must be curious about the transfer students' abilities, would Dante come out and demonstrate?"

"Yes. It would be my honor, Headmaster."

While Dante walked to the Image Zone, Olivia instructed a teacher to set the target's sensitivity to maximum.

Ethella explained lifting to the students.

"The Lifting test is designed to comprehensively evaluate Spirit Zone functionality. You hold a target with strong repulsive force within your Spirit Zone. Since it bounces in unpredictable directions depending on changes in the Spirit Zone's density, specific gravity, and form, the longer you can maintain it, the better your Spirit Zone functionality."

Dante positioned himself in the center of the Image Zone. When he snapped his fingers, a spherical target materialized above his head.
