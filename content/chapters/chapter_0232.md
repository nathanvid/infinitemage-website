The moment the target entered the Spirit Zone, it trembled as if electrocuted.

Then, following changes in mental state, it began bouncing in unpredictable trajectories.

As the target tried to escape the Spirit Zone, Dante employed the four-way type to secure the space.

Then, through momentary concentration during mental pulsation, he quickly pulled it back.

When the target returned to center, it thrashed around again.

Each time this happened, Dante skillfully transformed the shape of his four-way type, controlling it so the target couldn't break free.

As time passed, the target's movements became faster and its trajectory changed in bizarre ways.

In some sections it vibrated as if trapped against a wall, while in others it shot out over 10 meters at full power.

Just watching made the students tense.

When it flew so fast that even the longest-range target type couldn't catch it, sounds naturally escaped.

"Whoa!"

At that moment, Dante expanded his Spirit Zone with sequence magic.

The target type's range stretched out, once again trapping the target. Without fail, mental pulsation occurred and pulled the target back.

The onlookers were speechless at the almost acrobatic Spirit Zone operation.

After a minute passed, Olivia called for a stop.

"Enough. I think this demonstration is sufficient."

Dante pulled the target over and floated it above his head before releasing his Spirit Zone.

The students watched in fascination.

Even for just a moment, the technique of moving the target in the desired direction was at a level impossible with ordinary mental power.

"This is the Lifting Test. Class Four students should be able to maintain it for about a minute. Now, shall we have other students try the demonstration? I heard there's a student named Shirone..."

Boyle raised his hand.

"I'll do it."

It was a strategy to embarrass Shirone, but when an unexpected student raised his hand, Olivia felt awkward.

Lifting for one minute was far above the Class Four average.

Even Dante, who had practiced since the test was introduced, would struggle with two minutes.

"I'm Class Four's number one. I'm confident."

Olivia's eyes lit up.

It was disappointing that it wasn't Shirone, but a comparison with the advanced class's top student would provide objective data to pressure Ethella.

"Good. Since it's your first time, think of it as getting a feel for it."

Boyle confidently walked to the Image Zone.

While climbing the stairs, he glared at Dante, but Dante just shrugged and stepped aside.

With students watching tensely, Boyle's lifting began.

When the target entered his Spirit Zone, it rebelled strongly.

It was much harder than expected. It felt like a rubber ball bouncing inside his skull.

True to his talent as the advanced class's top student, he maintained the lifting, but the cycle of pulling with mental pulsation became noticeably shorter.

Eventually, the transformation speed of his four-way type couldn't keep up with the target's speed, and the target escaped his Spirit Zone.

"Hah, hah."

Boyle breathed heavily in succession. He thought it was decent for a first attempt.

But the students' expressions were grim.

His pupils shook with shock when he checked the electronic board.

21 seconds.

It was less than half of Dante's performance.

With practice, he might achieve higher scores, but even so, maintaining it for a minute seemed difficult.

"Damn it! Damn it!"

Boyle returned to his seat with his head down.

He couldn't face Ethella.

His failure had proven that Ethella's student had weaker fundamentals than Olivia's student.

However, Olivia didn't rejoice, nor did she scold Ethella.

Though it began with childish motivation, as someone who had devoted her life to education, she was sincere when it came to school matters.

"Boyle did well too. Twenty seconds on the first attempt is quite respectable. I'm not someone who ignores fundamentals. What I want to say is that no matter how basic something is, you must have the skills. In an era when students nationwide are taking specialized courses, if you only stick to orthodox methods, you'll be left behind."

Hearing this, it made sense.

For the first time, the teachers wondered if they might be wrong.

Had they unknowingly fallen into complacency?

To keep up with changing times, fresh stimulation was needed.

Perhaps that was exactly why Alpheas had personally gone to great lengths to bring Olivia.

Olivia gave the students a knowing smile.

When the cold-impressioned woman smiled, her beauty seemed to shine even more.

"Now, you all want to try too, right? Then let's make today a free lesson practicing lifting. Since it's the first day, getting familiar with the sensation is important, so try anything. Let's begin the practical session."

The students rushed over like they'd received new toys.

Olivia didn't leave her spot but watched the students' practice with satisfaction.

Thinking there would be nothing to do today, Ethella headed toward where the teachers were.

Approaching Thad and Siena, she let her shoulders slump.

"I'm sorry. It really is like hitting a rock with an egg."

Thad comforted Ethella.

"Haha! Don't think like that. Still, it was refreshing that Teacher Ethella said what needed to be said. Besides, Dante is the kingdom's number one. Boyle's fundamentals are definitely not lacking."

Siena felt similarly.

Though there were differences in level, if Boyle had practiced lifting, it would have been a good match.

Considering that summoning mages mostly shine after their thirties, Boyle, who reached the top of the advanced class at a young age, was also a rare genius.

"What worries me is what happens next. Since Dante won, the headmaster's influence will strengthen. If we're not careful, the school's foundation could be shaken."

"Come on, surely not. What the advanced class can do is limited anyway."

With the graduating class present, high-intensity training couldn't be applied to advanced class students.

Most importantly, the curriculum wasn't that half-hearted.

But Siena was uneasy.

She felt there was some intention behind Olivia's actions using Dante as her front.

The three watched the students practicing lifting.

Once they adapted somewhat, most students did reasonably well, with Boyle and Pandora showing skills befitting the leading group.

Siena pointed to Shirone's group.

"Huh? What are those kids doing?"

Shirone, Nade, and Iruki had teamed up to practice lifting with a single target.

At this novel idea, the other children stopped practicing and watched.

When one person trapped the target and it bounced out, another would catch it and resume lifting.

"Oh ho, oh ho! This is interesting."

When Nade clumsily trapped the target, Iruki's Spirit Zone came in and intercepted it.

The next moment, Shirone snatched the target and moved it to the rear.

The two people without the target came running fiercely, and Shirone held on for quite a while before Nade seized control again.

Now all the students were staring at Shirone's group.

Though they'd been troublemakers since Class Five, it was also enviable to see them enjoying themselves without the pressure of competition.

"But wait, was Shirone's Spirit Zone that big?"

"Oh, you're right. He's improved tremendously!"

The Class Four students immediately noticed Shirone's change.

Since special training during vacation was common sense, no student would be without results, but Shirone's development was truly remarkable.

Dante's group couldn't ignore Shirone's Spirit Zone either.

"Wow, it's really big. At that level, he'd be in the top 30 rankings even at the Royal Magic School."

"Tch! Even so, it's just about the same as Dante's. Since he probably can't beat Dante in lifting, he's going around doing it like that. Typical loser mentality, right, Dante?"

Dante didn't respond. He just watched Shirone's group practicing lifting.

"Heh, rookies. Shall we show them a proper demonstration?"

Closer headed to the Image Zone with Sabina. The children naturally made way.

The two's lifting skills were not inferior to Dante's at all.

Especially Sabina demonstrated a whirlwind technique by instantly twisting her mind. As the target wrapped around glamorously and returned just before escaping, students exclaimed in admiration.

Thanks to this, the teachers could also confirm the transfer students' abilities.

Olivia's students were certainly impressive.

Even Thad, who had been most troubled by her, had to acknowledge it.

"Truly the kingdom's greatest talents. What do you think, Teacher Ethella? As a Zoner, how would you evaluate Dante's skills?"

"Hmm, it's hard to evaluate based on lifting alone, but he certainly has distinctive aspects. Kids these days really have excellent magical sense."

Siena said.

"But it's also regrettable. The talent is tremendous but feels light, you could say? I get the feeling that kids now view magic as a tool to show off."

"Since magic has been part of life from a young age, it's natural. The mage's spirit, passion? That seems to have disappeared. They only pursue flashiness and fame. In that sense, Shirone, Iruki, and Nade have classical aspects, hoho."

Ethella smiled while looking at Shirone's group.

There was once a time when magic was children's dream. But for kids in the metropolitan area, it seemed like an accessory to make themselves stand out more.

There would be no way to stop the changing flow of the times.

Still, it was nice to see Shirone and his friends, who retained pure passion.

When the back-and-forth game ended, Shirone came down from the Image Zone panting.

After working up a sweat, he felt refreshed.

As Shirone wiped his sweat with a towel handed by a female underclassman, Dante approached.

Though no one announced it, the students stopped practicing and fixed their gazes.

It was the moment when the two finally faced each other.

Dante stared intently at Shirone's face.

'Is this the guy my teacher told me to break?'

Judging by Shirone's appearance alone, no one would think he was strong.

It was why Closer and Sabina weren't nervous even after receiving Olivia's special orders.

But fights aren't won by looks.

Creating an undefeated myth at the Royal Magic School was due to both natural talent and a thorough nature that never let his guard down.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Dante."

Dante extended his hand first.

The children were surprised by his completely different attitude from what he'd shown in the classroom. The person most hurt in his pride was Boyle.

But unaware of this fact, Shirone took it as goodwill and grasped Dante's hand.

"Yeah, I've heard a lot about you."

"Of course you have. I've heard about you too. You're an Unlocker, right? Perfect for crushing. Oh, of course I don't mean to disparage you."

"Haha! Yeah. Let's get along well from now on."

Despite the aggressive provocation, Shirone didn't seem offended.

Dante tried to analyze his inner thoughts but gave up, thinking it only made things more complicated.

"Anyway, let's get along. If you have any questions, feel free to ask anything. There are no teachers or friends when it comes to learning. If you want, I'll teach you properly."

"Huh?"

When Shirone tilted his head, Dante became displeased.

No matter how much of a country bumpkin ignorant of politics he might be, if a rival who could threaten his position transferred in, it was natural to be wary. He couldn't believe this reaction was from genuine ignorance.

"Don't know what I mean? Your major is Photon Magic, right?"

"Yeah. Photon Magic is my specialty."

"Mine too. My nickname is Shining Boy. Don't you know?"

Only then did Shirone realize his mistake and stuck out his tongue.

"Ah, sorry. I really didn't know. I don't read academic journals."

"You didn't know?"

Dante was the kingdom's most promising talent in the photon field.

It was a fact that any magic school student would know, yet claiming ignorance because he didn't read academic journals was just an excuse.

"Your provocation is quite something. You're not lacking as my opponent."

"No, I really didn't know. I wasn't doing it on purpose. I'm really sorry."
