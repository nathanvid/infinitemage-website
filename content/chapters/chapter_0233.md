Dante could no longer tolerate the humiliation.

"This is ridiculous! Do you think I'm that pathetic? You expect me to believe that?"

"What Shirone said is true."

Iruki approached and put his arm around Shirone's shoulder.

"I understand you're upset, but Shirone really doesn't know you. He's been at the magic school for less than a year. This is only his second semester."

Dante's jaw dropped as his lips protruded. Since the semester had just started, it had only been about six months at most. Yet for someone's Spirit Zone to match his own in size was something beyond common sense.

'No, no way. These guys are ganging up on me.'

Dante forced a nonchalant expression and snorted.

"Ha! So you're telling me that everyone knelt before someone who's only been learning magic for six months? Are all the students at this school nothing but trash?"

The students bristled, but since Dante's words were true, they couldn't bring themselves to argue.

The only person qualified to respond was Shirone himself.

"Why are you talking like that? We don't learn magic just to beat someone."

"Haha! Well said. Though I haven't seen your skills directly myself."

Regardless of why magic was born, modern society operated on infinite competition. In such circumstances, discussing essence was either the idealism of the weak or the pretense of the strong.

Having decided it was the latter, Dante stood on his tiptoes to look down at Shirone.

"I'll expose all your lies. Look forward to it."

After classes ended, the advanced class teachers gathered in the meeting room.

Olivia was meticulously recording the problems she had discovered while observing the school throughout the day. She then placed a new sheet of paper on the desk and began the meeting.

"Since we toured together, there's no need for lengthy explanations. At this rate, the school's ranking will fall even further. I believe drastic measures are necessary."

The teachers had already expected Olivia to drop a bombshell. But the question was what kind of bombshell it would be.

"I've considered various methods, but frankly, there are no suitable alternatives within the advanced class system. However, there is one method. We can borrow the graduating class system."

The teachers' eyes widened. Before the feeling of "surely not" could cross their minds, Olivia announced:

"I request that the combat simulation training ground, Ihan-beun, be opened to the advanced class."

Thad slammed the table and stood up.

"Principal! Ihan-beun is too dangerous. Even the graduating class uses the training ground under teacher supervision."

"What exactly is dangerous about it? There's no need to coddle the students so much. Even if Ihan-beun is close to real combat, we can lower the synchronization rate."

Olivia was serious, so Thad calmly tried to persuade her.

"Your approach has merit, Principal. It's true that we may have overprotected the advanced class children. However, I dare say the graduating class isn't that low level. They're competing intensely enough, and I think practical training should be limited to those students."

"How can the upper level be intense when the middle level isn't? Students go from advanced class to graduating classâ€”where else do we bring graduating class students from? With that kind of thinking, we can't achieve innovation. We need to think differently."

Ethella spoke up.

"But then what about the graduating class? They use Ihan-beun every day."

"I understand there are two Ihan-beun training grounds. Add the Colosseum graduation exam site, and that's three places. With proper time management, at least one of them could be utilized by the advanced class."

The teachers fell silent. The graduating class was the graduating class precisely because they conducted practical training through Ihan-beun. While it wasn't impossible to apply it to the advanced class, they had to consider the intangible value of the graduating class's pride.

Most importantly, it went against Alpheas's educational philosophy, which had served the school for decades.

As the silence lengthened, the atmosphere became unclear whether they were having a meeting or a fight. Olivia, who had been patiently waiting for opinions, nodded.

"Fine, I see how it is. You won't listen to me because I'm temporary? Do you still consider Mr. Alpheas the principal in your hearts?"

"Oh, no! Absolutely not...!"

"You can be honest. It's natural for humans to feel that way. But don't be mistaken. I, the current faculty council inspector and former principal of the Royal Magic School, didn't come to this school just to fill Mr. Alpheas's gap. Mr. Alpheas knows this better than anyone, which is why he personally came to me and pleaded."

Thad was sweating profusely. As Olivia said, she was currently the principal. And the teachers had to acknowledge that fact.

But wrong was wrong. She wouldn't be here after six months. Since Alpheas's philosophy was the school's history and tradition, it had to be maintained.

"No one denies Ms. Olivia's reputation. I respect you from the heart as well. But such a sudden request is difficult for us too..."

"Follow what Ms. Olivia says."

All the teachers turned around. Alpheas, who had entered through the back door, was smiling. As the teachers' spiritual pillar appeared, Olivia showed displeasure.

"What's this? Are you monitoring me? I believe someone with full authority doesn't need Mr. Alpheas's permission."

"Of course not. I was just taking a walk when I thought I heard voices. Hehe!"

"Then please mind your own business, former principal."

"Before I go, I'd like to say something personal to my student. Thad, the school's principal is clearly Ms. Olivia. You must understand that fact well."

"I understand."

When Alpheas directly stepped in to drive the point home, the other teachers had nothing more to say. They had wondered if he had really transferred full authority to a six-month temporary principal, but now there was no doubt.

"Hehe! Well then, this idle old man will be on his way."

Olivia snorted. But she didn't sulk any further. It was something that needed to be clarified at least once.

When Olivia looked at Thad, he bowed his head after preparing himself mentally.

"I'll announce it to the advanced class."

@

A notice was posted on the advanced class bulletin board. It stated that integrated education would henceforth be conducted at Training Ground 27.

The lower classes were puzzled, but the upper classes, who knew what that place was, couldn't help but be tense.

Nade and Iruki also sensed that the situation was serious.

"That's where Ihan-beun is, right? Is this really okay?"

"We didn't expect it to end like this anyway. What does it matter? It's not like we'll die."

As Iruki said, they wouldn't die, but it was indeed dangerous.

Combat simulation wasn't like the war games of childhood where you made sound effects with your mouth.

"Still, I'm nervous. Are they really going to do this?"

"Who knows. Looking at the current principal's tendencies, it's possible. She did say she believes in practicalism. Anyway, let's go tell Shirone."

Nade looked around.

"Speaking of which, where did Shirone go? He didn't even eat dinner."

"He said he'd skip it. We're meeting at the research society tonight. He said he had business at the training ground."

"At this hour?"

"He said it would be awkward when it's quiet. This is the only time he has to practice."

"Don't tell me... Ataraxia?"

Iruki smiled meaningfully.

"Perfect time to sneak a peek. Let's go."

@

Shirone stood alone in the empty training ground. The reason he had come here, even skipping dinner, was to train Ataraxia.

The one-minute preparation time seemed unnecessarily long to him. Since magic circles weren't constrained by space, they could be used as siege weapons, but he wasn't about to jump into war, and actions that could cause mass casualties required the utmost caution.

'If I practice hundreds or thousands of times, I'll adapt. But probably only once a day at most.'

The inability to do repetitive training was another obstacle in training Ataraxia. But Shirone didn't give up. Hadn't he accomplished reading history books in the Ozent family library when he set his mind to it? Everything gained momentum, so if he walked diligently, he would find himself running at some point.

"Alright! Let's do this."

Shirone cast Halo. A circle with a one-meter diameter appeared before his eyes, absorbing countless concepts.

The multicolored lights rushing from the front were always a dreamy sight. After passing through a certain realm, multidimensional structures beyond the realm of understanding were carved, and Ataraxia was born.

Shirone looked at the target ahead and decided on his magic. If it was photon output rather than Photon Cannon, there would be no physical force, so he could use magic freely.

"Hey, Shirone...!"

The moment Nade and Iruki entered the training ground, a massive beam shot from the Ataraxia magic circle.

From above, the light was bright enough to make the training ground flash, and even students far away noticed the mountain beyond brightening and turned their heads.

Nade and Iruki's eyes widened. They could feel a thrill just from the light's output alone.

This wasn't a size humans could handle. It felt like witnessing a natural phenomenon brought right before their eyes. What could possibly remain where that light had passed?

Surprisingly, not a speck of dust rose. Iruki realized that the magic Shirone had cast was photon output. Cold sweat ran down his back. If it had been Photon Cannon, the cliff blocking the training ground would have vanished.

'As expected, you're amazing, Shirone. You need to be at that level for my finishing move to shine.'

Nade moved his legs awkwardly, like someone who had forgotten how to walk.

"Hey, Shirone. This is..."

Before Nade could finish speaking, Shirone collapsed with a thud.

Normally, some consciousness would remain, but since this was his only training session of the day, he had poured out all his strength.

"Shirone, Shirone! Snap out of it."

Nade helped Shirone up and patted his cheeks. Sometimes mages died from overexerting themselves with magic, so terrible thoughts flooded in.

Contrary to their worries, Shirone opened his eyes soon.

"Huh? When did you get here?"

"Are you okay? We've been here since you started using Ataraxia or whatever."

"Hahaha! You saw it? I was trying to save it."

Shirone pressed his hand against the ground and stood up. Though he was unsteady, it wasn't unbearable.

Iruki approached without taking his eyes off the target.

"The magic you used in Heaven was Ataraxia plus Photon Cannon, right? What kind of destructive power would that have? Now that I've seen this, I can't ask you to try it."

"Right. I probably won't have many occasions to use such powerful force in reality. Still, I want to keep refining it. The problem is it takes too much time."

"Not necessarily. Maybe you'll get a chance to use it in reality soon."

"Huh? What do you mean? A chance?"

Iruki looked at Nade. Initially, they had come to find Shirone just to vent, but as the situation developed, it was becoming interesting.

"Starting tomorrow, we'll be training in Ihan-beun. The principal decided on it."

"Ihan-beun? What's that?"

Iruki pointed to the sky.

"Virtual afflictions."

Nade added:

"A combat simulation system exclusively for Great Magicians."

@

Ten minutes before the advanced class integrated lesson began, the students' tension was higher than usual.

Training Ground 27 was an open area created by flattening a mountain, with the floor finished densely with small metal blocks.

Four steel towers stood along the outer perimeter, each appearing to be about seven meters tall.

The teachers supervising the education were Siena, Thad, and Ethella. The students were satisfied to receive instruction from all the popular teachers.
