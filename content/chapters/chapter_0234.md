Olivia arrived at the training grounds and stood before the students.

"Since this is our first class, I'll explain everything directly. I know the sudden curriculum change must be confusing. But mages must be strong. You should know something about the Two Thousand system. It's a device developed by Louis Jacobin, the pioneer of magical engineering—a system designed to enable real combat-like battles even in training situations."

To Nade, the name Jacobin sounded as loud as if it had been amplified through a megaphone.

He was the world's greatest magical engineer, the very person who created the masterpiece known as the Image Zone.

With the advent of the Image Zone, Spirit Zones became visible to the naked eye, and that system eventually evolved into the Two Thousand system.

While people praised the glamorous reputation of combat mages, who was it that raised those combat mages?

Without the devices Jacobin created, the level of mages would have stagnated for thirty years.

"Teacher Thad, please bring the master bracelets."

Thad brought two bracelets. Olivia put them on her wrists and showed them to the students.

"Here we have a red bracelet and a blue bracelet. Each bracelet has different functions, so don't switch them with your friends. The red bracelet converts the mage's condition into information, while the blue bracelet converts external conditions into information. These two sets of information are transmitted to the tower to create a virtual world. Let's try them on."

The students received pairs of bracelets. When they put them on their wrists, red and blue lights illuminated.

"Now I'll activate the Two Thousand system."

When the administrator activated the system, the ground began to shake as if an earthquake had occurred. The physical blocks laid on the floor changed height, creating a complex terrain that simulated a natural environment.

The students gaped in amazement at the virtual scenery they were seeing for the first time in their lives.

They had heard about it from graduating class seniors, but experiencing it firsthand was incomparably more realistic.

The virtual scenery was the urban district of Creas City. Though no people walked around, the landscape of hundreds of houses packed closely together was so realistic it could be mistaken for reality.

"The urban setting isn't ideal. Please change it to a different scenery."

The arrangement of blocks began to change. The blocks in the northeastern perimeter, covering a quarter of the total area, descended in unison.

Water filled the sunken area, creating a lake, and the surrounding scenery transformed into a forest centered around that point.

It was a pristine mountain area untouched by human footsteps.

"As expected of a prestigious school. Even for the Two Thousand system, creating a lake is difficult. Over 80 percent of natural features are physical blocks, but the scenery is entirely virtual. The blue bracelet receives information and transmits it to your brain. Therefore, if you remove the bracelet, only the physical blocks remain. Go ahead and look around. I'll give you about ten minutes."

The students entered the Two Thousand system in formation. Though no one had ordered it, their maintained formation showed they were tense.

These were common mountain sights, but even the rolling pebbles seemed fascinating. Shirone's group went to examine the lake.

When Nade touched a tree, the blue bracelet glowed and transmitted the texture.

"Amazing. This can't even be a physical block—is this really virtual?"

"The leaves look real too."

Shirone plucked a leaf. It didn't disappear but lay on his palm like a real object.

Iruki approached the lake, scooped up water with his hands, and drank it.

"How is it? Does it taste like water?"

"It's more than that—it actually quenches my thirst. Of course, it must be an illusion. My brain judged it as water. This is somewhat dangerous."

Shirone had the same thought. What if it were fire instead of water? Would the brain recognize the heat information and burn the body?

Since it wasn't real fire, perhaps it wouldn't go that far. But it was impossible to be certain.

Shirone looked back at Nade, who was knowledgeable about such things.

"Nade, this is..."

"Yes! It's similar to the mechanism of Spirit Zone! This is truly incredible! Louis Jacobin implemented human consciousness through mechanical devices."

If a biologist's dream is to replace human organs with artificial ones, then an engineer's ultimate goal is a machine that thinks like a human.

While still distant, Jacobin seemed to have at least succeeded in converting human consciousness into information.

"I heard there was tremendous opposition from the faculty when they decided to open the Two Thousand system to advanced classes. Now I understand why. You could actually die."

"Yes, you could die."

Olivia had approached them at some point.

"If we could die..."

"But don't worry. Except for graduation exams, we don't set the synchronization rate to 100 percent. Currently, the filter is disabled for demonstration purposes, but when you experience it, it will be around 50 percent. Graduating class uses 80 percent. These are regulations established by Kingdom Education Law."

Iruki said, "Even at 50 percent, it can't be considered completely safe, right?"

"You're surprisingly timid, Iruki."

"I don't want to be a fool who dies from charging in blindly."

Olivia stared intently at Iruki. He was once a child evaluated as equal to Dante.

But the Royal Magic School wasn't lenient enough to tolerate students' arrogance, and she remembered he had eventually dropped out.

'Now all that's left is a sharp tongue? How pitiful.'

Olivia looked around at the students and said, "Iruki is right. The Two Thousand system is dangerous. But it's a controllable danger. The Royal Magic School already conducts near-realistic training by freely adjusting synchronization rates from 1 percent to 100 percent according to student levels. I'm not saying to take risks, but rather that we can control them sufficiently."

They didn't need to apply high synchronization rates. Since it was education, practicing at appropriate levels would naturally improve combat instincts.

When the students returned to their positions, Olivia began the Two Thousand class in earnest.

"The bracelets I'm wearing are master versions, unlike yours. They're devices that can control various functions of the Two Thousand system. Let me show you what's different."

A red gauge sixty centimeters long appeared above Olivia's head.

"This is a percentage visualization of my mental power. Of course, you won't be able to see gauges during practical sessions. First, let me explain what role it plays. Teacher Thad, please summon a monster."

Master bracelets shared functions. Even if one teacher tried to endanger students, as long as other teachers wore master bracelets, the system was designed to prevent dangerous situations.

"Understood. But, well... which one?"

Faced with this situation like choosing a lunch menu, Thad decided to pass the choice along.

Since it was equally awkward, Olivia also pondered while resting her chin on her hand.

"Hmm, is this version 6.2?"

"Yes, it's the latest version. The information was updated ten days ago."

"Then demons must have been added. Let's go with a succubus."

The students' eyes widened.

"A, a succubus? You can really summon a succubus?"

Demons were powerful beings on a different level from monsters. They were found in closed spaces like ancient towers or underground labyrinths untouched by human feet, and the state prohibited entry to such areas unless you were a party of rank 6 or higher.

The prevailing theory was that the collective consciousness of ancient peoples was projected, given that gods appearing in mythology bore demonic characteristics.

The fact that no new demons had appeared in modern times, where individual personality was emphasized, also supported this theory.

Since concepts of good and evil were unclear in ancient times, unimaginable taboos were practiced.

The stimulation those people enjoyed was so intense that even modern warfare couldn't match it, and that fervor sublimated into what were called ancient gods—the demons.

Since the prevailing theory was that succubi also originated from orgiastic rituals, it was natural for curious students to be tense.

"Then let's begin."

Thad found the succubus's code name and transmitted the information to central control.

Light shot from four spires, and a translucent object shimmered in the peaceful scenery before a succubus materialized.

Students watched without even blinking. They had encountered this being in novels and myths rather than academic texts, so they had expectations, but contrary to what they expected, its appearance was horrific.

The naked female body was bruised blue-black, with hideous bat wings attached to her back.

She had deeply sunken eyes, a perfectly upturned nose, and such crooked teeth that her lips protruded even when her mouth was closed. Her corpse-like bluish lips added to the grotesqueness.

"Th-that's a succubus?"

The male students made disgusted expressions. No matter how beautiful the figure, the other hideous features evoked revulsion.

Olivia examined the succubus's face. She had received reports as faculty meeting supervisor, but this was her first time seeing it in person.

Seeing that the characteristics of the succubus she had defeated in her youth were properly captured, she nodded.

"Mm, this is acceptable. I was skeptical since data on demons is so scarce."

Olivia clapped to get the students' attention.

"Now, everyone. This is probably your first time seeing a succubus. This is what they look like. The monsters implemented in the Two Thousand system are updated based on information from countless explorers and scholars. This is my first time seeing the demon version too. Now let's see how well the dream ability is implemented."

When Thad switched to test mode, the succubus's appearance began to change.

Students stared with vacant expressions. Particularly the males—drool even leaked from their mouths.

A succubus with straight black hair, pale skin, and a pure face was smiling. Of course, she was completely naked.

"Um, Headmaster. There are still young students here, so this type is a bit..."

Thad spoke, but Olivia actually moved aside so they could see more clearly.

"Well, what do you think? Would you call this beautiful?"

Thunderous cheers erupted from the males.

"Wow! Amazing! Really amazing!"

"If classes were like this, I wouldn't get tired even if we did them all day!"

Olivia smiled prettily.

"Then you're all dead."

The hall became as quiet as if cold water had been poured over it.

"Regardless of appearance, the essence is demonic. What are demons? The ugly mistakes of humans who lived long ago. When you encounter a demon, there's only one judgment to make: Can you kill it or not? The moment you make any other judgment, your head will be rolling on the ground."

When Olivia nodded to Thad, the succubus returned to its original hideous appearance.

The children felt chilled at the thought that they had been momentarily enchanted by such a monster.

"There's a saying: What you see is your mind. A succubus's appearance can shake your Spirit Zone. To face demons, you need at least a rank 6 party. At that level, a moment's carelessness leads to annihilation. Whether a swordsman gets distracted or a surgeon rushes to the wounded, mages must not waver. Because we coldly monitor the situation, our companions can perform their duties at full strength. That's why mages are the party's top survival priority and must die last, even if death comes."

Students listened with concentration. This was the first class that candidly revealed what happened on the front lines.

This too was part of Olivia's practical education approach.

"How about it? This is the efficiency of the Two Thousand system. No matter how much you explain with words, there's a world of difference from seeing it with your own eyes. Of course, fighting demons is still far in your future. But Two Thousand combat is one of the graduation exam subjects. If you make such mistakes in the Colosseum, you'll be eliminated. Sending such mages to actual battlefields would only get their companions killed."
