Shirone took this to heart as well. Whatever profession a mage might pursue in the future, they must be able to protect both themselves and their companions. This was because they would only be given missions that ordinary people couldn't handle. If a mage merely sat at a desk shuffling papers, it would be far more efficient to hire a scholar instead.

"Then let's begin in earnest. Since testing with a succubus would be inappropriate, please call up a Dragon Tooth Soldier this time."

Thad had been waiting for those words and immediately dispelled the succubus. When he input the code for the Dragon Tooth Soldier, a steel-colored skeleton was projected into the Two Thousand.

The students burst into cheers again. The Dragon Tooth Soldier was a magical creature made from dragon fangs. It was so incredibly tough that physical attacks barely affected it, making it such a powerful monster that without a holy mage who had mastered Turn Undead, running away was considered the better option.

"I'll invite one of the teachers to demonstrate."

"I'll do it."

Thad stepped forward. Honestly, he didn't want to, but he couldn't send Siena or Ethella. He had no desire to watch a woman get beaten up by a Dragon Tooth Soldier.

"Though it's virtual, the information it processes is based on actual Dragon Tooth Soldiers, so you can consider this real combat. Let's go with a light synchronization rate of 50 percent. Is that alright?"

"Haha! Of course. Just 50 percent, no problem."

Actually, it wasn't fine at all. Even for a certified 6th-grade mage, a Dragon Tooth Soldier was a formidable monster. Even if only half the shock would get through, he couldn't guarantee his mind would hold up.

"Then Teacher Thad will receive an attack from the Dragon Tooth Soldier."

The Dragon Tooth Soldier approached with heavy footsteps.

'This is terrifying. Damn it.'

Thad waited with a grim expression. When the massive skeleton came right up to him and raised its relic-like sword, the students' eyes widened.

The presence was tremendous.

"Huh? Wh-what?"

The Dragon Tooth Soldier's arm fell at a terrifying speed.

As the virtual sword passed through Thad's body, the percentage gauge floating above his head dropped by 50 percent.

Thad strained to maintain a composed expression.

"As you can see, Teacher Thad's mental strength has been cut in half. This is because being slashed by the sword means death. Since the current synchronization rate is 50 percent, only half was deducted. When a mage receives a death judgment, the hologram passes through them. This is called 'penetration.' Now let me show you a defense judgment. Teacher Thad."

Like a skilled teaching assistant, Thad immediately cast magic. When he used Air Skin, his body was covered with a compressed air barrier, and the percentage gauge dropped by 1 percent.

Since it was a numerical representation of mental strength, the gauge decreased not only when taking attacks but also when casting magic.

"Now, let's receive the Dragon Tooth Soldier's attack."

The Dragon Tooth Soldier raised its arm and brought down the sword. This time it was different from the penetration judgment. The blade stopped as if firmly embedded in Thad's crown, and the percentage gauge decreased by 1.8 percent.

Olivia nodded with satisfaction.

"Truly impressive. With the 1 percent cost of Air Skin, you gained 48.2 percent defense. If you think of this as real combat, it means your mind barely wavered after taking a full-force blow from a Dragon Tooth Soldier. You can see how strong Teacher Thad is, can't you?"

All the students loudly answered "Yes!" If the destructive power was enough to reduce a certified 6th-grade mage's mental strength by 1.8 percent, then advanced class students would die instantly from just a graze.

Thad proudly puffed out his chest. There was no need to reveal that he had frantically deployed sequence magic just before being hit.

"When a hologram doesn't penetrate, it's called 'blocking.' Penetration and blocking. When these two judgments occur, mental strength is drained through antimagic and magical control techniques."

Magical control was a technique that blocked specific circuits in the brain, making concentration impossible.

The Spirit Zone was a phenomenon where the entire brain became active, so blocking even a portion of the cerebral network made concentration impossible.

When one circuit was blocked, the brain immediately rerouted through other pathways to transmit information.

However, since the magical control device also changed blocking paths at a rate of 20 times per second, a phenomenon occurred where thinking was possible but entering the Spirit Zone was not.

Of course, if one could surpass the 20-per-second blocking speed and even bypass irregular patterns, entering the Spirit Zone would be possible.

But the Magic Association's official position was that this was impossible unless one was a certified 2nd-grade Great Magician or higher.

While it was indeed an impressive technique, the students weren't interested in magical control.

It didn't harm the mind and was originally developed for use on criminals, so naturally, unless someone dreamed of becoming an engineer, they wouldn't find it interesting.

But they couldn't help but be frightened by the mention of antimagic.

"Headmaster, antimagic is rather..."

"Yes, I know what you're worried about. It's magic that damages the mind. But unless the synchronization rate is above 80 percent, there's no great danger, so don't worry."

Olivia firmly concluded and moved on to the next topic.

"Then let's move on to attack judgment. This is called 'pushing.' Teacher Thad."

Now it was time to attack the Dragon Tooth Soldier. But Thad couldn't help but smack his lips.

Without holy magic, he would need either physical force strong enough to shatter dragon teeth or firepower hot enough to melt them.

It wasn't impossible if he used his full strength, but he didn't want to show himself struggling in front of the students.

"Um, the Dragon Tooth Soldier is..."

"Ah, I see. Let me do it."

Thad stepped back and Olivia took his place.

Looking at the Dragon Tooth Soldier, she casually raised her hand and cast the holy magic Holy Cross.

Light burst from her palm and simultaneously a massive cross of light exploded at the Dragon Tooth Soldier's solar plexus.

The shocked Dragon Tooth Soldier staggered backward.

"This is pushing. Virtual information can't make your physical body be pushed back, but it's entirely possible with holograms. Monster death judgment also falls under pushing. Let me show you a demonstration."

Olivia slightly pursed her lips. A high-pitched sound leaked from between her sensually parted lips.

When she cast Holy Cross, a cross four times larger than before shattered the Dragon Tooth Soldier.

The students' eyes went wide at the spectacle of bones dancing in the air.

The teachers were equally shocked.

As befitting the highest authority in incantation magic, she had easily performed single-tone technique, an advanced skill of ultrasonic technique.

Siena watched her with complicated feelings. She had tried to hold out until Alpheas returned, but there was no way to stop the surging respect she felt.

"Impressive. Judging by the amplification, it must have been over 2,000 syllables."

"It took about 0.82 seconds. She read five pages worth of a novel in less than one second."

Ethella's vivid comparison sent chills down their spines.

Even trying to imagine it, they couldn't grasp just how fast that was.

"The basics of incantation are to reflect and speak. Not just pronunciation, but the speed of thought is terrifying."

"Yes, that's why S-class criminals have flame locks placed on them instead of magical control devices to prevent them from thinking at all. Of course, the headmaster isn't a criminal."

What was most surprising was that Olivia's mental strength gauge hadn't decreased at all even after casting magic.

It must have been a decrease within 0.1 percent. Smashing a Dragon Tooth Soldier seemed easier than breathing for her.

"This concludes the basic explanation of the Two Thousand. We plan to alternate between Image Zone and Two Thousand classes, so please check your schedules carefully. Class Seven will be set to 20 percent synchronization rate, and we'll increase by 10 percent steps, so Class Four will be at 50 percent. For reference, the graduating class is currently training at 80 percent, and the graduation exam is at 100 percent. If you have any additional questions, please ask now."

A Class Four student raised their hand.

"What happens if the gauge is completely depleted?"

"Good question. Look at Teacher Thad's gauge."

The students' eyes turned to Thad. Somehow his gauge was completely filled again.

"The mental strength gauge reflects a mage's mind in real time. It decreases when you take attacks and also when you cast magic. Of course, it fills back up when you rest. If it reaches 0 percent, light will emit from the two bracelets and the Two Thousand effect will disappear. Any other questions?"

"Um... is that really all?"

Olivia smiled with her eyes.

"Yes, that's all. Through Two Thousand practical training, you will be able to greatly improve your tactical and strategic understanding. Above all, the core function of the Two Thousand hasn't even appeared yet, so there's no need to be nervous already."

The teachers' expressions darkened.

The reason they had limited it to only the graduating class despite acknowledging the Two Thousand's efficiency was because of problems like this.

"No matter how strong monsters are, they're merely dead information collected artificially. Having patterns means attack strategies can also be found. The true strength of the Two Thousand lies elsewhere. Information without findable patterns. Collisions between living information."

The students began to stir. Having understood the Two Thousand's system, they were guessing the meaning contained in Olivia's words.

"Person-to-person combat, called the flower of the Two Thousand."

The advanced class integrated lessons were divided into Image Zone and Two Thousand classes. The students, who had quickly adapted to Olivia's policies, no longer felt any resistance toward the Two Thousand.

"Over there! Catch it!"

"No, we need to drive it this way!"

The Class Seven children were hunting a Taikon.

It was a reddish-brown strange bird without fur, with an elongated beak and sharp talons. Since it wasn't very large and the synchronization rate was only 10 percent, it was a monster they could hunt without fear.

When dozens of children cast magic into the sky, an anti-air fire net spread out. The Taikon caught in the concentrated barrage was pummeled by all kinds of magic and crashed to the ground.

"We got it! It was hit by Ice Sword!"

"No, you idiot! It was hit by my Wind Cutter!"

"Either way, we won! We caught a monster!"

The standard method for hunting flying monsters was to spread a fire net across their path. The Class Seven students were learning firsthand how efficient anti-air fire nets were in actual combat.

Shirone felt the students' transformation.

Since the Two Thousand classes began, all students had devoted themselves even more to magic training. It was the effect of the practical approach that Olivia advocated.

When the underclassmen's practice ended and it became Class Four's turn, the level of monsters rose dramatically.

The Orc they had encountered in the slash-and-burn village was basic, and even Giant Scorpion and Harpy, which used sonic magic, were running wild.

The Troll with regeneration abilities was the most troublesome. They had heard it had weaknesses to magic, but mediocre attacks didn't even register.

"Come forth, Merses."

Boyle summoned a Merses that inhabited the Arctic Ocean.

A creature from the monster kingdom's echinoderm phylum and sea urchin class, it was a sphere 50 centimeters in diameter with hard cilia growing like spines.

Though it had no intelligence, once it attached itself to a target, it had the habit of cooling the target to make the environment similar to where it had lived, so summoners chose this monster when they needed ice-type abilities.

Since it was a creature that couldn't survive even a minute at room temperature, the Merses that attached to the Troll's back instinctively expelled cold air.

As the Troll began to freeze, its regeneration ability weakened and its movements became sluggish. The students seized the opportunity and concentrated their attacks to shatter the Troll.

"We did it! We defeated a Troll!"

"Boyle, that's amazing! To master Merses, you need to live in sub-zero environments for at least two months, right? When did you go to the Arctic?"

"Haha! Arctic, my foot. I lived in a freezer every day."

With the introduction of the Two Thousand, Boyle's reputation had risen. While there weren't many opportunities to prove the effectiveness of summoning magic in traditional classes, in actual combat, summoned creatures with extreme abilities that peer mages couldn't handle were shining.

On the other hand, Pandora, who had been second in Class Four, gradually became anxious.

Though her desire to stand out was great, overwhelming monsters with fragrance magic was impossible.
