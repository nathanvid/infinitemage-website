'What's going on here? Is scent magic completely useless in real combat?'

Pandora shook her head.

Though scent mages weren't numerous, once they earned their certification, they received favorable treatment in magical society. This was because scents were invisible to the eye, affected everyone within their range, and produced unique effects.

However, to students who didn't understand the true value of scent magic, it could only feel like something barely noticeable.

Pandora looked around at her competitors.

Boyle was conducting standard training like the model student he was, while Shirone's group was hunting freely like the troublemakers they were.

What was peculiar was Dante's group.

Even though the 2000th room had opened, they just sat outside watching other students hunt.

"Hmph, what's this? Are they on a different level? How arrogant."

Dante casually accepted Pandora's stare, then gestured with his chin toward Closer and Sabina sitting behind him.

"Hey guys, that girl is staring at us?"

"Heh, looks like she's getting nervous. I like her style, but her skills are completely hopeless. Don't they teach you how to fight using scents?"

"Obviously they just told her to learn her major in the graduating class. Anyway, it's annoying. That country bumpkin is glaring at us with those eyes. Should I go crush her?"

Closer looked back at Dante and said.

"Would it be okay, Dante? If we showed them a little demonstration?"

"Go ahead. Teach them what the 2000th room is really about."

Only then did Closer and Sabina put on their bracelets. The virtual landscape was a vast grassland. As they entered, students who had already secured spots stopped their training and turned to look.

They had heard stories through magazines, but this was the first time seeing Dante's group's abilities with their own eyes.

Sabina arrogantly lifted her chin and spoke.

"You guys, that's not how you use the 2000th room. If you want to practice real combat, you need to be at least this level. Teacher Thad, please set up package 17."

Thad had been sitting in a corner just killing time when he yawned and transmitted information to the core.

Package 17 could be considered quite chaotic. But with the low synchronization rate, there shouldn't be any particular danger.

Thunder rumbled as dozens of monsters appeared across land, sea, and air.

Golems rose from the ground while ulks and skeletons came running down the hills. Carrion birds called rakshasas, which only fed on corpses, attempted ramming attacks with their spear-like long beaks thrust forward.

The students held their breath at the war-like scene. It was an overwhelming numerical assault that made strategic thinking impossible.

"Huhu, this is how it should be to have any fun."

Sabina leaned back and cast magic. Cold wind swirled around her body, and she soon disappeared from people's sight.

Thad, who had been watching with half-closed eyes, sharpened his gaze.

'Huh? That's Haste?'

A specialized Air-type magic that used wind power to accelerate movement.

The ulks chasing Sabina swung their claws, but she had already circled behind them and was unleashing Wind Cutters.

Meanwhile, the golems, as if unaware that Sabina had even moved, approached Closer who was visible to them.

"Heh, let me show you why we're stars."

A golem's fist struck down on Closer's head. Though made of earth, it weighed nearly a ton—not a force that a physically weak mage could withstand. But the judgment was blocked.

'Earth Rise? That's also a major course skill?'

Magic that drew up the power of earth to increase durability. It had the disadvantage of preventing the caster from moving, but its powerful defensive capabilities that no other school could imitate were its pride.

'I see. So they're the kingdom's stars. The secret was passive skills?'

If active magic focused on phenomena, passive magic focused on the concepts inherent in attributes.

Wind is fast, and earth is solid. The magic derived from these concepts were Haste and Earth Rise.

Since their effects continued even after casting, they could be used simultaneously with other active magic—that was their advantage.

Teleportation was a representative passive skill for mages.

Though it appeared to be an active skill, it actually only converted the mage into a photonized state.

How to move in that light-transformed state was entirely a matter of sensation, which was why Shirone had also rolled around on the ground for a month when learning teleportation.

"Hohoho! Too slow! Too slow!"

"Hehehe! This side is too weak!"

The process repeated: Sabina would inflict fatal wounds, then Closer would crush them with earth's power.

The monster count visibly decreased in an instant.

Having mastered magic taught in the graduating class, clearing advanced class packages was quickly possible.

Thad grabbed his forehead and shook his head.

"What's the point of learning passive skills? Is this the Royal Magic School's method?"

Siena approached and said.

"It probably reflects the capital's academic culture that emphasizes individuality."

"Individuality is fine, but what about diversity? You need to experience various magic to know your aptitude and talent. Passive skills can be practiced sufficiently with teleportation—what's the rush?"

"It is efficient, actually. Active skills have the weakness of not being able to cast two spells simultaneously. Setting aside Iruki with his Double Spirit Zone, of course. Look at Sabina launching Wind Cutters while Haste is active. She's producing results far superior to other students. Canis and Arin, who learned from Arcane, also handle passive skills."

"But Siena, at our school..."

"Don't misunderstand. I'm not in favor of Bashka's methods. I just want to understand why students nationwide are so enthusiastic about them."

Siena adjusted her glasses and pointed to a corner of the 2000th room.

"Anyway... there are students producing the same results with active skills."

Thad looked back at Shirone's group. They were facing package 7, composed of golem units.

Lightning Bolt, Atomic Bomb, and Photon Cannon were landing, and while there were some bumbling moments due to active skills' nature, their teamwork was admirable.

Most importantly, they weren't taking it too seriously.

Watching them laugh hysterically while gasping for breath made one reconsider whether the words "combat realism" and "school" truly belonged together.

"Ugh, I'm tired. Let's stop now."

No sooner had Nade finished speaking than the half-destroyed golem corpses began absorbing soil and rising again.

Ethella, who had opened package 7 and left her post, still hadn't returned.

Of course, Ethella was an excellent teacher. But she was definitely technologically challenged.

What was the point of leaving the reset function on and abandoning her post?

"Let's remove the bracelets. That's the only way. Ethella is too much."

"Wait a moment. Something I want to try just occurred to me."

At Shirone's words, Nade and Iruki stepped aside. Even so, they were curious how Shirone would handle this. To digest an entire package alone, it seemed like the only options were burning with laser or rapid-firing Photon Cannons.

But their expectations were wrong.

When Shirone raised a sphere of light, golden chains poured out like a stream of water.

It was the Shining Chain he had mastered in heaven.

Students' attention focused on Shirone at the appearance of this unheard-of magic.

Even Dante couldn't help but take interest this time.

Shirone bound the lead golem with Shining Chain. With tension that had crushed even Tabu, he could easily destroy an earth golem in one blow, but that method wouldn't let him deal with all of them.

The chained golem rose into the air, then swung like a whip at tremendous speed, slamming other golems into the ground.

Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!

No matter how large their bodies, their essence was still earth. When pounded by the same weight, the golems couldn't even exert their strength before being crushed into the ground.

Students watched the scene in a daze.

"What kind of magic is that? How could someone learn magic like that?"

"It's probably possible because of Immortal Function. Really incredible."

Closer and Sabina, having had the spotlight stolen by Shirone's group, ground their teeth.

They had performed all sorts of tricks to clear package 17, only to find everyone's attention completely elsewhere.

Even Dante was watching Shirone.

Honestly speaking, as a fellow light mage, it was shocking. The photon attribute was difficult to combine, but forming shapes was absolutely impossible.

'So he has at least one trick?'

As the 2000th room became chaotic, Ethella came running in a fluster.

Nade crossed his arms and rolled his eyes.

"Teacher..."

"Oh my, sorry. Did you wait long? Should I set up another package?"

Ethella fumbled with the master bracelet.

Shirone felt drained by the sight, but knowing that even the respected teacher had things she couldn't do made it impossible to hate her.

"Just turn it off, please."

Just hearing the sound of golems rising made him want to vomit.

Shirone's group, exhausted to the limit, drooped their shoulders and left the 2000th room.

Dante was waiting at the exit.

"Fractal?"

After thinking briefly, Shirone nodded.

"Right. Complex forms are impossible with photon sculpting."

"I see. That's a decent method. Impressive."

"Haha, thanks."

"But it's wrong. Your method has a serious flaw."

Nade's face scrunched up.

Shirone had overcome countless obstacles so far. There was no way abilities that had evolved through repeated real combat could have flaws.

"I acknowledge the Unlocker's omnipotence, but the problem is having no other options. You haven't mastered passive skills yet, so the balance doesn't work."

Iruki countered.

"He has offensive magic, defensive magic, sustained damage magic, and binding magic. What balance are you talking about?"

"Looking at tendencies alone, you could think that. But they're all expensive magic. I don't know how much combat experience you've had, but you can't fight for even an hour with that setup. Am I wrong?"

Shirone blinked at the unexpected words. Indeed, there had been no battles lasting over an hour.

Iruki wasn't unaware of this fact, but thought it was just a difference in tendencies.

The reason carnivores can't run as long as herbivores isn't because they're weak. If you can produce powerful effects in a short time, endurance is just a secondary issue.

"So what? Offense is much more advantageous than defense. It's not 5 or 10 minutes—it's an hour. Most magical battles end within that time."

"Of course you could think that way... Well, it's too late to change now anyway. I was just stating my opinion. For reference, the longest bloody battle I've fought lasted 10 hours and 27 minutes."

For Shirone, who was closer to a sprinter, these were shocking words.

A 10 hour 27 minute bloody battle. That was definitely an unknown territory he had never experienced.

"So don't be in such a hurry. The world of magic doesn't only have sprint races."

Leaving behind these meaningful words, Dante walked away.

@

Image Zone class was leisurely.

Just a month ago, it had been a practical arena for gauging advanced class levels, but hitting targets was much more boring compared to hunting monsters.

Class Four students also weren't as motivated to raise their scores as before.

Unable to bear it, Ethella gathered the students and scolded them.

"Everyone, you can't improve without practicing the four-way type. Only by faithfully honing the basics will you become better at hunting too."

"Isn't that fine? They've probably adapted to the Royal Magic School's advanced education."

"Dante, you're now officially a student of Alpheas Magic School too. Please refrain from statements that promote regional sentiment."

Though Ethella made an unusually harsh statement, the effect wasn't significant.

Students still looked bored and waited for the 2000th room classes to return.

But Shirone was different. The field that had been firing him up lately wasn't the 2000th room, but lifting.

This was because he had realized that the secret to shortening Ataraxia's time might be hidden in lifting.
