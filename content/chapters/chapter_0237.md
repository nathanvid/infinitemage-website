To construct a halo, one must expand the Immortal Function to infinity.

However, now that he had obtained the concept of a perfect circle, there was ample room to simplify the mechanism from the second attempt onward.

Lifting targets react sensitively to mental changes. Therefore, if the mind maintains absolute stability, the target will not move.

This meant he could draw a perfect circle without entering the realm of infinity.

From that point on, Shirone focused on creating a state where the target wouldn't move instead of normal lifting training.

After a month passed, results gradually began to show.

The sight of a target at maximum repulsion floating quietly in the Spirit Zone was always fascinating to behold.

This was only possible for Shirone, who had realized the sensation of a perfect circle through the Immortal Function.

The students continuously exclaimed in amazement, but they couldn't understand why he was doing such training.

Closer said, "He's been doing only that for a month now. And he can't even last 10 seconds at it."

Not to be outdone, Sabina added her comment: "He's not a monk—is there really a need to go that far? What help could it possibly be for magic?"

The target floating above Shirone wasn't moving even slightly. This meant no mental changes were occurring whatsoever.

It was a mental state no normal human could maintain—practically no different from brain death. Only Shirone, who had reached the Diamond Body state, could achieve this.

But even Shirone couldn't last more than 10 seconds. Eventually, the target would shake violently and fly out of the Spirit Zone.

Dante spoke for the first time: "It seems... a bit bigger."

"Huh? What's bigger?"

"The Spirit Zone. It looks bigger than before."

Closer and Sabina examined Shirone again. Even to the naked eye, it was definitely larger than before.

"No way. If you could expand your Spirit Zone that easily, there wouldn't be anyone in the world who isn't a Great Magician. Usually you need to undergo hardships or gain enlightenment to... Huh? Enlightenment?"

Sabina realized something from her own words. While magicians also undergo awakenings, the Spirit Zone, being a pure mental construct, was more closely related to the mind of spiritual cultivation.

This was why Ethella, a bishop of the Karcis Order, was also renowned throughout the kingdom as a Zoner.

Sabina's guess was accurate.

Having reached the Diamond Body state, Shirone was in a condition where the limits on mental expansion had disappeared. In this state, continuously rotating the perfect circle was strengthening his Spirit Zone at an incredible rate.

Even as Closer and Sabina poured out disparaging remarks as if they couldn't accept it, Dante silently continued watching Shirone.

The time for the 2000th class had arrived.

Three teachers—Ethella, Siena, and Thad—oversaw the class, and the students now accepted this as natural.

Siena stepped forward as the representative to conduct the lesson.

"Starting today, we'll learn interpersonal combat. The context is different from tactical training, so please follow the controls carefully."

Interpersonal combat had quite a few differences from tactical training.

First, because powerful magical exchanges take place, the gauge depletes much faster. In other words, the intensity of Anti-Magic becomes stronger.

Most importantly, there was the problem that passive skills could result in collision judgments even between people.

A representative accident case was when two magicians casting Teleportation collided at the midpoint.

When that happened, no matter how virtual the reality, it inevitably led to serious injuries.

"The reason three teachers are observing is also due to the dangers of interpersonal combat. Since today is the first day, we'll start with practical training. If there are any volunteers..."

"I'll do it."

Boyle, who had been waiting only for this day with determination, raised his hand.

"Good. Then for Boyle's opponent..."

"Teacher, may I designate my opponent as well?"

She was about to refuse since personal feelings shouldn't be involved, but Boyle was already glaring at his intended challenger.

Dante pointed at himself in bewilderment. "Me? You want to fight me right now?"

"That's right. You've been acting so superior all this time, so you won't back down, will you? If you're as great as you claim, prove it with your skills."

If challenged to a fight, it wasn't impossible, but the position of national first place wasn't something you accepted challenges from just anyone.

"You want to defeat me that badly? No matter what happens?"

"Don't get the wrong idea. The first place in the advanced class is clearly me, and you're the one challenging. So why don't you step up? I'll reform that rotten personality of yours."

"Hahaha! Nice words! Then how about this? The loser kneels before the winner and admits defeat."

Ethella interjected, "Dante, this is strictly part of the curriculum..."

"It's fine. Please let us do it, Teacher Ethella. This is actually what I was hoping for."

Boyle requested with earnest eyes. The memory of getting beaten by Closer was a lifelong humiliation. He was almost grateful that an opportunity to redeem himself had arisen.

Once the match was arranged, Shirone was curious about how Dante would handle Boyle. The photon field had no attack magic. Of course, someone of Dante's level would have learned magic from other fields, but he had definitely called himself the Shining Boy, a magician of light.

While Shirone was lost in thought, Boyle and Dante positioned themselves about 50 meters apart in the 2000th training ground, waiting for the duel to begin.

The initial distance in interpersonal combat plays an important role.

Once battle begins, all sorts of variables come into play, but the start always occurs with both sides facing each other, so the key was to deploy sequence magic for a preemptive strike.

Of course, summoners had different tendencies from other magicians, so they had more freedom in initial tactical deployment.

The standard approach was to abandon preemptive strikes and summon creatures as quickly as possible to defend against the opponent's attacks.

Knowing this fact, Dante declared as if making a proclamation: "Go ahead and bring out your summon first for a relaxed start. I'm not the type to make a fuss from the very beginning either."

Boyle couldn't believe Dante's words.

But it didn't seem like he would lie before even fighting just to leave room for excuses later.

In any case, it was advantageous for a summoner who had no choice but to be defensive in the early stages.

"If that's what you want to do, go ahead. I'll do things my own style."

It was an answer that avoided being swayed by psychological warfare while still binding the opponent to their words.

Dante didn't lose his composure but scratched his eyebrow in perplexity. He had thought this was a hothouse flower, but the guy actually knew how to use his head.

'Summoning magic, huh. That's definitely tricky.'

Summoners can call forth summons through a unique and difficult omniscience called Sangsa.

The first target a magician learning summoning magic summons is themselves.

This is called a doppelganger, and if successful up to this point, the doppelganger gains the possibility of transforming into a third entity.

Summoning something means knowing everything about that something perfectly.

That was Sangsa, and it went through three stages.

The first was called the imprinting stage—using all five senses to observe the target to be summoned and then engraving its image in one's mind.

Since they must remember the summon's appearance perfectly, summoners' observational abilities transcend the realm of ordinary people by far.

A representative training method was called the arrangement technique.

It was training where you mixed up 30 rods that differed by 1 millimeter in length randomly, then arranged them in order of length within one minute.

The second was called the empathy stage—studying the behavior of the target to be summoned and gaining confidence in complete understanding.

Some achieve this through vast knowledge, but most magicians prefer to live together and feel the characteristics.

No matter what creature it is, living together in an isolated place for over a year inevitably imprints that creature's characteristics.

The lower the creature's intellectual ability, the simpler its reactions become and the easier it is to clear.

The third was the annihilation stage, the most important process.

Killing the imprinted target to erase its substance.

If that target still appears in reality despite this, the summoner can manifest it through the doppelganger.

It's not absolutely necessary to kill. The key is creating a state where you can "absolutely never see it again."

The stronger this state becomes, the more vivid the summon becomes.

Killing a target you've formed an empathetic bond with over many years is a terrible feeling, but keeping it alive is also dangerous.

For example, a female magician tried to make a healing magic-casting monster called Opoi her summon but hesitated at the annihilation stage.

She ultimately cleared the annihilation stage by selling the Opoi to a monster collector, but five years later, upon hearing news that it was still alive through some channel, she lost her ability to summon Opoi.

Summons are classified from 10th tier to 1st tier according to Sangsa level, and according to Magic Association research, while there are 13,872 types of lowest-grade 10th tier summons, only 3 types of summons are registered in the 1st tier.

It's a famous fact that one of the 1st tier summons is a lich, an undead monster-class Great Magician.

It's the summon controlled by a Middle Eastern Great Magician named Zulu, and when this fact spread, the academic world was turned upside down.

To clear the annihilation stage, you must erase the existence, but a lich was a monster that had lost the ability to die.

Some say that Zulu herself became a lich and merely summoned a doppelganger, but unless she opens her mouth, no one will ever know the exact truth.

Boyle arrogantly stretched his neck while saying, "I was second place in the advanced class last semester. By a narrow margin. You know why I deliberately didn't enter the graduating class and stayed here? Because I thought I was lacking."

"Yeah. Seems like it."

"But not anymore. I've worked hard for four whole years. And during this vacation, I finally succeeded. My summon will tear you apart."

"I'm looking forward to it. Honestly, Mercedes was a bit disappointing."

The corner of Boyle's mouth split in a grin. In this moment, he was neither a son in his mother's embrace nor a model student who valued principles—he was one summoner.

"Don't worry. This time will be different."

When Siena called for combat to begin, Boyle and Dante simultaneously entered their Spirit Zones.

As sequence magic deployed, their minds strengthened and their Spirit Zones changed to their respective Four-Direction Styles.

Boyle was defensive type, and Dante was target type.

"Come forth, Gaos."

Where Boyle extended his hand, another Boyle was born. Following the mystery of trinity where a magician's doppelganger transitions to a summon's doppelganger, it transformed into Gaos, a 6th tier summon.

Kraaaaaaang!

A humanoid monster reaching 3 meters in length assumed a quadrupedal stance. Its smooth, hairless skin was blue, and its muscles were cracked like rock.

While its body resembled a human, it had no eyes as if wearing a blindfold, and from its nose bridge to where its jaw should be was entirely mouth.

Inside sparse fangs, straw-like tongues writhed in a tangle, and along the spine extending from its neck, tentacles that discharged electricity protruded.

It had four fingers, and claws with hardness rivaling diamond extended 10 centimeters.

"G-Gaos. He really summoned Gaos."

The students were stunned. They had heard he trained during vacation, but they never dreamed it would be Gaos.

Gaos was among the highest grade of summons registered in the 6th tier—a monster whose physical abilities alone could rival even 5th tier creatures.

The teachers were equally surprised.

While there were no summoners in the current graduating class, very few people had achieved 6th tier and graduated from the school throughout its history.

"My goodness. When did he learn such summoning magic? There are time limits for using vacation time."

At Ethella's words, Thad smiled bitterly.

"He must have calculated this long ago. That kid raised it with complete determination."

The shrewdness of today's children was tongue-wagging impressive.

Whether advanced class or graduating class, they were all magicians vulnerable to physical force. If he summoned Gaos, whose physical abilities were considered around 5th tier level, he could pass the graduation exam much more easily.
