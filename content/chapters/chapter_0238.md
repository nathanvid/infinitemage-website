Even after the battle began, Dante remained motionless. Honestly, he hadn't even anticipated that a 6th-tier summon would appear.

"How about it? Why don't you surrender now before you get humiliated? Then I'll cancel the whole kneeling thing."

"Impressive. How did you manage Gaos?"

When Dante made a disgusted expression, Boyle's shoulders rose smugly.

"If it were me, I would have been too disgusted to even go near it. You lived with that monster for years, didn't you? Don't tell me you crossed the forbidden line? Kekeke."

Boyle's eyes bulged.

Given the occupational nature of summoning mages, living with beasts for extended periods was natural. In fact, some eccentric mages even crossed the forbidden line to complete the empathy stage.

This was a well-known fact among mages, but bringing it up was clearly mockery.

"I'll definitely make you kneel before me."

Gaos's charging speed was so fast it was difficult to follow with the eye. Even Shirone, who had fought Ulk in Slash-and-burn Village, didn't want to face Gaos.

'I wonder what Dante plans to do?'

Contrary to expectations, Dante simply avoided the position using teleportation, which could be called orthodox.

But that alone couldn't stop Gaos.

The monster twisted its body sharply, approached right up to Dante's nose, and swung its claws.

Everyone thought it was over.

But at that moment, Gaos's movements slowed down.

"What?"

Gaos, whose mind was connected to Boyle's, examined the ground. A small magic circle was already glittering there.

Shirone could identify the type of magic circle just by seeing its effect.

"A slow magic circle?"

Dante placed his gloved hand on his head and mocked.

"Still far from it? You said 6th-tier, but you're pretty slow."

The enraged Gaos tensed its muscles, but it couldn't twist the flow of time with brute force.

Kraaaang!

Finally breaking free from the magic circle, Gaos roared and charged at Dante.

But this time too, it got caught in another slow magic circle that had been laid out in advance, falling into a miserable state once again.

Dante, who had been watching with disdain, yawned and pointed downward.

"Look at the ground, the ground. Are you stupid?"

"You bastard! How dare you mock me!"

When Boyle shouted, electricity generated from the hose connected to Gaos's spine. Lightning that escaped the magic circle's domain devastated the area where Dante stood.

Having been hit by magic cast by a 6th-tier summon, it could be considered over.

But the spot was already empty.

Boyle belatedly realized the reason.

"An illusion magic circle?"

In the spot scorched by lightning, only a small magic circle was drawn alone. It was a trick that had been set up from when the first slow magic circle was cast.

'Where the hell did he go?'

While Boyle looked around, Dante put his arm around his shoulder from behind. Boyle, shocked to the point his heart nearly dropped, couldn't move a finger.

Dante's face suddenly appeared over Boyle's shoulder.

"Are you kidding around right now? Since I accepted your challenge after a while, do it properly."

"Kuk! G-Gaos!"

As Gaos returned with fierce momentum, Dante once again moved away using teleportation.

Based on the battle so far, Shirone realized Dante's specialty.

"I see. Light magic, specifically magic circle combat using information magic."

It was information-based magic derived from photon output, which Shirone had learned before the Speed Gun test.

Since photons had the fastest information transmission speed, they were compatible with magic circles.

Wasn't the angelic ability Halo also essentially light?

Moreover, the magic circles Dante used were one-time instant magic circles.

Although the maintenance time was only about a minute, the time needed to construct magic circles was also shortâ€”within a second.

Currently, dozens of magic circles were floating around Dante.

Gaos, who had been charging in all directions, stopped moving for the first time upon seeing the changed scenery around him.

Closer, who had been watching the battle, raised the corner of his mouth.

"Reflection magic circles. He's trapped. Boyle can't escape."

Boyle looked around with a serious expression. Wherever his eyes turned, magic circles were glittering.

There were 48 magic circles in total, and examining them with a summoning mage's superhuman senses revealed they were identical in size and form, with a diameter of 57.62 centimeters.

Dante approached with both hands raised like a conductor.

"Welcome to Dante's playground."

"Shut up!"

Dante shot Air Strike at a reflection magic circle. The moment Gaos approached right up to Dante's nose, Air Strike, which had bounced off no less than 7 magic circles like cushions, struck Gaos's flank hard.

The fact that Dante didn't even think of dodging meant he had perfect control over time and space.

Dante scattered magic everywhere as if conducting.

Air Strike traveled around the magic circles in three-dimensional trajectories, multiplied to two at duplication magic circles, and attacked Gaos.

Kraaaaa!

No matter how high Gaos's physical abilities were, taking consecutive hits from Air Strikes enhanced by magic circles was overwhelming.

Boyle was stunned. No matter where he moved Gaos, Air Strike kept hitting directly. When three consecutive hits landed, the summoning nearly got canceled.

"What's going on? The great Gaos falling to attacks of this level?"

The reason for enduring Dante's mockery was that the magic circles' maintenance time was running out.

If he held out just a little longer, an opportunity would come. If he didn't miss that one chance, there was still a possibility of victory.

"Now!"

When the magic circles disappeared, Gaos charged at maximum speed.

Though slow magic circles were laid at each section, Boyle wasn't one to fall for the same trick twice.

As if mocking Boyle's thoughts, Dante placed two slow magic circles askew on Gaos's shoulder and knee.

When different time flows were applied to each part, the balance collapsed and Gaos's body tumbled over.

"You really are stupid. Magic circles are magic too. If you dodge them, I can just place them directly on your body."

Boyle gritted his teeth. What kind of guy was this bastard to handle a 6th-tier summon like a child?

Gaos looked like it was struggling even to get up.

Even though it was a virtual summon, its characteristics were identical to the real thing, so regardless of the mage's mind, if stamina dropped, it couldn't fight.

"Are you okay? Your darling looks like it's hurting."

"You son of a bitch!"

Having been humiliated in front of everyone, Boyle desperately made Gaos stand up.

Blue lightning erupted from its entire body, transforming into an electric form.

This was a self-destruction attack that even the real Gaos wouldn't use unless it was a life-or-death situation.

Kraaaang!

"Already giving up? How boring."

Dante pointed his finger at Gaos. Ten magic circles were laid on the ground in a row, then all stood up after a moment.

It was Rising Target, a technique of information magic.

'Those are amplification magic circles...'

Boyle calculated the distance. If Air Strike passed through all the magic circles lined up in a row, he could expect it to produce nearly 10 times the power.

But with Gaos's speed, it was possible to get in after passing at least 4 magic circles. In that case, Dante's amplification count would relatively decrease to 6 times, making it a situation worth betting on.

'I have the advantage in power. I'll go with a strong attack.'

The moment Gaos reached the first magic circle, Dante cast Air Strike.

But Air Strike was shot toward somewhere completely different, not at Gaos.

The Air Strike that flew somewhere forward bounced off a triangular cushion and entered from the farthest point of Rising Target in reverse.

'He calculated the distance in reverse?'

Since Gaos and the magic were charging in the same direction, Air Strike could reach its destination after passing through all 10 magic circles.

Boyle didn't give up hope. Even so, Gaos was fast. The key was to strike Dante before getting hit by Air Strike.

"I won!"

When Gaos reached the last magic circle, Boyle shouted without realizing it.

But as if to crush his hope, Gaos's movement suddenly slowed dramatically.

By the time he realized the last magic circle was slow, it was already an irreversible situation.

Though summoning mages had superhuman observation skills, in a situation where 10 magic circles were overlapping, it was impossible to confirm what the last magic circle was.

When Air Strike, which had passed through 9 magic circles, struck his back hard, Gaos bounced off diagonally and vanished.

Boyle could only stand there in dejection.

If he squeezed desperately, he might be able to summon again. But he didn't want to.

Dante had a genius-level understanding of time and space. The tactic of using information magic to create favorable situations and gradually cornering opponents made him lose even the will to fight.

Dante shrugged his shoulders.

"Don't tell me that's the end? I went this easy on you and you still disappoint me."

"Don't be cocky. It was close. If Gaos had just a little more stamina left, you would have been the one to fall!"

"Yeah, I guess you have to comfort yourself that way. But you know what? I could have ended it anytime I wanted."

"Nonsense! You also put forth your full effort...!"

A magic circle glowed beneath Boyle's feet and his body sank downward.

He immediately emerged through the bottom of a magic circle floating in the sky and fell in front of Dante.

"Ahhhhh!"

Boyle, crashed into the ground, couldn't endure the pain and arched his back like a bow.

Dante clicked his tongue and shook his head.

"Didn't you know passive magic gets pushed around? Magic circles are passive skills too."

"Kugh! You... when did you put a magic circle under me..."

"Well, when was it? Try guessing."

Boyle reviewed the battle. But Dante had been busy avoiding Gaos and had never approached him.

No, there was exactly one time.

"Don't tell me... the reason you put your arm around my shoulder was..."

"Correct. I can activate magic circles with a time delay. This is called Time Work. Since summoning mages handle two egos, they usually stay in place, right? Plus, the technique of flipping magic circles upside down is called Spin, and it's quite difficult. Anyway, even while you were distracted by your darling, I was always ready to take you out. Got it, mama's boy?"

"You, you bastard...!"

"But I'm tired of it now. Let's end this."

As soon as Dante finished speaking, another magic circle appeared and Boyle sank downward with a whoosh.

"Ahhhhhhh!"

Boyle, moving through a total of 7 spatial teleportation magic circles in complex patterns, couldn't collect himself.

The reason he couldn't even resist was that the actual distance was zero.

It was no different from just standing there.

Dante calculated the timing and fired Air Strike. The magic that bounced exactly six times struck Boyle's back as he fell upside down.

When the hit registered, lights came on in both bracelets.

The scenery of the 2000th floor disappeared from Boyle's view, and a floor covered with physical blocks spread out.

The students seemed shocked, keeping their mouths shut.

Boyle didn't know what had surprised them. He had just been bounced around frantically and taken an unexpected blow from a blind spot.

On the other hand, what the students had witnessed was a kind of feat.

Boyle and Air Strike had crossed paths here and there in mid-air before colliding at exactly one point, and that decided the match.

It wasn't a technique that could be replicated just because it could be calculated.

Dante looked around at the students who were quiet as mice, then asked Siena.

"Teacher, could you turn on the percentage gauge?"

Since revealing full power was usually avoided, but Dante was confident.

Siena used the master bracelet to display the percentage gauge.

Not even 1/50th of his mental power had been depleted.

Shirone realized this was a message Dante was sending. The reason mental power consumption was low despite creating numerous magic circles was because they were basic magic.

Photon output was magic anyone could do easily, and constructing simple information with it wasn't difficult either.

It was more efficient to install 5 magic circles that amplified magic power by 2 times rather than one magic circle that amplified it by 10 times.

But the effect created when magic circles interlocked was enough to handle 6th-tier Gaos like a pet.

A tactic of never giving up the initiative throughout the battle, gradually pressuring the opponent, and eventually drowning them.

That was exactly Shining Boy Dante's combat method.
