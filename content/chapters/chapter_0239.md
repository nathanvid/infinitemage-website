"Ugh! This is impossible. How could this..."

Boyle was shocked by the fact that he hadn't managed to reduce Dante's mental strength by even 1 percent.

He hadn't been fighting a Great Magician. This was just a same-age classmate, and he himself was a genius who had distinguished himself with summoning magic.

In the end, it came down to the difference in details.

Dante had taken ownership of thousands of minor variables that occurred during combat, creating an extreme gap.

"How about you stop being pathetic and hurry up? You promised, didn't you?"

Dante waited arrogantly with his hands in his pockets.

It was a situation where Boyle, the official first place of the advanced class, had to publicly kneel in submission.

Boyle felt anger rising as much as the weight of being first place. But a promise was a promise, and no way of escape came to mind.

"I... lost."

The moment Boyle knelt and acknowledged his defeat, a heavy rain poured into the students' hearts.

Shirone's group, who had been supporting Boyle, felt equally heavy-hearted.

But it was an undeniable defeat.

Iruki said, "We have no choice but to acknowledge it. Information magic, huh? That would really be troublesome to deal with."

Sabina interjected, "No, it's only possible because it's Dante. We've been fighting under Teacher Olivia since we were ten years old. The number of real combat experiences is different from yours. Dante's official record is 472 battles, 472 victories. Moreover, he's never lost even in unofficial matches - he's an undefeated legend. He's not someone a mere countryside school's first place can challenge."

472 official battles alone. Adding unofficial ones, it meant he had fought over roughly a thousand battles.

Any mage would develop adaptability after engaging in that many interpersonal combats.

But what made Dante remarkable was that he had never experienced a single defeat in that process.

When Dante's background was revealed, the students buzzed with excitement. The transformation from an annoying classmate to the kingdom's star happened in an instant.

No matter how terrible one's personality, fame follows when skill transcends everything. Or perhaps that's exactly why people become even more enthusiastic.

All the students flocked to Dante. Though they didn't show it outwardly, their efforts to strike up even a single conversation were visible.

In the space left empty as students receded like a tide, only Canis and Arin remained sitting alone.

Though it was their first time seeing a thousand interpersonal battles, it didn't particularly impress them, having fought to the point of exhaustion themselves.

"Interesting. So magic schools train like that too. Canis, want to try it too?"

"Not really. I'm not in the mood."

"It's not that you're scared of losing to Dante, is it? Hehe."

Though she said that, Arin's feelings weren't different from Canis's. A thousand times didn't appeal to her either.

"What's so special about that? Even Shirone is staying quiet, so there's no reason for me to get worked up."

"Shirone is staying quiet because he naturally dislikes fighting. That's different from you, Canis."

"Arin, lately it seems like you're subtly taking Shirone's side?"

Arin stuck out her tongue playfully.

Of course, anyone who was Canis's enemy was also her enemy. If the two clashed, she would help Canis with all her strength, but even so, Shirone was someone she couldn't bring herself to hate.

"Anyway, what do you think? Information magic seems to be a new trend. Could you win?"

Canis snorted.

He didn't like the thousand times, but Dante's skill was definitely real. The interesting point was that he was a genius symmetrical to Shirone.

Iruki was also a genius, but he seemed too biased toward one side.

"Hmm, if we properly fought on a battlefield..."

"If you fought?"

Canis's face, which had been silent for a while, gradually became serious.

Arin, who had detected his wavering emotions through her supernatural senses, poked his ribs and urged him on.

"Hm? If you fought? What would happen?"

Canis turned his head as if avoiding Arin's gaze and spoke in a crawling voice.

"It would be a... magnificent match."

**Match Point (1)**

"Yes! I won. Hey, hurry up and kneel."

"Damn it! Let's go again! If I hadn't made that mistake!"

At some point, a catchphrase had emerged in the advanced class. It was the phrase Dante had spread about kneeling in submission.

Similar scenes even frequently occurred in Class Seven. Though it was just for fun, the atmosphere of obsession with competition was no joke.

If A and B fight, who would win? Could the victor among them defeat C?

Everything was transforming into the royal magic school system that ranked all students school-wide.

"Tch! I don't like it. Anyway, a strange principal came and ruined the school."

Mark, lying sprawled on the grass, grumbled while watching underclassmen engage in interpersonal combat at the practical training ground.

His current match point was first place in Class Six's hierarchy. This was because he had thoroughly crushed everyone who challenged him. If it were his younger self, he would have walked around with his shoulders squared with pride, but after coming to respect Shirone, the hierarchy of lower classes held no meaning.

Maria, sitting beside him and plucking grass, said, "Mark, he's still the principal, so what do you mean by 'strange principal'? What will you do if you get caught saying that?"

"What can I do about being annoyed! I don't like that Dante guy or whatever either. Especially Closer - that bastard used a passive skill when fighting me. If we had gone fist to fist, he wouldn't have been a match at all."

Maria vividly remembered the scene of Mark getting beaten up. Closer in particular was younger yet had even harassed her.

"Shirone will take care of it somehow. After all, they're in the same Class Four. If they bully us too severely, I'm thinking of talking to Teacher Thad too. What do you think?"

Mark felt his pride hurt even at the thought of asking for opinions. He wanted to get revenge on the guy who had bullied Maria, but their skills were real. Of course, he too, as a self-proclaimed member of the Shirone line, had many monster-like seniors. Shirone, Amy, Iruki...

It was because they were holding the line that he could ignore Dante's group when he saw them, but on the other hand, the situation where he couldn't resolve things directly was maddening.

"I don't like it... Really..."

Since liking fights has nothing to do with age, Class Four students were equally interested in combat rankings.

However, since Dante had sorted out Class Four's hierarchy, their gaze was directed to even higher places.

"If Teacher Ethella and Teacher Siena fought, who would win?"

"Obviously Teacher Ethella. She's someone recognized even in the kingdom."

"Fighting isn't about reputation though. They say Teacher Ethella achieved Triple, but Teacher Siena is an authority on freezing magic. In real combat, someone who specialized in one thing is the best."

"By that logic, it would be Teacher Thad. If they're the same 6th grade, flame magic is more advantageous than freezing magic."

Shirone stepped in when he couldn't help but hear the conversation even when trying to block his ears.

"How can you say such things? They're all excellent teachers. Such people wouldn't fight each other over who's stronger."

The students looked disinterested. After Boyle knelt in submission, the center of gravity in the advanced class had shifted from Shirone to Dante.

Initially, students had thought Shirone would step forward to restore the school's damaged honor. But that never happened, and he even showed signs of avoiding confrontation. Recently, rumors even circulated that he was using tricks because he didn't want to fight Dante.

"We're just talking about fighting in a safe place, so what's wrong with discussing it? Honestly, you're the same way. You don't even participate in interpersonal combat because you're scared of fighting Dante."

"I'm not scared. I just don't want to fight meaninglessly. If it were tactical training, that would be different, but interpersonal combat isn't even related to grades."

"Tch, grades, grades. In the end, you're only good within the school too. A real mage should be strong in actual combat."

Thinking that further words wouldn't get through, Shirone shrugged his shoulders.

The classmates who had held some expectation turned away with disappointed expressions when even provocation didn't work.

"Tch, Shirone's nothing special either."

"What can you do? In front of the kingdom's star, Shirone is just a countryside star."

Shirone couldn't understand what meaning there was in ranking students among themselves. The strength he pursued was in a different realm from overpowering others through fighting.

On the other hand, there were inevitably students for whom that was the only meaning. A representative example was Pandora, second place in the advanced class hierarchy.

After Dante had subdued Boyle, she had actively followed Dante's group around and was now practically their lackey.

"Hey, Pandora! Hurry up! I'm dying of thirst!"

At Sabina's sharp voice, Pandora hurriedly ran over with a water cup.

"Sorry. The line was too long."

"You should have just said it was for me to drink and cut in line. Really, no flexibility."

"Hehe, is it hard? Should I massage your shoulders?"

"Would you? My shoulders are stiff from running too much with Haste."

Pandora sincerely massaged Sabina's shoulders. It would be a lie to say her pride wasn't hurt, but she thought they would recognize her true worth soon enough.

Becoming close with Dante's group meant instantly entering the kingdom's top promising group. A rise in status from second place in a provincial school to fourth place in the entire kingdom. Wasn't it a gamble worth trying?

Closer said while cooling himself with a hand fan, "Hey, Pandora. I'm a bit thirsty too."

"Oh? Got it! I'll go get water."

Pandora immediately ran to the portable water station. The sun was particularly hot today, so many students were lined up.

It would be easy to cut in line using Dante's influence, but such behavior would definitely be undignified. Her specialty was getting annoyed so that the person in front would choke while drinking water.

"Hey, are you elephants or what? Drink moderately and move aside! You should think about the people behind you."

"Here, drink my water."

Boyle offered his water cup. Sabina looked displeased, but thinking of Closer waiting, she couldn't refuse.

"Hmph, thanks."

When Sabina was about to return to Closer, Boyle called out, "Wait a minute. You're not planning to give that to that guy, are you?"

"What business is it of yours? Don't tell me you're holding a grudge against them because you lost to Dante in a match?"

"I acknowledge my defeat. But why are you acting like this lately? There's nothing wrong with becoming friends with Dante, but you don't need to act so servile."

"So what business is it of yours, I said. Why, are you already anxious? Worried about me overtaking you?"

"It's not that! You've been my rival since childhood! It bothers me that you're bowing down and going along like this!"

"But not anymore. I'm going to join the Dante line. I'll be published in academic journals soon, and when I graduate, there'll be chaos with people trying to scout me. If you're envious, just say you're envious. You've already lost, so saying such things has no persuasive power at all."

Boyle shut his mouth. There were many things he wanted to say, but none of them would reach Pandora's ears. It was the inevitable fate of a loser.

"Damn it! Do whatever you want!"

Shirone's group, watching from afar, understood Boyle's feelings.

All the friendships in the advanced class were revolving around Dante. No one challenged the absolute number one, and the more that happened, the more Shirone wanted to escape the current situation.

He thought that success would come naturally if he continued pursuing his own path without having to fight.

What currently filled his mind was how he could master Ataraxia even a little faster. With that on his mind, interpersonal combat couldn't possibly catch his attention.

He devoted himself to lifting training every single day without rest, and finally managed to hold the target for as long as 20 seconds.

At this point, this too was a feat. Maintaining a mental state that others couldn't endure for even one second for a full 20 seconds.

"Wow, Shirone is really something. Your Spirit Zone is getting bigger too. No matter what anyone says, it's amazing talent."

"That's only because he's an Unlocker though. He can't even make eye contact with Dante."

"Honestly, Dante is too strong. I understand Shirone's position too."

"Why are you conclusively saying that Shirone ran away? Shirone is also terrifying once he enters competition. Besides, there's still Canis and Iruki left."

"Hmph! If you're so confident, why is he avoiding it? If I had that kind of skill, I'd challenge him right away out of spite. He's acting pathetic by running away, so even the girls are going to Dante."
