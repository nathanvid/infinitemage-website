"You think Shirone is like you, fighting to gain popularity?"

"What? Are you done talking?"

Whenever students gathered, they would weigh Shirone's group against Dante's group. Most placed Dante as number one, with countless speculations swirling beneath him. These were the events that had transpired in the two months since Olivia had taken office as the new principal.

Nade was bothered by the noise coming from all directions. It seemed like before the two thousand system was introduced, they hadn't divided into sides so blatantly. In any case, since academic performance was improving, the faculty wouldn't withdraw Olivia's policies.

"Ugh, seriously! Should we just transfer to another school?"

Nade muttered words he didn't mean. The girls glanced their way, whispering among themselves before sneering and running over to Dante.

"Forget it. Don't worry about it. We just need to do things our own way."

Shirone spoke calmly and returned to his lifting training.

Nade clicked his tongue. While Dante, who ruled like an emperor despite being just a student, wasn't normal either, Shirone's nerves were pretty thick too—not batting an eye even when rumors of being a coward spread.

A week later, there were midterm evaluations.

Dante's group occupied first through third place, pushing down the rankings of all Class Four students. Of course, the hierarchy remained the same.

After the midterm evaluations, students stopped talking about Shirone. Without any feedback, spreading gossip became meaningless.

Pandora made constant efforts to blend in with Dante's group, but an invisible barrier still existed between them.

Thinking this couldn't continue, Pandora pretended to massage Sabina's shoulders while carefully bringing up the topic.

"Um, Sabina. I want to do well in actual combat too. What should I do?"

"Actual combat? Well, you do use magic by the book. Don't do that—learn passive skills instead. It'll be much easier. It's not like learning them first will hurt you. Anyway, this school is strange."

While she gave advice, it was clear she didn't want to make any further effort.

Pandora's body heated up as she spoke more directly.

"How about teaching me in the two thousand system instead?"

"Oh? Are you challenging me right now?"

"No, no! Absolutely not! I just thought it would be good to know some passive skills or tactics I could use in actual combat."

Closer's gaze turned to Pandora's chest. He had been looking for an opportunity, and if she was coming to them like this, it would make things easier.

"Yeah, Pandora is part of our group anyway, so it wouldn't hurt for her to get stronger. Should we give you some special tutoring?"

Pandora was overjoyed. Most of all, she was happy that they considered her part of their group.

"Really? I'd be so grateful if you would!"

Their friends couldn't not know Closer's true intentions.

Dante wanted power, Closer wanted women, and Sabina wanted popularity.

They had been childhood friends who helped each other get what they wanted since they were young, so this time Dante followed Closer's lead.

"Alright. Let's stretch our bodies for once. Let's go into the two thousand system."

Dante's group set up in a corner of the practice hall, positioning Pandora and offering advice one by one.

As advice from others always is, it was nothing more than packaging commonly known facts in plausible language.

Closer casually put his arm around Pandora's shoulders as he spoke.

"Now, the three of us will surround and attack you, so try to handle it with scent magic. We'll go slowly, so don't worry."

"Huh? Oh. Got it."

Dante's group pressured Pandora with basic magic.

From the receiving end, it was a fairly beneficial lesson, but to their classmates watching, it looked like they were training a mongrel.

Excited, Sabina shouted, "Hoho! Not bad! Don't just run away—try counterattacking. We're getting bored."

Following her words, Pandora cast the scent of olive flowers that caused mental confusion. It wasn't immediate, but because opponents easily let their guard down, it was often used in actual combat.

And Sabina fell right into that strategy. Thinking she could catch her, Pandora spread her signature scent, Fire Flower (manufactured by Alones).

With her senses dulled by the olive scent, Sabina had no choice but to inhale a small amount even though she knew better.

Heat spread through her lungs as if she had inhaled fire. If her sync rate hadn't been fifty percent, it would have been dangerous.

"Cough! Cough!"

"Sabina! Are you okay?"

Pandora, who had been running over in concern, felt a chill and stopped. Sabina, who had been looking down, raised her head with cold eyes.

"S-sorry."

"It's fine. You did very well. This is how you improve."

As if nothing had happened, Sabina's face changed to a fake smile. She couldn't show that she had been beaten in front of other students, especially underclassmen.

Terrified, Pandora stammered, "Um... I think we can stop now. This has been very helpful."

"What are you talking about? You've already grown this much. Now, let's begin the real training!"

Before she could finish speaking, Dante and Closer rushed in. Angered that Pandora had presumptuously landed a hit, they no longer held back.

"Here, Pandora! Take this too!"

"Hohoho! Here's another one!"

When all three attacked in earnest, Pandora had no way to block them. Eventually, Anti-Magic close to a critical hit shook her Spirit Zone, and she collapsed to the ground.

Dante's group didn't stop. They carefully controlled their power so that her gauge would decrease as slowly as possible while mercilessly pouring magic on her.

Their classmates watching the scene spoke worriedly.

"Hey, isn't that going too far, even so?"

"That's not teaching. It's just beating her up."

Pandora seemed resigned as she hung her head, accepting the magic pouring down on her. She felt so miserable that even the words to ask them to stop wouldn't come out.

Boyle clenched his fists at seeing his rival being humiliated. Though she had a rough personality, Pandora was also a child who had worked hard from Class Ten to reach this position. He couldn't understand what she had done wrong to deserve such humiliation.

As Pandora's mental strength hit bottom, her bracelet lit up. Since they could no longer cast magic on her, Sabina stopped attacking and looked down at her with a sneer.

"How was it? Did it help?"

When Pandora raised her head, her eyes were full of sadness. Even without anyone telling her, she knew what had been done to her.

But she forced herself to smile. If even Dante's group abandoned her, she would have nowhere else to go.

"Yeah. I learned a lot. Thank you."

"Puhahahaha!"

Closer clutched his stomach and burst into laughter. He had known she was naive from the start, but he hadn't expected her to be this innocent.

Sabina still wasn't satisfied. She had to at least repay the humiliation of being hit by Fire Flower.

"You have to get beaten like this many times to become strong. Understand?"

"Yeah. I think I was too weak. Please help me next time too."

"Really? Then hurry up and kneel."

Pandora looked up desperately. But only coldness could be felt in Sabina's eyes.

"What are you doing? You lost, so kneel and beg. Did you already forget the rules?"

Pandora tried to endure it, but she couldn't stop the tears from bursting out. Her shoulders trembled, and tears poured down.

"Kekekeke! Are you crying now? Don't tell me you were frustrated? Acting all high and mighty when you're weak. Hey everyone, look here. Your senior is bawling!"

The underclassmen turned their heads in embarrassment. Just imagining themselves in that situation was horrifying.

The teachers also realized the seriousness of the situation. Thad especially intended not to let this slide as he walked toward them. He would need to hear their side, but they wouldn't be able to avoid disciplinary action.

Spotting Thad, Sabina realized she had crossed the line. She had gotten too excited after being hit by that country bumpkin.

But she couldn't show herself trembling. For a student who was doing well in Bashka, one or two disciplinary actions were like badges of honor.

In any case, it wouldn't be good for the situation to continue, so Sabina tried to resolve it as quickly as possible.

"Why? Can't bring yourself to kneel? Then just get lost. Let's never make eye contact again."

"No, no."

Pandora shook her head. It was an action that came out before she could even think. If they would understand her heart even a little, what did it matter if she knelt now?

"I lost. So..."

The moment Pandora bent her knees, someone grabbed her arm. Thad's steps stopped and Boyle's eyes widened.

"Shirone? Why..."

Turning her head, Pandora was puzzled that the person who had come for her was Shirone. He had never once interfered in Dante's affairs before.

Shirone passed by Pandora and approached Dante. The silence lasted longer than expected, but no one felt it was long. It was their first collision, and it had taken three months to reach this point.

"Why are you doing this?"

Dante snorted. The first words from Shirone's mouth turned out to be some clichéd hero act.

"Doing what? What did we do? Did we do anything other than practice person-to-person combat?"

"Three of you attacked Pandora. And someone who had lost the will to fight."

Sabina covered her mouth and laughed. It seemed like she could avoid disciplinary action by using this situation.

"Oh my! Did you like Pandora? This is totally amazing! This worked out well. Take this chance to confess..."

"I wasn't asking you. I'm talking to Dante, so get lost."

Sabina's face reddened at Shirone's dismissal, but Dante didn't care. He judged it better to handle this matter carefully.

"Fine. I'll admit we went too far. But Pandora asked us to teach her first, and we just agreed. That's the whole situation, so ask Pandora for the details. See you later."

As Dante turned away, Pandora hung her head glumly.

Though she resented them for dumping all the blame on her and running away, it was true that she had been the one to bow her head first.

"Don't talk nonsense. Do you even have the skill to teach anyone?"

Dante's steps came to an abrupt halt.

He knew it was provocation, but this one definitely had impact. If the language had been chosen deliberately, it was an excellent combination.

"What... did you just say?"

"Don't be mistaken. Just because you fought and beat a few classmates doesn't mean you're the best. Person-to-person combat is something you can't know without fighting everyone."

"Haha! How absurd. That's why there are rankings and records. I've never lost once, and I even finished off the advanced class first place here. Isn't that enough?"

"Are you that confident? Then how about fighting me once?"

Students turned around with shocked faces. It was the first time Shirone, who had remained motionless like a stone, had thrown down a challenge.

Dante's complexion wasn't entirely calm either. If things continued this way, wouldn't Shirone become the champion of justice and he the villain to be defeated? A champion needed a proper stage set for a champion.

"Why should I?"

Dante had no intention of playing along with Shirone's ideas.

"Think about it. You're the one who's been avoiding fights all this time. But now you want to fight me? I'm not someone who can fight when I want to fight and run away when I want to run away."

"I don't want to force a fight with someone who doesn't want to fight. Instead, promise you won't bully my friends again."

This was what annoyed Dante. Shirone treated lightly the power he considered most important in the world, the throne that countless people coveted.

"Who did I bully? They all bow and scrape on their own. If you didn't like it so much, why didn't you stop me from the beginning? It's troublesome to throw a tantrum after missing your chance."

In any case, Dante, who had received special orders from Olivia, also had Shirone as a target. After pondering briefly, he came up with a plan that could both preserve his pride and crush Shirone.
