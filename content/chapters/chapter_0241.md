"Fine. I'll give you one last chance to challenge me. Defeat Sabina and Closer and work your way up. Since I defeated Boyle myself, you can't complain, right? If you can beat those two, then I'll face you myself."

Closer and Sabina cheered. This set the stage perfectly for Dante. Of course, they had absolutely no intention of losing to Shirone.

"No. That's not necessary."

Shirone rejected Dante's proposal.

"Hey, get your head straight. You're in the challenger's position. If you want to face me, at minimum you need to..."

"Just have all three of you attack me at once. I want to finish this quickly and stop wasting time on this nonsense."

"This crazy bastard...!"

Dante's group's eyes widened in shock. Even at the Royal Magic School, they had never received such an insult.

Nade, who was watching the situation unfold, clicked his tongue.

"Man, his trash talk is deadly. I'm never getting into a war of words with Shirone."

"He's got a knack for pissing people off. It's just that he usually doesn't bother," Iruki said as he voluntarily walked into the hostile scene. He had been holding back until now only because Shirone hadn't stepped forward, but he didn't have the twisted hobby of enjoying being ignored.

"Hey, Shirone. If it's something this fun, count me in too."

Dante glared fiercely at Iruki, who had butted in like an unwelcome guest. He was clearly trying to turn this into a group battle because Shirone alone wouldn't be able to handle it.

"Iruki, this isn't your place to interfere. Your scheme is transparent."

"What are you talking about? This kind of thing is my specialty. I'll take you all on at once too. If I calculate one second per person, it'll take exactly one second total."

Closer snorted with laughter.

"Idiot, if it's one second per person, that should be three seconds..."

Then he realized the true meaning of the words and frowned.

"These guys are really...! Are you insane? Who do you think we are to be acting so arrogant!"

"If you're confident, try attacking one at a time. The conclusion is simple - whoever wins the fight, that's it. Why make things so complicated with all this talk about defeating this person or that? Isn't that right, Dante?"

"You seem to be misunderstanding something. I'm not telling you to defeat them to wear Shirone down. I'm saying if you want to challenge me, prove your qualifications."

"We're qualified enough. If we defeat Shirone, there won't be anyone left to challenge you anyway."

Iruki pointed to the students observing the situation.

"Get it? There's no need to overthink this. If you defeat us, you're the best. You'll have taken control of the advanced class. And that's probably the special mission you received from someone."

It was a direct hit. Having been at the Royal Magic School, Iruki would know Olivia's strategy.

Even if he didn't know the details, he would at least sense that she was involved in their aggressive behavior.

Now that their cards were on the table, Dante didn't bother hiding anything.

"Fine. Let's make it a team battle. Since we can't disrupt classes, we'll have an unofficial match on the weekend. We'll face off one person each week, and whoever gets two wins first ends it. If you lose twice first, I won't even need to fight Shirone - it'll be my victory. Do you accept?"

"Fine. If you want to keep up appearances to the end, go ahead. I'm going to win anyway, so you won't get a chance to avoid facing Shirone."

"Hah, you talk big. Then add one more person to your side. Anyone is fine. Call Boyle if you want."

"That wouldn't be fun. We have our own line, you know."

Iruki turned his head. Nade pointed to himself with a bewildered expression.

Helping Shirone was one thing, but he never expected to be dragged into the battle. Still, if he refused now, it would break Shirone's momentum, so he couldn't not go.

As Nade walked over, Dante tilted his head.

"Nade? Are you okay with that?"

From what he had observed, Nade's grades weren't particularly good, and he hadn't shown any standout advantages during practical evaluations.

But Iruki had used the word "line." Since Dante had received a special mission to crush Shirone, a situation where he could trample everyone connected to him was actually better.

Arriving at the battlefield, Nade whispered to Iruki.

"Hey, what are you thinking? What if I lose?"

"Just fill the numbers. I'll handle everything myself."

While the two were whispering, Dante went to the teachers. Since they had heard the entire conversation from start to finish, no separate explanation was needed.

"We want to settle this. We request that the Advanced Practice Hall be opened on the weekend."

Siena spoke as the representative.

"It's not something we can decide alone, but we'll consider it for now. Go back and wait."

The students stopped practicing and waited anxiously. Shirone throwing down the gauntlet was an unprecedented event, but if the school didn't approve, the match would fall through.

When all the teachers in charge of the advanced class gathered, Siena spoke.

"So it's come to this. Should I say this was bound to happen eventually?"

Thad shook his head.

"I'm against it. We shouldn't let students judge other students' wrongdoings. I'll convene a disciplinary committee and publicly announce the fact that Pandora was harmed."

Ethella, who had been deep in thought with her chin in her hand, spoke up.

"Hmm, I agree with Teacher Thad to some extent. But calling it 'judgment' seems too extreme. Couldn't we interpret this as self-regulation among students?"

"I'm not unaware of the importance of self-governance. But this is a duel. Something seems wrong about students fighting each other with magic to determine a winner."

"Even so, Boyle and Dante already had their match. Many students are dueling right now too. Opening the Advanced Practice Hall on weekends is no different from the concept of supplementary classes."

Siena thought Thad's opinion was correct. But she also understood Ethella's desire to entrust this to Shirone. She knew that Thad's words wouldn't get through to the school anyway.

"Since opinions are divided, we'll have to bring up practical issues. If we refuse, Dante will appeal to Principal Olivia. What decision do you think she'll make?"

A groan escaped from Thad's throat. Olivia would definitely approve. He didn't know why, but it seemed like she had entered the school targeting this from the beginning. Moreover, Alpheas had told them to follow her orders unconditionally. What was his master thinking when he brought Olivia to the school?

"We are the teachers. In this situation, are you saying we should trust Shirone? Why exactly?"

"Because Principal Olivia trusts Dante. And Principal Alpheas trusts Shirone. Looking back now, this doesn't seem to be just a problem between students."

Ethella said.

"I want to trust him too. Just as I am both a teacher and a monk, Shirone may be a student, but he has the spirit of a monk who pursues good. Knowing this fact, maybe Principal Alpheas entrusted full authority to Principal Olivia."

Thad fell into thought. Now that he thought about it, it was definitely strange. No matter how great his master was, there was no way he could have recruited Jerome Olivia, the kingdom's top teacher.

There must be quite a story behind it.

'How do you cause more trouble than your student, Master?'

Thad sighed and walked to the students. Then he announced the preliminary results regarding Dante's request.

"After an emergency meeting, we will approve the opening of the Advanced Practice Hall and unofficial personal combat training."

The students erupted in cheers that seemed to lift the roof. Thanks to this, Thad's words about needing approval from higher up were drowned out.

Though it was probably unnecessary to mention anyway.

"Incredible! This is a major event!"

"Finally they're going at it! Shirone and Dante! Dante and Shirone! Woaaaah!"

The students couldn't contain their excitement and jumped around wildly.

In the midst of all the shouting and cheering, Iruki tapped people on the shoulder one by one, pointing to himself.

"Hey, it's not just Shirone fighting - I'm fighting too."

"Woaaaah! Iruki! Did you hear? Shirone and Dante are going to fight!"

"......"

News of the duel spread throughout the entire school through word of mouth.

Underground clubs were already distributing flyers with information about the two fighters to encourage betting.

The teachers' meeting room was also bustling. All the faculty had gathered to discuss how to handle this incident.

"I'll say it again - this is dangerous. Resolving students' personal emotions through physical conflict goes against our policies."

Olivia didn't even snort at Thad's words.

"They're not fighting - they're determining who's the best. All of them will enter the graduating class next year or the year after anyway. Consider it an intensification of competition."

"But Principal! If these kinds of incidents continue, the school's reputation will...!"

Olivia raised her hand as if to say 'enough.'

"The duel between Shirone and Dante will be an event that captures the attention of the entire kingdom. I will also personally appeal to the teachers' council to dispatch a correspondent."

The meeting room fell silent. She, as an inspector from the teachers' council, was personally calling in a correspondent. This would put Alpheas Magic School in the public spotlight. Moreover, if they featured the kingdom's star Dante and got published in academic journals, it would be an unprecedented benefit for the school.

Sweet fantasies drifted hazily through the teachers' minds. The kingdom's premier prestigious Alpheas Magic School. The top teacher (namely, me) guiding students there.

On the other hand, Thad felt bad. He always supported raising the school's reputation, but he didn't like using it as a tool to silence teachers.

"Principal Olivia, let me say something."

"Thad, proceed as planned."

"Yes, proceed as planned... Huh?"

Thad's face reddened as he turned his head.

Alpheas was standing by the back door. Since this was such an important matter, even Olivia hadn't issued an order to exclude visitors this time.

"As expected, Mr. Alpheas has foresight. This incident will be a tremendous benefit to the school - it would be foolish to ignore it."

"How could there be any question? Thanks to this, I'll become famous in my old age too. Hahaha!"

"After the duel ends, there will be major articles about Dante's victory. That child Shirone will be quite hurt, but you seem to be enjoying yourself alone, which makes me feel sorry for him."

"Heh heh! Both children attend Alpheas Magic School, so they're practically my students. But I also believe the best must be determined."

Olivia's eyes narrowed. It annoyed her to death that he countered every single word without backing down.

This time, Alpheas's eyes were equally fierce. Two teachers who had devoted their lives to education had found students to mark the end of their careers - it was a collision of decades of educational philosophy.

An hour later, the proposal for an unofficial duel was formally approved through proper procedures.

**Magical Clash (1)**

Students eagerly awaited the coming weekend.

It was the first time in nearly ten years that Alpheas Magic School had generated such a topic of conversation.

Rumors spread that the teachers' council would even dispatch correspondents on the day of Shirone and Dante's duel.

Male students joked about pulling extraordinary pranks to make themselves known to the world, while female students worried about what to wear.

Iruki and Nade headed to their research society. Even during the short walk, they heard countless stories - real or fake - but none of them mentioned their own involvement.

"I didn't expect much from the start, but now that it's come to this, it's deflating. Are we just side characters?"

"At least the recorder is coming. Hey... I think it would be better if I went first."

Nade had been worried ever since the match was approved.

Since Closer was targeting Iruki, his opponent would probably be Victor Sabina.

That terrifying woman who accelerated with Haste while scattering Wind Cutters in all directions.

Excluding the graduating class, she was skilled enough to rank in the national top 20, so regardless of matchups, it would definitely be a tough fight.
