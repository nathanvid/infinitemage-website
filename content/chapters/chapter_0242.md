"What are you so worried about? I went out of my way to include you, and all you do is whine."

"What else can I do! If I lose, how frustrated will Shirone be! Why did you pick me in the first place? You know as well as I do that I'm...!"

"It's better to lose than to run away."

Nade's steps came to an abrupt halt.

Iruki turned around and said, "We only need to secure one victory between you and me anyway. Can't you see the atmosphere right now? We're playing the role of horses carrying Shirone to Dante's doorstep. That's important work. It's absolutely not something we can entrust to someone who isn't part of our group."

"Iruki..."

Nade's face was filled with emotion.

"And honestly... I don't think you'll lose either. There are a few variables, but you still have a chance to win, which is why I chose you. Don't feel pressured and just give it your all."

Iruki was right. Whether they won or lost the match, if Shirone had made up his mind to fight, bringing him to the enemy was not something they could leave to others.

They didn't want to carry the memory of running away in the distant future, and to stand proud as Shirone's friends, it was time to take a gamble.

"Alright! Let's give it a shot! What the hell!"

The weekend for the first match had arrived.

The showdown between Nade and Sabina wasn't generating much buzz, but students had already arrived at the Advanced Practice Hall.

As the first match that would determine whether the showdown between Shirone and Dante would come to fruition, its importance was by no means low, and since the team dynamics were clear, there were many points of interest for spectators.

When Amy arrived at the Advanced Practice Hall, it was so packed with people that there were no empty seats.

"Amy! Over here!"

Seriel waved from the front row of the temporarily installed spectator stands. Since Amy had come thinking she was fairly early herself, she was amazed by Seriel's enthusiasm in arriving even earlier. She could also see Mark and Maria sitting next to her.

"Good day, senior!"

Mark greeted her with a booming voice, and Maria bowed her head politely. Amy accepted their greetings casually and sat down next to Seriel.

"How long have you been here? You must be really free."

"Hehe! Actually, I gave Mark special orders. I haven't been here that long either. Still, I couldn't watch this kind of event from far away. Especially since it's an important match for Shirone."

"Important, my foot. He really does cause a lot of trouble, knowingly or unknowingly."

Amy spoke nonchalantly, but her inner feelings weren't entirely calm. Dante from Eastin was a name even she, who had been recognized as a genius, had heard enough times to get calluses on her ears.

The boy who had defeated all the renowned aspiring mages across the nation to truly claim the Kingdom's number one ranking. The barrier Shirone was trying to overcome this time was on a completely different level from those he had crossed before.

Though Shirone's abilities had improved dramatically since Heaven, the common opinion among experts was that the information magic Dante wielded was so sophisticated that even professionals couldn't easily replicate it.

"It's starting! It's starting, senior!"

At Mark's voice, Amy looked toward the Advanced Practice Hall.

Nade and Sabina had entered the practice area, and Shirone was watching from the sidelines with Iruki.

The referee duty was to be rotated among the Advanced Practice Hall's dedicated teachers, and today it was Teacher Thad.

Thad called Nade and Sabina to the center and explained the match rules. The gist was that the referee could stop the match at their discretion if serious physical collisions occurred.

Nade and Sabina engaged in a staring contest like deaf people, not even turning their heads.

Though Nade had been groaning and worrying just ten minutes ago, he now wore a calm expression, having apparently finished his mental preparation.

Closer pointed at Nade and said, "That guy might be a dark horse. Even when he dodged my punch on the first day, I got the feeling he was someone experienced in fighting."

"No, it's more than that..."

Dante shook his head as if denying Closer's words, but couldn't quite form the rest of his sentence.

To simply call him experienced in fighting, there was a strong feeling that something was off. If he had to pick a similar type, he'd say Canis, but that wasn't quite right either.

"Either way, this match will reveal it. No matter what kind of opponent he is, Sabina will win."

Having finished his explanation, Thad instructed Nade and Sabina to return to their designated positions.

The starting positions had been decided through mutual agreement - 30 meters each, for a total of 60 meters.

It was a distance where Spirit Zones couldn't reach each other, but first strikes could be made through sequence magic.

"Now we'll begin the match between Nade and Sabina."

As Thad raised his arm to give the starting signal, the murmuring voices of the students died down all at once.

Graduating class students who had experienced Advanced Practice Hall combat said this moment was the most tense.

Advance and retreat, attack and defense - the way Spirit Zones were operated in the early stages determined the flow of the battle.

The four forms of the Four-Direction Style were basic, and various irregular forms created diverse variables, making this the foundational moment of the duel.

"Begin!"

Nade and Sabina had the same thought.

Advance, attack, first strike.

The sequence magic duel was evenly matched. As their Spirit Zones overlapped, Electric Bolt and Wind Cutter crossed paths.

In terms of speed, there weren't many elements that could match electricity except for photons. However, electric force, which was sensitive to charges, had the disadvantage of poor accuracy.

Ultimately, the Wind Cutter was first to slash past Nade's arm. The moment his Spirit Zone wavered from that gap, Sabina cast Haste on herself.

Not many students could follow Sabina's zigzagging sprint with their eyes. The sight of a human-sized object moving like a cat was like watching a magic show with tricks.

Having secured Nade's rear, Sabina swung her hand blade, and a blade wind sliced past Nade's neck.

'Hit confirmation? Is it over?'

The moment Sabina thought this, a weak electric current flowed through her arm. It was Nade's specialty, Image Copy magic. When she turned her gaze, dozens of Nades had already taken control of the surroundings.

"Hmph! Not bad with the tricks!"

Checking each one would waste time and risk falling into a trap. Sabina immediately raised her concentration and deployed the advanced technique Cutting Flower. As she brought both hands above her head and spun, Wind Cutters spread out in all directions.

One of Nade's illusions hurriedly threw his body. Nade, who had escaped outside the radius of Cutting Flower, looked at Sabina with a dismayed expression.

She had fired over forty long-range Wind Cutters per second. It was definitely a level that transcended the advanced class.

Air magic was divided into the Press series that compressed air and the Blow series that wielded air. In his opinion, Sabina seemed to be a mage specializing in the Blow series.

'As expected, basic mode won't work?'

As Nade concentrated his mind, blue clouds began to rise around him. Electromagnetic bolts popped out from the clouds, moving around in linear motions.

"Plasma?"

Sabina hastily stopped her approach. Even she couldn't act recklessly in front of plasma.

"Wow, so that's plasma. That guy wasn't just lucky last time."

"Are you stupid? It's not something you can learn through luck."

Real plasma occurs at ultra-high temperatures, but in magic that implements the phenomenon, it falls under the realm of omniscience, so the temperature itself doesn't increase. Nevertheless, it was one of the most powerful weapons for electric mages.

Plasma could be seen as electricity spread like clouds, filling the surroundings. In other words, just as fish rule in water, electric mages ruled within electric clouds.

The disadvantage of poor accuracy in Bolt magic was impossible within plasma's domain, and the bolt's trajectory could even be changed at will. Since the environment itself was electric, the mental energy consumption for magic was reduced, and most importantly, it was a passive skill.

An ability like a blessing for electric mages.

However, understanding the omniscience of plasma, which only occurs in extreme environments, wasn't something even professionals could easily do.

For the first time since the battle began, Sabina felt tense. Combat manual advice was to refrain from approaching if an electric mage had deployed plasma, unless there was a significant skill difference.

"In that case..."

Sabina changed tactics. The only way to attack Nade without penetrating the plasma domain was to generate tornadoes from outside and sweep everything away.

As she cast tornado magic, several 10-meter-high whirlwinds danced around.

Nade tried to close the distance somehow while using Image Copy to confuse her vision.

One Electric Shock would do it. If he could stun her for just one second, no one could withstand the ultra-high-speed electric bombardment cast from within the plasma domain.

But Sabina moved freely around the Advanced Practice Hall with Haste's agile movements, giving no openings.

As the plasma domain expanded, the number of whirlwinds increased as well. Sabina, seemingly determined to settle the match, began combining the 30 tornadoes one by one. The number quickly halved, but their size increased by more than four times.

If the tornadoes completely merged like this, there would be nowhere to hide in the Advanced Practice Hall. Nade judged that if he was going to do something, it had to be now, and investigated the terrain through plasma's electric force.

About 32 percent was metal.

Of course, it was just an environment implemented with Advanced Practice Hall information, but anything conductive could be controlled with plasma.

'I feel a bit sorry since this is another profession's technique, but...'

This wasn't the time to be picky. If he lost, Iruki would bear the burden of making Shirone's match happen alone.

Nade generated a magnetic field with plasma. Roughly metal particles mixed in the rock burst through the ground. As he created a magnetic storm, a metal tornado formed instantly.

Sabina was shocked. Though its size was less than one-tenth of her tornado, if roughly 3 tons of mass rotated at the same speed, the destructive power would be equal.

'No. No one can break my secret weapon!'

Sabina gritted her teeth and combined 15 tornadoes. Rotational fusion was an extremely advanced technique, but she succeeded in combining 30 tornadoes in just 2 minutes.

A whirlwind massive enough to be called a typhoon arose. Nade's metal tornado charged toward the eye of that typhoon.

Everyone knew this would be the final attack.

As students watched without even breathing, the two tornadoes collided at the center of the Advanced Practice Hall.

It was a battle of mass versus size. The steel tornado danced freely inside the giant tornado, slashing through the air currents.

Anti-Magic activated from Sabina's bracelet, and the gauge rapidly decreased.

Nade wasn't in normal condition either. Though he was disrupting Sabina's tornado, the difference in size was too severe.

"Grraaaah!"

Wind pressure stronger than magnetic force was slowly dismantling the dense state of metal, calming its speed. At some point where the rotational speeds were canceling each other out, the two forces meshed precisely.

Sabina's tornado dispersed into turbulent air currents. With a thunderous roar, strong winds spread outside the Advanced Practice Hall. Friends watching from the sidelines were pushed back, unable to withstand the wind pressure.

Students waited for the dust clouds that had taken over the space to clear. As some dust rose upward and some settled down, the two figures were revealed.

Sabina was hunched over, panting for breath, while Nade had completely collapsed to his knees.

Thad checked both their gauges through the master bracelet.

Both had their mental energy drained to the bottom - neither was in a state where one could be called superior.

But the target of the students' admiration wasn't Sabina, but Nade. They hadn't expected that he, who was merely mid-level in the advanced class, could push the nationally renowned Sabina this far.

'I'm not sure about this? Sabina might actually lose...'

Sabina walked over while panting. Her pride was hurt by the fact that she had fought evenly with an unknown student she hadn't even expected.
