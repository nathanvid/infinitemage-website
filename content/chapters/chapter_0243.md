"I won't let this slide!"

Sabina charged forward without even having the energy to cast Haste. After all, her opponent shouldn't be in any condition to cast plasma either.

At that moment, shocking words came from Nade's mouth.

"I lost."

Sabina, who had been rushing to attack Nade's throat, hastily stopped her charge at his sudden surrender declaration.

She would have preferred to finish him off with her own hands, but attacking after a surrender declaration would mean disqualification.

Now that it had come to this, it didn't feel like she had truly won, and something felt unsettling about it all. But she figured it was enough to think that Nade had used up all his strength in that final clash.

"Hmph, you got lucky. Kneel down and formally acknowledge your defeat."

Nade immediately kept his promise. Since he was already kneeling, he only needed to move his mouth.

"Yes. I lost."

Sabina's expression crumpled. The reason she had set up this rule was to enjoy the miserable sight of someone drowning in the feeling of defeat. But she couldn't sense that kind of bitter emotion from Nade.

"Are you really a man? You lost to a woman and you can kneel so meekly?"

"I lost, so I'm saying I lost. And honestly, it's really embarrassing, you know? Can we stop now?"

Nade truly hung his head low like someone who had been defeated and returned to his friends. It would have felt less unpleasant if he had at least laughed as if denying the match results.

Thad watched Nade walking away and clicked his tongue.

'He could have tried a bit longer. Sabina was nearly at her limit too. Still, well done, Nade.'

The match ended faster than expected. Any Class Four student would have at least one magic spell capable of strong destructive power.

In actual combat, there aren't many opportunities to cast such spells, but this match had good compatibility and similar skill levels, so it could be cleanly finished with a clash of power versus power.

When Nade reached his friends, he squeezed his eyes shut and hung his head, overwhelmed by uncontrollable guilt.

"Shirone, Iruki! I'm sorry! I lost! Really, I'm sorry!"

"What kind of talk is that? We're fighting as a team. I can't guarantee I'd definitely win either. It's okay, you did your best."

Iruki added a word.

"You did well for yourself. You've improved compared to before, at least."

Honestly, they hadn't expected Nade to perform to this extent. When he fought Lucas from the Parrot Bandits, he had given up completely, but lately it seemed he had gained at least some measure of control.

"I'll go back to the dormitory first to rest. Is that okay?"

"Yeah. You must be tired, so go in early."

Even Shirone couldn't stop him from that.

And so Nade left the practice hall, mixing into the crowd of students. But the place he headed wasn't the dormitory, but a secluded park. Once he confirmed that no one else was around, his true feelings finally burst out.

"Agh! Damn it! You idiot!"

He had wanted to be a strength to Shirone. But Sabina was truly strong, and if the match had continued from there, the price he would have had to pay would have been beyond imagination.

He still needed the protective fence that was the school.

"Ho ho ho! So you were here? You were pretending to be calm, but you must be dying of embarrassment, right?"

Nade let out an involuntary sigh. When he turned around, Sabina, who had somehow followed him, was standing there.

"Do you still have business with me? The match is over."

"No, I think I have some left. Honestly, I'm displeased. I don't know why, but I get the strong feeling that you're not properly accepting your defeat."

"I even knelt down, so what more do you want me to do?"

"I'm not quite sure about that. Would you like to kneel here once more?"

Nade didn't have the energy to indulge Sabina's unreasonableness. He only felt sorry toward Shirone, and pitied himself for being unable to help his friend.

"Just think whatever you want. Even if you spread rumors that you're stronger than me, I won't say anything, so just leave me alone. I'm going."

The moment Nade turned toward the dormitory, Sabina spoke.

"I looked into it a bit, and the West family is quite famous, isn't it?"

Nade's steps stopped abruptly.

"It's a complete disaster if there ever was one. From what I can see, the family head is an unemployed gambler and the lady of the house is ostracized in social circles, right? They have nothing but go around living luxuriously, so the rumors are widespread..."

A sound like thunder rumbling was heard.

Sabina, whose breathing suddenly became blocked, saw the world spinning dizzily. When she came to her senses, she was embedded in a tree trunk deep in the forest.

Nade, gripping Sabina's throat, thrust his face close to hers.

"Say that again."

"Gack! Gaaack!"

When Sabina took in Nade's face with her gaze, she was paralyzed with fear. It wasn't an expression a human could make. He wasn't a villain or a psychopathic murdererâ€”he was just a monster.

'I'm going to die here...'

It wasn't a hypothesis but a certainty. If she had been caught by a murderer, she might not know, but there's no foolish human in the world who would expect mercy when caught by a beast.

"Do you want to live?"

Sabina desperately nodded her head. As her consciousness gradually blurred, she wet herself without realizing it.

"Should I break your neck bones? Or should I dry up your blood?"

Sabina didn't understand what he was saying. As if the connection between her head and body had been severed, her legs moved on their own.

"Huuung! Huung!"

Nade contorted his face and gathered electric current in his hand. He was planning to evaporate her blood like this.

The moment electric power concentrated in his grip, one person's face came to mind. Her voice gently soothed Nade's beast.

'Nade, once is enough for mistakes, isn't it?'

Nade's eyes were bloodshot as if tears of blood would pour out at any moment. But gradually, humanity returned to his pupils, and he released Sabina's throat and slowly stepped back.

"Gack! Gaaack!"

Sabina collapsed and gasped roughly. She still didn't understand what was happening, but her lungs frantically sucked in oxygen.

"You won, and I lost. That's all that happened today. Got it?"

Sabina nodded. She was prepared to nod her head no matter what instruction came from Nade's mouth.

But Nade seemed satisfied with that and left the forest. Just before exiting the entrance, his steps stopped. He slowly turned his head to look back at the large tree.

'Eek! What do I do? Was I discovered?'

Pandora, hiding behind the tree, felt her heart pounding. She had been trying to get revenge on Sabina but had coincidentally witnessed a scene she shouldn't have seen.

Nade's voice was heard.

"Pandora, I took care of the revenge, so you go back."

Mentioning her name was a warning not to make a big deal out of the situation. Though she couldn't be seen behind the tree, Pandora covered her mouth and nodded.

Nade left the park in a miserable mood. This is how things always ended up. It would be nice if it would rain refreshingly, but the sky was just gloomy like his heart.

"Iruki, I will never become a mage."

@

The weekend for the second match arrived.

With Nade and Sabina's match being a hit, even more people gathered than the previous week. Especially since the third match would be canceled if Iruki lost, many expected it to be a more intense battle than the previous week.

Perhaps because of this, even teachers who had said they weren't interested in kids' fights were awkwardly smiling and peeking around for seats.

While Ethella, who was serving as referee, checked the inspection items, Shirone and Dante's group waited on the sidelines.

Sabina's expression wasn't good. The trauma from the beating she suffered in the forest still hadn't faded. No, rather than that, it was getting worse, and lately she had been suffering from nightmares every night.

As the match time approached, Closer warmed up his body. After relaxing his muscles with high-difficulty stretching uncharacteristic of a mage, he jogged in place and looked back at Dante.

"I'll finish this. There's no need for you to come out too, right?"

In team matches, the rule was that whoever got 2 victories first would win. But Dante knew that such a thing wouldn't happen as long as Olivia was overseeing it.

"Still, the match won't be canceled."

"What? Why?"

"Because our master wants Shirone to be crushed. She's already applied for a correspondent to the teachers' council. The school wouldn't want this kind of event to be canceled either."

"I see. So even if I win, you and Shirone will still fight?"

"But the situation will be different. If we take 2 victories, we can make Shirone even more miserable. That would probably be the best outcome."

"Heh heh heh. Good, I'll set up the perfect stage for you."

When Ethella gave the instruction to come to the center, Iruki and Closer stepped forward. After the rule explanation ended, Closer looked down at Iruki, flaunting his tall height, and spoke.

"When Anti-Magic comes in, you feel a tingling sensation in your nose bridge. But when you fight me, it's not just Anti-Magic. Have you ever had your nose bone broken? By a punch, I mean."

Iruki didn't answer.

"It hurts tremendously. It hurts so much that tears pour out. From now on, I'm going to flatten your nose bone like an orc's. Even if you scream to stop, I'll keep pummeling you. Is that okay?"

The corners of Closer's mouth rose wickedly.

"Why aren't you saying anything? Are you scared? But it can't be helped. The match has started and you're going to get beaten up tremendously. In 10 minutes, you'll be screaming with blood flowing from your nose. A few teeth will probably break too. Your ugly face will become even uglier."

Ethella intervened.

"Please refrain from unnecessary talk before the match. Both of you, go to your designated positions."

Closer, who showed Iruki his large fist, returned to his position while formulating strategy based on information he had studied before the match.

Iruki's specialty was fast targeting with a deviation-type and flame explosions with no travel time. Most importantly, since he was a Servant ability user strong in sequence magic, preemptive strikes had to be considered impossible.

Closer wiggled his fingers at a distance of 60 meters from Iruki and decided on his initial response. Since his own specialty was also in defense rather than attack, there would be no problem if he proceeded according to standard tactics.

"Match start!"

The moment Ethella's signal fell, multiple explosions occurred around Closer. Closer, who covered his face with both arms, had surprise in his eyes. Explosions simultaneous with the start. Deviation-type magic shrinks in size as distance increases. But the fact that it flew 60 meters without moving a single step was truly top-class sequence magic.

Shirone smiled bitterly. He had already felt it during the Speed Gun test, but the power of sequence magic using logarithms was tremendous.

In fact, Iruki's Speed Gun score was the highest in the history of the magic school, excluding Shirone who had opened Immortal Function.

The students were mesmerized by the sight of Closer's massive frame being buried in flames. Even with a 50 percent sync rate, it could be dangerous if hit by continuous attacks.

Finally, as the explosions cleared, Closer's figure was revealed. As the earthen walls that had been protecting his entire body crumbled down, his face appeared, laughing leisurely.

"Heh heh, is that all? It's as ticklish as being bitten by a mosquito."

He had enhanced his body with the passive skill Earth Rise and even cast Earth Skin, creating earthen defensive barriers to protect his body. Ordinary explosions couldn't even deliver a shock.

Closer, who closed the distance with teleportation, drove the match toward close combat, opposite to Iruki.

"Rock and roll!"

When Closer swung his hand as if scooping up dirt, the ground undulated and the surface began rolling up.

A boulder that had grown to 3 meters in diameter crushed and passed over the spot where Iruki had been standing.

Iruki escaped with teleportation. But the moment his feet touched the ground, the surface collapsed as if a trap had been dug.

"Heh heh heh! This is the end!"

Closer, who had sealed Iruki's movements with Earthquake, the symbol of earth magic, connected it with Eruption magic. Due to the frictional heat generated by compressing the earth, an explosion occurred. Nearly 5 tons of earth and sand shot up from the pit Iruki had fallen into.

Iruki flew up covering his face with both arms. In his head, explosive equations were rapidly developing.
