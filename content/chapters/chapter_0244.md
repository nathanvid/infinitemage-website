The downside of explosive magic was that omniscience wasn't intuitive, making casting times vary dramatically depending on the explosive power.

A 1-kilobuster referred to power capable of blowing away an entire wagon, and it took an average of 21 seconds for a certified 10th-grade mage to cast a 1-kilobuster.

But Iruki, a Servant, could complete omniscience in just 3 seconds. And the power he was now building up over more than 10 seconds reached a whopping 10-kilobuster.

Closer sensed that this explosion would be extraordinary from the fact that Iruki's magic maintained silence. Trying to defend everything would likely result in critical injury instead.

Having predicted the impact point, Closer concentrated his Earth Skin on the left side. As if time was accelerating, earth accumulated to form a solid earthen wall.

Simultaneously, Iruki's Atomic Bomb exploded.

Since there was no knockback judgment, Closer didn't move, but his Earth Skin vanished without a trace.

"Phew!"

Closer exhaled roughly. Though he had neutralized the shock, the power that had blown away his Earth Skin was chilling.

At this point, Iruki also became serious. He hadn't expected Closer to perfectly block even a 10-kilobuster explosion. He was a much tougher mage than anticipated.

'I guess I have no choice.'

Iruki split his mind in two and operated another Spirit Zone. The moment two Spirit Zones infiltrated through synesthesia, Closer's eyes widened.

It felt like fighting two mages at once.

'Damn. Isn't this cheating?'

From now on, Closer couldn't enjoy this either. If 10-kilobuster Atomic Bombs came from both sides like the one he'd just blocked, defense would be impossible.

"I'll end it before that happens!"

As he cast Heavy Stone, earth clumped together at tremendous speed in midair, and a rock mass weighing nearly 1 ton fell toward Iruki's head.

Though it was simply transmuting earth (an alchemical term for creating new matter), when executed from high places, it was a gravitational weapon that could crush someone to death with potential energy alone.

Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!

Wherever Iruki moved, rocks crashed down.

Though transmutation took time and calculating arrival time made it less effective in personal combat, if one couldn't move for some reason, it was horrifying just to imagine.

'I see. So he's actually aiming for that?'

Iruki grasped Closer's intention. The time it took to reach the ground meant timed attacks were possible in combination with other magic.

As expected, Closer cast Heavy Stone over a wide area.

While multiple rocks formed in midair, he skillfully detached Heavy Stone's omniscience and equipped new omniscience with practiced ease.

When he cast Slug magic, surrounding pebbles floated up and shot out like bullets.

"How about this!"

Falling rocks from above and pebbles spreading like buckshot from the front came flying.

"Tch! I didn't want to use this."

Iruki switched one Spirit Zone to defensive mode and cast protective magic.

Hundreds of tiny 10-gram-buster bombs spread in a spherical formation along the Spirit Zone's surface. Then the rushing pebbles collided with the bombs, creating small explosions.

Students stared blankly at the sight of countless chain explosions occurring at the boundary between offense and defense.

It was the Bomblet Barrier, symbolic of explosive mages.

A technique that floated hundreds of micro-bombs around oneself to intercept approaching objects before they could reach the mage, with the key being how many small bombs one could manifest in the Spirit Zone.

By that standard, Iruki had reached a level where he could manifest 387 small bombs simultaneously.

Though the number alone showed professional-level skill, even with Bomblet Barrier deployed, Iruki found himself on the defensive.

His separation form being too excellent was also a problem. Most of Iruki's advanced techniques originated from separation form. But Bomblet Barrier achieved maximum effect when executed with a defensive Spirit Zone.

In short, it was like an attack-oriented swordsman who wielded twin swords giving up one blade to take up a shield.

Of course, being Iruki with Double Spirit Zone, he could at least hold one sword, but without operating two separation forms simultaneously, he couldn't break through earth magic's defenses.

"Hahaha! I'll end this!"

Closer covered his face with both arms and charged straight into the Bomblet Barrier. It was something he could do because he trusted his Earth Skin's defensive power.

Breaking through the curtain of micro-bombs, Iruki rapidly detonated Atomic Bombs.

As 10-gram-buster explosions hammered his guard like mad, this time Closer also grimaced. But far from stopping his charge, he went even deeper. And the moment his Earth Skin shattered, he raised his fist and struck Iruki's face.

Iruki's pupils spun around as he was knocked down.

Silence filled the arena. In Advanced Practice Hall personal combat, no one had expected a mage to punch with their fist.

"C-can he do that? He punched him."

"I don't know. Since it's a duel, isn't it okay? There's no rule against using your body."

Students' gazes naturally turned to the judge. Ethella also wore a troubled expression.

When she checked the status with the Master Bracelet, that last blow had been quite effective.

Until now, Iruki's gauge had been decreasing by 1 percent per minute. A constant decrease rate like an hourglass meant he had been managing well.

But the moment he took Closer's punch, it was cut in half. It was the weakness of mages being vulnerable to physical attacks.

Having made her decision, Ethella stepped back in acknowledgment.

Given earth magic's characteristics, physical collision could be sufficiently effective, so it could be considered a legitimate tactic.

"Hahaha, didn't I tell you? I gave you a hint but you couldn't take it, so even being called a genius is just an empty name."

Closer kicked the waist of Iruki who was trying to get up. Iruki's body rolled and sprawled on the ground.

Since it was an attack that had knocked down even the huge Mark in one blow, Double Spirit Zone was already impossible.

Nevertheless, Closer approached while maintaining Earth Skin all over his body, preparing for the unexpected.

"Shall we start the remodeling? First, let's toughen up that body."

Closer lifted his foot and began trampling on him. Iruki couldn't move, curled up with his face covered.

"Hey, does it hurt? Does it? You won't show your face till the end? You were ugly to begin with, so what's the big deal?"

"That bastard...! I'll kill him."

Nade clenched his fists and trembled with rage. The reason he wasn't rushing in was for Iruki's last bit of pride.

"Shirone, you stay back. I'll take responsibility."

"If we're going to fight, we should fight together. But I don't think we need to step in. Iruki hasn't given up yet."

Nade observed Iruki carefully. Through the gap in his covering arms, he could see Iruki's smiling face. With even his Bomblet Barrier defeated, there was nothing left to try. What could he possibly be thinking to smile even while getting beaten up?

"Surprisingly tough. Hey, turn around."

Pushed by Closer's kick, Iruki lay spread-eagled. Contrary to expectations of being terrified, his face looked relieved.

"This bastard keeps being annoying till the end. This time I'll really crush your nose."

Displeased, Closer raised his leg, aiming for Iruki's face. One blow would break his nose.

"Hehehe! Hehehehe!"

Laughing as strangely as his bizarre voice, Iruki arched his back like a bow, supported himself on his head, and looked at Shirone.

"Shirone, sorry. I was saving this to use against you."

Students were speechless. Iruki's bizarre behavior was about to begin again.

"You bastard!"

Thinking he was being mocked, Closer brought his foot down like lightning, but Iruki's lips split into a long grin.

"I'll show you something interesting, Shirone."

Bang! The boot heel struck the ground.

Rolling across the floor to evade, Iruki entered Closer's embrace. Then he swung his fist with his slender wrist.

Closer was dumbfounded. With both Earth Skin and Earth Rise active, only the fist would be hurt.

"Ugh!"

Contrary to expectation, a solid impact hit his abdomen, and a light groan escaped Closer's lips.

Closer's pupils shook with shock. Though the power was mediocre, all the defensive magic surrounding him had disappeared.

"H-how...?"

Iruki leaped up in a crane-mimicking martial arts stance. Then he stabbed at Closer's eyes with two fingers.

"Hyah!"

"Argh! My eyes!"

Momentarily losing his sight, Closer hastily cast Earth Rise. But it was the same again. Just as the magic seemed to activate, it was canceled as if time was flowing backwards.

Tok. Clatter.

The recorder watching the battle dropped his pen, unable to take his eyes off Iruki.

"...Cancellation?"

Cancellation magic.

Regardless of power, it was magic of the highest difficulty level that canceled a mage's omniscience.

Magic textbooks commonly explain Cancellation by comparing it to a glass cup.

When you drop a glass cup on the floor, can the shattered fragments restore themselves?

The answer is 'yes.'

Yet no one has ever witnessed such a phenomenon because the probability is extremely low.

Since time began at the dawn of creation, this world has been moving from a stable state to an unstable state.

That's why when you drop a glass cup, it breaks due to nearly infinite variables.

But among those infinite cases, there's just one: if the direction and speed of forces acting at the moment of breaking were perfectly reversed, the glass cup could restore itself.

In reality, breaking is merely the severing of molecular bonds, so if forces are reversed at the atomic level, perfect restoration without a single crack is possible.

Mages call this the 'returned glass cup.'

Iruki infiltrated Closer's Spirit Zone with his separation form Spirit Zone to analyze the mental changes occurring.

Then he reversed the patterns generated by specific magic into equations, successfully achieving the returned glass cup.

It required calculation abilities that ordinary humans couldn't even imitate. This was why 72 percent of mages capable of using Cancellation were Servant Syndrome ability holders.

"Argh! So annoying!"

Closer flailed his arms in frustration. Abandoning defense entirely, he cast Heavy Stone, and over ten rocks formed in midair through transmutation.

Iruki pointed with his finger, applying Cancellation to each one. Then the earth-clumping process reversed as if time was flowing backwards, and they vanished.

"Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!"

Iruki stubbornly deployed martial arts. To observers, it might look like he was mocking Closer, but he was actually serious.

Striking Closer's bridge of the nose, twin streams of nosebleed erupted.

There was no way to respond to magic being forcibly canceled. It was like a mage fighting an ordinary person.

How terrifying Cancellation magic was showed clearly in the teachers' expressions. Even if it was just a student, if they had mastered cancellation magic, the story was different.

"I knew he was outstanding, but when did he develop such an ability..."

"Environmental influence must be significant. After all, Iruki's father is..."

Mercandine Albino, head of the Thunder Dragons.

Though he seemed careless, it was known that few people in the kingdom knew what he was really thinking.

Since Servants had the potential to become supreme in Anti-Magic and Cancellation, the great Albino would certainly have trained him from childhood.

"Not all Servants have quick thinking like Iruki. If managed well, he'll reach an unparalleled realm someday."

Like clothes getting soaked in drizzle, after taking countless hits from Iruki's small fists, his bones ached.

Closer's face was a mess. His eyelids were swollen, blood dripped from his nose, and his split lips hurt whenever he moved.
