"I won't let this slide! I don't care about the duel anymore!"

Closer abandoned magic and charged in. Surely he wouldn't lose to Iruki in a physical fight? But that very thought was proof that he had lost his reason.

The moment Closer threw his punch, an explosion reaching 10 kilobusters erupted. His mental strength gauge plummeted as his knees hit the ground. If his synchronization rate hadn't been 50 percent, it would have been instant death.

Closer looked up at Iruki with a dazed expression. Immediately, a straight punch flew and struck his nose. Now even the slightest touch was painful.

Tears welled up in Closer's eyes.

"Argh!"

"Well, shall we start making an orc?"

When Iruki said this while flexing his knuckles, Closer suddenly came to his senses and raised his hands.

"W-wait! I admit it! I lost...!"

Iruki's powerful punch crushed his nose. Closer's heavy upper body tilted backward as he struck the back of his head on the ground.

Iruki also frowned and shook his hand. It seemed that hitting people wasn't something just anyone could do.

"Ow, my fist."

When Ethella declared victory, the students burst into cheers as if they had been waiting.

Mark and Maria were especially overjoyed. They had beaten that detestable Closer to a pulp, so it felt like a painful tooth had been pulled.

'Amazing. Shirone's friends are incredible too.'

Iruki was certainly an amazing upperclassman, but Mark had never respected him from the heart. He just thought of him as another common genius with savant syndrome—someone who received biological advantages.

But now it was different. His skill in toying with Closer, who was renowned throughout the Kingdom, couldn't be denied.

Though Iruki was unpopular at school, he was now receiving flirtatious glances from numerous girls. It seemed many people had grievances against Closer, like Maria.

"You're so cool, Iruki! You're the best!"

"That's right! Wow, he's so handsome!"

Iruki shrugged his shoulders, then stepped on the unconscious Closer's cheek with his right foot. He calmly made a V sign with his fingers, sending a victory signal.

The cheering stopped abruptly. No matter how much they hated him, to step on a defeated opponent's head? That twisted personality would never be fixed.

Ceriel, who had been watching the battle without even breathing, swallowed her saliva and asked Amy.

"Shirone and his friends... they said they're coming up next year, right?"

"Yeah. I think that's what they said."

"Right. I need to graduate this year no matter what. If all of them come up to the graduating class, it'll really be competitive hell."

Ceriel was also a skilled student who had established herself stably in the graduating class. But her words couldn't be taken as just a joke.

Indeed, most of the graduating class wasn't laughing.

They were only sending wary and cautious glances toward the promising competitors who would block their graduation in the future.

'Well, I should be careful too. I felt it before, but... he really is an amazing kid.'

There was a time when Iruki had visited during his Class Five days. They had exchanged a few words, but the talk was so preposterous that she seemed to have dismissed it.

But thinking about it now, those preposterous words must have been reality for Iruki.

Shirone and Nade ran to Iruki with shocked faces. Especially Shirone had no choice but to admit that the secret weapon to defeat him wasn't just empty talk.

Of course, calculating the returned glass cup was extremely difficult, but once the analysis was complete, no mage would want to fight Iruki.

"Iruki, that was really amazing. I got goosebumps watching."

"Right. When did you practice this, keeping it secret from us?"

"Today was the first time I actually used it. During the break, my father kept me captive and I solved formulas to death. I thought I could do well in actual combat, and when I tried it, it worked out easily as expected."

Normally they would have hit his head for showing off, but today they couldn't hate him.

With this, the match was tied, achieving the desired result of sending Shirone to face Dante.

While Sabina was waking up the unconscious Closer, Dante walked over. But the person he spoke to wasn't Shirone, but Iruki.

"Good match. Cancellation. It was impressive."

"It's troublesome if you say that already. My duel will be even more impressive."

Dante snorted. Cancellation was the highest level that even professionals found impossible. In the end, the number one in the advanced class wasn't Boyle or Shirone. It was Iruki.

"I thought it was over when you left the Royal Magic School, but talent really doesn't die. That makes it even more regrettable. It would have been a better duel if I had faced you instead."

It was as if Shirone wasn't even in his consideration. In fact, he was thinking that promoting a rematch with Iruki might help with publicity.

"I understand what you mean. But with such complacent thinking, it'll be hard to beat Shirone, won't it?"

"Haha! Me? To this country bumpkin? Someone of your level should know. That will never happen."

"Do you know why I left Bashka? Because I thought there was no one there who could stop me."

Dante's expression crumpled. It was a statement that insulted not only himself but the entire Royal Magic School.

"I don't know about now, but that's what I thought at the time. That there was no one who could control the dangerous material inside my head."

"So? Are you saying there's such a person here?"

"I met two people. One refused, but one accepted. That's Shirone. I don't care what impression you got, but if you think this is the best with just this much, you'll taste the worst feeling in next week's duel."

Dante turned his gaze to Shirone. Why did everyone rate this kid so highly?

At first, he thought it was simply because he was an Unlocker. But a genius capable of using Cancellation wouldn't judge by such low standards.

The students listening to their conversation stirred.

That Shirone was the person who could stop Iruki's rampage was revealed during last semester's Speed Gun test. But Iruki said he had met two people.

"Who could the other person be?"

"Isn't it Amy? There were rumors before that Iruki was targeting Amy."

Besides Amy, several other names came up, but it was impossible to know without Iruki revealing it.

Anyway, the second duel concluded with Iruki's complete victory.

The hearts of students returning to their dormitories were pounding. Next week would be the highlight of the big match—the duel between Shirone and Dante.

While they supported Shirone in their hearts, objectively they had no choice but to favor Dante.

A brilliant record of 472 wins and 472 matches. Next week seemed like time would flow slowly.

@

The long-awaited day had finally arrived.

From morning, the school was busy welcoming new guests.

Students organized their dormitories, washed themselves, and wore their best clothes.

Correspondent Killine from the teachers' council entered Alpheas Magic School, accompanied by a video recorder. Seeing students already gathered at the Advanced Practice Hall, a smile crossed her lips.

'Even for a rural school, Dante's reputation is outstanding. There are still hours before it starts.'

Killine cut through the line between Mark and Maria waiting and entered the practice hall.

"Excuse me. I'm a correspondent. I'll go in first."

Maria looked at her with curious eyes.

"Wow, that person is Killine. I only heard her name in academic journals, but she's more beautiful than I thought."

"Hmph, she's said to be a hardcore Dante follower anyway. She's practically an enemy to us."

As the duel time approached, the practice hall was opened. Shirone also waited in line with his friends at the entrance before entering.

Despite being called an unofficial duel, the stage was lavishly decorated. The rumor that they had called an event company last night to decorate seemed to be true.

The smooth physical blocks were spotless, and torches were even installed to create atmosphere.

A video recording device was installed in a position where the entire practice hall could be seen at a glance. Unlike optical cameras that captured momentary records, this was a device that could capture the flow of time.

According to Nade's explanation, the optical crystal used in the video recorder was something called Obscura B, which was 200 times more expensive than the Obscura A used in optical cameras.

It was a mineral that occurred in ultra-low temperature dark rooms, and its value was high because it couldn't be synthesized through alchemy.

As such, Obscura B was handled by the state, and approval from related agencies was required for its use.

"In short, the Kingdom decided that Shirone's duel was worth recording. If you win this duel, your name will really become known throughout the entire Kingdom."

While Nade was excited as if it were his own affair, Iruki coldly faced reality.

"The approval probably came down to record Dante, not Shirone. There aren't many mages who can handle information magic as well as Dante. They're probably thinking of using it as educational material for the Royal Magic School."

"Tch! Whatever, it doesn't matter, right? Shirone's going to win. Right, Shirone?"

Shirone wanted to smile for him, but his lips wouldn't lift easily. Soon he would face Dante. He was determined to do his best, but his opponent wasn't someone he could be confident about the outcome against.

On the way, they met Canis and Arin. They usually said they weren't interested, but it seemed today's duel had sparked their curiosity.

The front seats of the Advanced Practice Hall were reserved for teachers and officials, so Mark and Maria had saved seats in the second row. Amy and Ceriel had also claimed seats early.

When Shirone walked over, Mark bowed politely.

"Good morning!"

"Shirone! Shirone's here!"

Ceriel ran over like a dog greeting its owner, grabbed Shirone's hand and brought him over, while Amy examined Shirone's face. He wasn't nervous, but he didn't look relaxed either.

Canis, who had been following behind Shirone, saw Amy and raised his hand. Since returning from Heaven, they had been busy with each other, so while they had acknowledged each other in passing, this was the first time seeing each other in one place.

"Hey, pumpkin. Long time no see."

"Where do you get off calling a graduating class student that? Don't you call me senior?"

The two who had been rivals even in Heaven were the same at school.

"Don't be so uptight. Then should Arin call me senior too?"

Indeed, Arin couldn't figure out how to greet them.

"Of course Arin is an exception! Looking at you, you keep trying to get involved with Arin, but that doesn't work on me!"

Shirone stepped in to mediate.

"Come on, come on. It would be nice if everyone got along well. But why do you two fight every time you meet?"

Canis and Amy pointed at each other and shouted.

"They pick a fight first!"

Shirone forgot about the tension of the duel and burst out laughing. Well, it was a bad relationship that started when Arcane invaded the school. Just maintaining a friendship was quite forgiving.

Mark and Maria, who were distant underclassmen, couldn't join the conversation and watched from afar.

Gathered together, the Shirone line was also top class in the school. At least in Mark's eyes, those seven people felt like a walking army.

Then another group that could be called an army—Dante's party—approached from across the way.

Mark, who had been glaring at them, burst into a chuckle. It was quite different from their momentum when they first transferred.

Sabina looked somewhat dispirited, and Closer had bandages stuck all over his face.

'Hehe. Serves them right, idiots. That's why you shouldn't mess with the Shirone line.'

Dante first fixed his gaze on Amy. Rather than being conscious of her, she was so beautiful that he had no choice. She didn't actually emit light, but she felt vivid in a way only she did.

The Karmis family of red eyes. Moreover, she was the overwhelming number one who had crushed Boyle and Pandora before entering the graduating class. If someone had to be welcomed as a queen here, no one was as perfect as her.

"Hello. I've heard much about the Karmis family's reputation. I'm Dante of Airhine."

"Right. Work hard and I hope you get good results."
