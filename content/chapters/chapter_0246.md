Dante was bewildered. He hadn't expected a particularly friendly attitude, but he had at least hoped for some special reaction to meeting the nation's top student, whether good or bad. However, Amy only offered the same ordinary pleasantries she would give to any other underclassman.

"Is that all? Honestly, I'd like to hear some praise at least. After all, I'm going to win anyway."

Angered by his words, Seriel grabbed Amy and Sirone's wrists and forced them to hold hands.

"Don't be ridiculous! She's already done enough for someone who's fighting against her boyfriend! Amy is definitely on Sirone's side, so wake up from your dream!"

This was the first time Dante had heard such a thing. Come to think of it, he had never asked who Sirone's girlfriend was. He clearly didn't seem like the type to get along with girls.

"Is that really true, Amy-seonbae?"

"Yes. It's true."

Amy's confirmation left Dante with a sour expression.

"Student Sirone! Student Dante! This way! We need to do interviews, so come quickly!"

A faculty council official called the two over. The schedule included interviews before the showdown.

As Sirone followed the official, he said, "Well, I'll be back. Let's meet after it's over. Don't leave first, wait for me."

Dante silently walked behind Sirone. Honestly, he felt like he'd been hit, so he wasn't in the mood to provoke anyone. How could Amy possibly be dating a country bumpkin like Sirone?

'Hmph, she'll end up being my woman anyway. I'll crush him to pieces in this match.'

While he wasn't the type to chase after women like Closer, having a beautiful and intelligent woman by his side made a man stand out.

In that sense, Amy was a woman who belonged at his side. She wasn't suited to be with some country boy.

Dante couldn't hide his curiosity as he observed Sirone.

He had gone around collecting various information, but everyone he asked said Sirone was the best.

What impressed him most was that even while saying such things, they didn't seem to have hurt pride or feel displeased.

'How can such a mild guy be considered the best? Is he still hiding something?'

Canis had said there was nothing good that would come from messing with Sirone. Iruki had said only Sirone could control him.

Amy, the school's top prodigy, was Sirone's girlfriend.

Mark and Maria didn't withdraw their respectful gazes from Sirone even in front of Dante's name.

At that moment... his heart began to race. It was a type of tension he had never experienced before.

He couldn't understand anything. The more information he gathered, the more blurred Sirone as a person became.

Just who was Sirone?

Dante arrived at the back of the practice hall with an unsettled mind. The teachers' interviews weren't finished yet, as Killine was asking questions next to Thad while the video recorder was filming.

With each incoming question, Thad's face was becoming more like blank paper. He thought the skin might become so transparent that bones would show through.

"I think the odds between Dante and Sirone are 5 to 5. But if variables come into play, I'd say about 6 to 4."

"I see. Thank you."

Killine turned away as if there was nothing more to see. Not only was the content lacking in substance, but filming a nervous person's face was useless.

And 5 to 5? In her mind, Dante was 10 and Sirone was 0. Of course, for the article she'd probably report it as 9 to 1.

Killine approached Ethella, who was waiting for her turn. She too seemed inexperienced in such situations, showing her awkwardness.

"Ahaha! That's right. Sirone is such a good child. Oh, Dante is also an excellent student. I hope everyone can get along harmoniously as one, ahahaha!"

"...Yes. I understand. Thank you for your kind words."

When Killine cut the interview short, Ethella let out a sigh of relief. Thad, realizing he had failed, approached Ethella and pretended to cry.

Their articles would never see the light of day.

Killine was getting irritated. She had made full preparations thinking this was one of the five prestigious schools, but every teacher she met lacked sense.

She decided to pin her hopes on Siena, who was last in line, and if that didn't work out, she'd have to cut the teacher interviews entirely.

"Hello, Teacher Siena. I'm Killine from the faculty council."

"Yes, I'm Olivia Siena."

Siena nodded toward the video recorder with her characteristically cold expression.

Killine's eyes lit up as if she had finally found what she was looking for.

'Oh ho, good looks, good expression. This one might work.'

Siena answered the incoming questions without hesitation. Since she was conveying her thoughts as they were, there was no reason to be nervous.

"I see. Thank you for your thoughtful words. Then let me ask just one more question. You're serving as judge today. Between Dante and Sirone, who do you think will be the victor?"

Asking a teacher about their students' victory or defeat was cruel, but thinking up such questions was Killine's job.

The crueler it was, the more entertaining it was for viewers. Students across the nation bought academic journals to read articles like this.

After thinking for a moment, Siena answered leisurely.

"Personally, I think Dante has the advantage. About 7 to 3? However, whoever wins, that doesn't determine a mage's level. Limiting magic to combat is an anachronistic and barbaric way of thinking."

"Ah... I see. Thank you for today's interview."

Siena gave a light bow and disappeared from the video recorder's focus. Even her exit was refined, making Thad want to cry even more. On the other hand, Ethella exclaimed in admiration.

"Wow, that's amazing. I was so nervous I couldn't say anything."

"Tch, she's from the Olivia school. How could she understand the desperation of a nameless teacher like me?"

"Fufu, no. Teacher Thad did well too."

Ethella patted his back. But having watched her interview, Thad found no comfort in it at all.

Killine finally walked toward today's main characters.

Dante had priority first, with Sirone second.

Considering the time remaining until the match, the person who finished their interview first could gain some time to collect their thoughts.

"Dante, you can do well today, right? I'll write a great article for you, so make it flashy."

"Haha! Don't worry. When have I ever not been flashy?"

"How can you speak so beautifully too? Well, let's start the interview."

Killine's smile disappeared and serious questions followed. Dante also answered skillfully, adding his characteristic wit. He seemed to know even the angles that would make his face look good on camera.

"Yes, it's according to Master Olivia's will. I think spreading the capital's advanced magic to regional communities is a good way to narrow the skill gap between magic schools."

"Oh my, but isn't that a loss for you, Dante?"

"Haha! Not at all. When the overall level rises, I get more fired up. And after this semester, I'll be entering the graduating class. Now I need to become a professional."

"As expected of the kingdom's top prospect, such confident words. Then lastly, you've overwhelmed countless opponents with crushing margins so far - what about today's match? Can we look forward to it?"

"First of all, Sirone is an Unlocker. And he's talented too. It'll probably be a good match. But as always, the victor will be me. Today I'll show you the essence of information magic."

"Thank you for the interview. I'll look forward to good results. Now, let's interview Sirone next. Sirone, could you come this way please?"

"Ah, yes!"

Sirone, who had thought he'd have time to prepare after Dante finished, had been caught off guard and suddenly snapped to attention. Standing in front of the video recorder, he could deeply feel the teachers' emotions.

Dante's interview in particular had been hypocritical enough to include praise for his opponent. Sirone couldn't figure out whether he should say what Killine wanted to hear or speak his honest feelings.

"Um... So. Yes. I enrolled in magic school this year."

"So the rumors were true! There was a reason Dante acknowledged you as a worthy opponent. Then what do you think of Dante? Having gotten the opportunity to face the kingdom's top student, do you feel lucky?"

Most of what came from Killine's mouth were questions related to Dante. But Sirone didn't have time to feel dissatisfied. Just thinking of words to say was overwhelming under her pressing gaze.

"Ah, yes. I don't like fighting, but getting this opportunity is a good thing."

Killine sighed internally.

'What are you doing using "good" twice? It makes you look inarticulate. This kid won't become a star either.'

No one had ever beaten Dante, but there were quite a few students who had made their names known by clinging to his star power.

But Sirone was unmistakably a country boy. His looks were decent so he might work if dressed up, but with such an inarticulate attitude, he couldn't appeal to the girls of Bashka.

Dante, who had been listening to Sirone's interview, turned away as if there was nothing more to see.

Meanwhile, Killine threw out her final question.

"I can't not ask for Sirone's thoughts. Many experts are predicting Sirone's defeat - what do you think about that?"

"Um... I cannot acknowledge Dante."

The emotion disappeared from Killine's smiling face, leaving only its form. Dante also stopped walking and turned around.

"Dante seems to not know what's really important. I don't care how famous he became in the capital or who he beat to climb to this position. A mage isn't simply a magician who lights fires and freezes water. The spirit that pursues intelligence - that is magic. No matter how amazing magic he casts, if he's a mage whose spirit is fundamentally wrong, I don't think I could lose to him. No, I absolutely will not lose to such a mage."

Even Killine, who had been through everything, lost her timing for about 0.5 seconds at Sirone's bombshell declaration.

Her words followed belatedly.

"Wow, wow! The challenger's fighting spirit is amazing! I hope Sirone also has good results. This has been faculty council correspondent Killine."

Dante fixed his gaze on Sirone as he walked away. A steel-like spirit hidden behind that articulateness. Seeming to sway this way and that, but with a flexibility whose form never changed.

'I see. So that was you?'

For the first time, Dante began to see Sirone.

The spectator seats were packed.

The front row belonged to the teachers, with only two seats in the center empty. Anyone could tell who would sit there without looking.

"Hehehe, Olivia really has impressive skills."

At the entrance of Alpheas and Olivia, the teachers stood up.

The students in the back also stood up without knowing why, making the crowd's skyline ripple like waves.

Alpheas, seated in his designated spot, looked around left and right, then seemed to get a good idea as he grabbed the chair's armrest and pulled it forward.

"My eyes are getting dim. I need to watch from closer."

At this absurd action that turned everyone in the first row into the second row, Olivia approached with a reddened face.

"What kind of behavior is this? Being embarrassing in front of everyone."

"Keke, don't be like that, come to the front. The view is good."

"Am I crazy? To act the same as someone like you?"

"Then don't mind me and go back."

As Alpheas acted like a good-for-nothing, Olivia snorted angrily. Then she turned coldly away and pulled her own chair over to sit next to Alpheas.

If she just left him alone, there might be articles about how the great Alpheas had gone senile.

Alpheas put one leg up on the opposite knee and waited for the match in a slouched position. Olivia frowned at his appearance, which was disagreeable from one to ten.

"Sit up straight. You're a principal, for goodness sake. Do you think this is some underground fighting arena?"

"Keke, my blood's boiling after so long."

"What are you going to do if your blood boils when you're all old? Really, men. Our photos are going to be in the academic journal. Sit up quickly. Sit properly."

Then Alpheas reclined his upper body completely and rested his arm on the armrest, propping his chin. Thinking that he never listened to her words even back when he was her student, Olivia glared at him coldly. On the other hand, Alpheas's eyes seemed to have fire burning in them. Caught up in old memories for a moment at that sight, she pouted her lips.

"You're not actually expecting something, are you? It's a match Dante has no choice but to win anyway."

"You never know, do you? And I'm not sitting here to cheer for anyone in particular. If Sirone loses, I think that would be a good result in its own way."

"What kind of senile talk is that?"
