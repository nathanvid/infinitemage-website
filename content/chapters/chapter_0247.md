"Shirone is a strong child. He's not the type to be discouraged by losing once, and he'll be able to gain something even greater through defeat. A true teacher must also teach how to learn from failure."

Olivia raised her hand as if to block Alpheas's voice.

"I understand that as the excuses of a Class Four loser."

"Hehe, anyway, today I'm just a spectator. Shirone and Dante. This should be really interesting."

Finally, the time for the confrontation had arrived.

When Siena, who was serving as referee, walked to the center of the Advanced Practice Hall, the atmosphere in the arena became solemn.

In a moment, Alpheas Magic School's greatest talent would clash with the Kingdom's greatest talent.

Mark, who had been trembling as if suffering from shortness of breath, looked over at Iruki beside him.

"Ugh, I feel like my blood is drying up. Senior, do you think Senior Shirone can win?"

"I think both of them will have at least one chance each. Shirone has more variety in attack magic, but Dante's tactical operation can't be ignored either. Once the number of magic circles increases, that's when even Shirone will find his hands tied."

Even from Iruki's mouth, who could be called his closest confidant, no optimistic diagnosis emerged. Mark was about to speak with a tearful expression when suddenly the students burst into cheers.

Shirone and Dante were climbing up to the sides of the Advanced Practice Hall.

Referee Siena paid her respects to both the former and current headmasters, then called Shirone and Dante to the center of the Advanced Practice Hall.

The faces of students who had been watching the meeting of the two with interest turned pale. Shirone was approaching Dante beyond the regulated position.

'Oh no!'

Shirone hurriedly came to his senses and stopped walking. But Dante's face was already right in front of him. It was because he had been thinking deeply and hadn't paid attention.

The students understood Shirone's action as provocation and became even more excited, but his friends who knew Shirone's personality thought differently.

He was definitely nervous.

At this unusual situation, Killine laughed as if feeling sorry for him.

"Hoho! What to do? In what era do we live for such cheap provocation?"

There had been many challengers who acted like that against Dante before. Each time, Dante would leisurely counter and actually embarrass his opponent.

'Hehe, Dante. What kind of performance will you start with today... huh?'

A question arose on Killine's face. Dante was also staring at Shirone without even moving a muscle.

Siena was explaining the rules, but they couldn't even feel like it was entering their ears.

Since they had never seen such behavior before, Dante's friends were equally puzzled.

Sabina bit her nails and said, "Doesn't Dante seem a bit nervous?"

"That's not like him. He was in good condition until this morning, wasn't he? Let's wait a bit. That might be showmanship too."

Iruki, who had been listening to their conversation, said, "He has no choice but to be nervous."

"What? He has no choice but to be nervous?"

Mark turned his head with shocked eyes. His anxiety had reached its peak, so he was startled by whatever Iruki said.

"Shirone has never lost in competition. Although the period he's been learning magic is short, precisely because of that, he's overcome high-difficulty barriers continuously to get here. Of course, Dante has also built an almost impossible record from his long time on the throne. These two people are going to clash."

Amy said, "Defeat is a record carved into a person's life. It changes the direction of one's life in some way. But neither of them has experienced defeat yet. An abnormal career that's only possible by not allowing even a single mistake. They don't want to lose that."

Iruki continued, "And today, one of their careers will be completely finished. They'll live with the record of defeat carved into their lives."

Mark was stunned. Is this the world that geniuses live in? He, who had defeat carved into him at the mere age of fifteen, couldn't even grasp such a realm.

But he didn't feel regretful at all. He just hoped that Shirone, who had beaten him, would win again, and his heart was beating painfully fast.

"Ugh. This is driving me crazy. When exactly are they going to start?"

Siena, who had explained the rules, instructed them to create distance. But no one moved. They seemed unable to hear.

"You two? Please return to your designated positions and wait."

All kinds of thoughts crossed through Dante's mind. Who exactly is this boy? At first he said he didn't want to fight, that he needed neither power nor honor, but now he was glaring as if he would devour him.

'No. Let's not think.'

Dante suddenly came to his senses. Since he hadn't lost in 472 battles, it could be expected that he wouldn't lose in the future either. Just like any other challenger, he just had to crush him.

"Shirone! Dante! Follow the referee's instructions!"

Only after Siena shouted fiercely did the two come to their senses and retreat without avoiding each other's gaze.

Dante, who had reached his designated position, took a deep breath and moved his body to relieve tension.

The 60-meter distance seemed farther than usual.

But he had defeated all the notable strong opponents to get here. If he fought as usual, there was no way he could lose this confrontation.

'Right, I just need to fight my way. His only option would be a preemptive strike. Let's use that in reverse. As a target-type, I have the advantage in speed.'

He would accelerate the four-way type to maximum and deploy a spatial teleportation magic circle under Shirone's feet. There wouldn't be any significant impact, but there was no better method to disrupt balance. Then he would just handle the situation as he had always done.

"Then, from now on, Shirone and Dante, Dante and Shirone's..."

Siena's words were drowned out by loud cheers.

The collision would happen in 10 seconds.

Due to the heat, even the air temperature seemed to rise.

Siena gave up on conveying signals through voice and raised her hand. Then the students' cheers became even louder, and Shirone and Dante's gazes fixed on the hand signal.

"Match start!"

Dante deployed ultra-high-speed sequence magic. The number that started at 1 reached 10,000, and the target-type Spirit Zone extended out to engulf Shirone.

'Got it...!'

The moment he thought that, Dante's eyes widened. Dozens of Photon Cannons had somehow reached right in front of his nose.

Dante switched his omniscience and deployed a defensive magic circle. The Photon Cannons spread like a barrage pounded against the magic circle. Only then did he realize how the situation was unfolding.

'Immortal Function!'

He had opened Immortal Function from the very start. Moreover, regardless of tactical operation, he was relentlessly firing Photon Cannons without rest.

The physical force was equivalent to earth magic, and the speed was fast too. When actually experiencing it, it was an annoyingly serious magic.

Every time the defensive magic circle cracked, he accumulated information to repair it, but he couldn't hold out any longer.

When Dante escaped his position with Teleportation, Shirone, who had been rapidly firing Photon Cannons, also cast photonization magic and pursued him.

Two streams of light decorated the sky above the Advanced Practice Hall.

Students were mesmerized by the fierce battle that unfolded from the startâ€”no, the one-sided display of firepower.

Iruki let out a deflated laugh.

Of course, it was a good strategy. But he hadn't expected Shirone, with his cautious personality, to stake everything on the early phase like this.

"The plan is to prevent him from even attempting to deploy magic circles from the very beginning."

Mark asked in a trembling voice, "This is incredible. Is the person fighting now really the same person who had a Teleportation duel with me last semester?"

"Probably not. Anyway, not giving him time to deploy techniques means Shirone is also serious. If it goes like this, the outcome is uncertain."

Shirone pressured Dante with dazzling movement. After blocking left and right with Patrol technique, he cast Rainbow Drop in reverse and soared into the sky. Dozens of photon masses born several times per second under his feet followed in a chain.

Shirone fired them all. When Photon Cannons dominated the space, Dante descended to the ground, the only escape route, and fled. Air-to-ground bombardment followed, but he had no desire to look up at the sky.

'Damn! Let me use some magic too! That guy was completely crazy!'

No, this might actually be better.

He couldn't maintain Immortal Function for a long time anyway. If he could safely get through the initial offensive, his victory would be assured without question.

'Right, in this state, it'll last 30 minutes at most. If I can just endure for 30 minutes...!'

Photon Cannons fell in a line, scraping the ground. Dante changed direction while checking Shirone's position.

Dozens of photon masses were pouring down from where he expected Shirone to be.

Dante felt chills when he realized his mistake.

'Damn! 30 minutes my ass, I can't even last 5 minutes!'

After blocking the first bombardment with a defensive magic circle, he broke through the gap created by the delay of the second bombardment to escape the barrage. But there was nowhere left to move. Without realizing it, he had been pushed to the outer edge of the Advanced Practice Hall.

Shirone occupied space with Patrol technique and drove Dante to the end of the corner. Then, when it seemed like Dante might escape, he threw compressed photons in his hand. A linear flash extended out.

Unable to escape the corner after all, Dante hastily deployed a defensive magic circle. A sense of weight completely different from the previous attacks was transmitted.

When the second and third attacks collided at the same spot, cracks appeared even while repairing the magic circle.

Iruki smiled sympathetically.

"No matter how nervous he was, did his head freeze up too? After facing this much, he should know. There's no way a hastily constructed magic circle could block this."

When the magic circle protecting Dante shattered into pieces, Shirone charged in a straight line as if compressing space into a point.

Dante chose to give up evasion and buy time to prepare instead. When he deployed magic circles in all directions to block the approach, Shirone bent his waist and cast Photon Burst.

"Grrgh!"

As 30 curtains per second pulsed and pounded the magic circles, Dante felt like his mind was being torn to shreds.

He had seen Photon Burst during tactical training, but since it was only used defensively, he had wondered how powerful it could be. But experiencing it directly, this was practically area destruction magic.

All seven magic circles broke and his mind shook. Dante, covering his face, looked ahead over his wrist.

But Shirone was nowhere to be seen.

The moment he lowered his gaze, his eyes met with Shirone, who was crouched down with photons compressed in his hand.

Shirone burrowed into Dante's embrace and swung his hand. The afterimage of photons stretched out like a tail.

Two seconds was enough time for a mage to enhance power. Dante had no time to think of anything else and deployed a defensive magic circle.

The Photon Cannon thrown from ultra-close range struck the magic circle, shattered it in one blow, and hit his abdomen.

Dante felt dizzy for a moment. However, after quickly checking his condition, the impact wasn't that great.

'Tch! Still managed to block it roughly! From now on...!'

At that moment, Shirone extended both hands to grab Dante's collar and cast photonization magic. With no time to wonder at the unexpected close combat, Dante became light and moved.

When the photonization magic was released in a state where he couldn't distinguish where was where, Dante searched for Shirone's position first.

When he looked behind, Shirone was nowhere to be seen, and countless photon bullets filled his vision.

KWAAAAANG!

As Photon Cannons struck, the spot where Dante had been blazed with white light. Students filtered the photons pouring into their retinas with their fingers, but still couldn't confirm the situation.

Shirone stopped attacking and caught his breath. Only 5 minutes had passed since the battle began.

Dante had seven magic circles deployed in front and was covering his face with both arms. But soon the light of the magic circles dimmed and shattered like glass. One of Dante's knees buckled and struck the floor with a thud.

The students' eyes shook with shock. Although he had deployed magic circles, he clearly hadn't blocked it perfectly.

Iruki's eyes lit up.

"Finally got through. This one had impact."

Dante was famous for never losing the initiative under any circumstances.

Once he entered battle, his style was to neutralize the opponent's attacks with genius-level operation and then finish with a counter.

But Shirone had broken through that iron-wall defense and succeeded in what could be called an effective strike.

Among the 500 people gathered at the battle site, no one spoke a word. Not only Killine, who had watched Dante since childhood, but even his friends had expressions of disbelief.

472 battles, 472 victories.

Dante, who boasted an undefeated record, had been brought to his knees by his opponent in just 5 minutes. As if revealing the violence of battle, rough wind swept through the Advanced Practice Hall.
