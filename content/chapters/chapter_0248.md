Silence fell where the sound of wind had passed.

The students were speechless. In the storm-like offensive that Shirone had unleashed in just 5 minutes, Dante—called the Kingdom's greatest talent—had been brought to his knees.

"What? Is it real? That Dante..."

One student shot up and shouted.

"Shirone knocked him down! He knocked down Dante!"

As if on cue, the Advanced Practice Hall filled with cheers.

"Wasn't it too one-sided? He was no match from the beginning, right?"

"Even Dante can't help it when he goes up against Shirone. I knew Shirone would win from the start!"

Students threw in their comments one after another. Among all the students at the Kingdom's magic school, Dante's defensive ability was rated as the best. For such a Dante to be beaten without even being able to properly counterattack against Shirone's offensive was naturally exciting.

If a defense wall is breached once, wouldn't it be breached a second time?

The duel wasn't over yet, but judging from the battle so far, the momentum already seemed to have shifted to Shirone.

As countless people's emotions boiled over, hot fighting spirit soared high into the sky. The people maintaining cool minds were Alpheas and Olivia, the hidden protagonists of this confrontation.

Even for these two, the early development was unexpected. Olivia hadn't expected Dante to fall to his knees so easily, and Alpheas was surprised by Shirone's lightning offensive.

But this is the world of magic. No, even if it weren't magic, all competition that exists in the world is inevitably relative.

"A magician is..."

Alpheas chose his words carefully, as if defining something important.

"A human who is inhuman."

"..."

Olivia held her words. From the moment Dante took a hit, there was no conversation to be had with him.

"Most humans can't even enter the Spirit Zone. Since they've entered magic school, we can safely say they've surpassed the realm of ordinary people."

Olivia's eyes sharpened. If you reversed Alpheas's words, it meant that even the renowned Dante was merely a magic school student.

"So what? Dante hasn't lost yet."

Alpheas ignored this and continued speaking.

"But... when you gather children who have transcended the human category, a very interesting phenomenon occurs. Among them, someone transcends once again. They compete at an even higher level, and there someone else stands out again."

Contrary to Olivia's expectation, Alpheas hadn't brought this up to disparage Dante. Through the duel between two students who had transcended ordinary people, he was reflecting on his own life.

"At the end of that climb, when there's no more room to go up. That would be the realm of a First-Class Great Magician, wouldn't it?"

Alpheas looked back at Olivia with a hint of laughter. She was lost in thought with a sullen expression. It was a cute look that didn't match her age.

Olivia finally opened her mouth.

"...Are you looking down on me for being Second-Class right now?"

Alpheas didn't answer and turned his head toward the Advanced Practice Hall.

How could he look down on a Second-Class Great Magician?

But if you think about it... among the magicians who have risen to that position, there's no one who would be satisfied with their place.

Once you've entered the realm of Great Magician, anyone would run toward First-Class.

They just couldn't climb there.

Students, professionals, Second-Class Great Magicians—none can avoid competition.

To take one more step forward from the pool they belong to, they must wage a lonely battle for their entire lives. That's the world of magic.

Alpheas had once dreamed of becoming a First-Class Great Magician too.

The future was unknown, but there was a time when both he and others expected it would likely happen.

But after losing his wife Erina and wandering for 10 years, his sharpness had disappeared.

If he had started over from that point, could he have become a First-Class magician?

Alpheas could assert it was impossible.

First-Class wasn't like that. Having wasted 10 years, it wasn't a position one could aim for by overtaking countless geniuses.

Then what about Olivia?

She was a smart woman and hadn't lived as dissolute a life as he had. Rather, after failing in love, she had honed her magic even more ruthlessly with thoughts of revenge.

Alpheas wanted to know. Just how close had Olivia come to witnessing the brilliant glory of that position?

"You didn't fail to make an effort, did you?"

Alpheas's question was incoherent. But Olivia could understand immediately. She too was a magician.

Olivia blinked her long eyelashes and fell into calm thought. Then she stuck out her lower lip and said:

"First-Class. That's not a realm you can reach just by doing your best. No, I don't know. Maybe there are people in the world who tried harder than me. But at least in my opinion, it's a realm of absolute talent."

Olivia retraced the years that had passed to see how credible her answer was. Then she recalled an overlooked fact and slowly added:

"Or... a realm of madness."

Alpheas's eyes half-closed. Deep wrinkles formed around his eyes and the light in his pupils was sucked into an abyss.

"You mean Gaold."

Mikea Gaold, a graduate of Alpheas Magic School and Chairman of the Tormia Magic Association.

During his school days, no one thought he would become a First-Class Great Magician.

They thought he would become a good person.

He was truly a kind child. As a devout believer, he was a student who said his dream was to preach love to the world.

Now that same person had become the Kingdom's greatest Great Magician and was positioned at the pinnacle of the Red Line.

While it would be the ultimate glory for a magician, it might be a terrible thing for Gaold himself.

Olivia dredged up a distant memory.

There had been a day when the eyes of the world's power holders focused on Alpheas Magic School.

It was a matter that transcended the weight of human affairs, and Olivia had been one of the figures present at that occasion.

"I'm sorry about Miro's matter."

Alpheas fell silent. Adrias Miro. And Mikea Gaold. When he thought of his two disciples, his chest still ached.

Olivia suddenly recalled a memory and asked:

"What was it called? The Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society?"

Alpheas nodded bitterly. All the events that shook the world had started from there.

"Miro and Gaold, both were founding members. What troublemakers they were. At the time, they were real headaches. They only went around causing ridiculous incidents. But because they existed, this world exists now."

"Does it still exist? The research society, I mean."

Alpheas raised the corners of his mouth. Looking back now, it was truly an ironic connection.

"Shirone, Iruki, Nade. The protagonists of this duel and the world's greatest troublemakers are protecting it. They're Miro's direct juniors."

Olivia's eyes lit up as she looked at Shirone.

The Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society seems incompatible with the magic school that pursues intellect, but the deeper you think about it, the more you tremble at the enormity of its true intent.

If Miro had been at the center of the research society then, now Shirone was there. It might be mere coincidence, but she felt there was an unknown thread connecting things that couldn't be analyzed through causality—that he, the school's only Unlocker, had decided on Miro's research society.

The students' cheers grated on Dante's nerves. He wanted to get up immediately and beat down Shirone, but he needed at least 2 more seconds to recover from the Anti-Magic shock.

'This is maddening. I still can't stand up.'

Shirone's attack was a marvel that couldn't be explained even by the word violent. If he had been even slightly late in casting his defensive magic circle, the match might already have ended.

'But I endured it. That's all I need to think about.'

Danger is familiar to defensive-type magicians. For someone who can only win by withstanding the opponent's attacks, one knockdown isn't as serious an issue as it would be for magicians of other types.

But the shame carved into his heart was considerable.

No matter how not serious it was, this was the first time he had been knocked down so quickly while fighting anyone.

'2 seconds. 1 second. Done.'

Dante finally escaped from the shock and slowly rose. It was utterly unbelievable, but looking back, it might have been a natural result.

He hadn't been careless. But tension more frightening than carelessness had robbed him of quick judgment.

The time before anything happens is always the most frightening. Having felt Shirone's capabilities with his body, something as futile as falling like that would absolutely never happen again.

"I'll give you credit. Among everyone in the entire Kingdom, those who've pushed me this far can be counted on one hand. I'll put you roughly in the top 20."

Shirone said nothing. Dante's arrogant attitude of ranking fellow students didn't even register in his eyes.

It had been a full-power offensive with Immortal Function activated. Honestly, he had thought the duel was over. But he hadn't fallen. That fact made Shirone frustrated.

As Dante refined his Spirit Zone, he said:

"But from now on, it'll be different. You'd better prepare..."

"Dante."

Shirone cut him off as if he didn't need to hear any more.

He needed to raise it higher. He needed overwhelming power to ensure Dante could absolutely never get up.

"This is the last time I'll tell you before starting."

As Shirone transformed into a flash and approached, Dante felt his heart drop and hastily cast teleportation.

Having barely avoided Shirone's biting attack, he wiped his chest. Judging by the distance, they would have collided if he had retreated even slightly later.

Had he wanted mutual destruction? No, he had definitely been expecting this reaction.

Shirone still held the initiative in battle.

'But I'll turn it around here.'

As Dante, who had been repeatedly retreating, changed direction, Shirone's flash also sharply bent its angle to pursue.

Within the 10-meter radius of one teleportation, two streaks of light decorated the sky with tremendous movement.

The students opened their eyes wide in disbelief. It had been just a year ago that Shirone had taken his advancement exam by teleporting at the Uncrossable Bridge.

Of course, even then Shirone had the record of passing through the Dragon's Maze with 10-stage difficulty, but the techniques he was displaying now were all advanced techniques that professionals used.

Dante was also demonstrating techniques of the same level, but he was a specialist who had built up steady training at the Royal Magic School from childhood.

In short, Shirone's growth rate was too fast. They even wondered if his time flowed differently from others.

"Just when did he reach such a level...?"

The moment Mark muttered this, Shirone and Dante simultaneously charged toward each other.

The students' hearts stopped at the exact same moment.

Surely neither Shirone nor Dante had known the other would choose to charge. But neither of them thought to avoid it.

It was a game of chicken where both would lose their lives if one didn't give up.

Two flashes of light met on the horizon. Just as the students thought it was the end and squeezed their eyes shut, the two people bent at different angles with exactly the same timing from the center of the horizon.

Mark couldn't measure with his eyes who had avoided first. Even in the game of chicken, the two were neck and neck.

"Does this mean their magical sense is at the same level?"

Iruki was genuinely impressed. Although he had been knocked down once, Dante's movement was so impressive that the title of the Kingdom's best wasn't wasted.

Shirone and Dante were chasing each other's phantoms.

Their eyelids were fixed as if frozen, and their pupils were sucking in their entire field of vision.

Even while displaying concentration that transcended human limits, Shirone was amazed by Dante's defensive ability.

'His defensive sense is truly incredible. I can't bite into him at all.'

Dante's movement when he was determined to defend was at the level of art. If he advanced 10 meters, Dante would retreat 10 meters, and even when he changed it to 9.8 meters, he maintained exactly the same spacing while escaping.
