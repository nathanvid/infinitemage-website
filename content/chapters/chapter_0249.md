However, Shirone did not stop his teleportation.

No matter how precise the defense, it couldn't surpass the mechanism of stimulus-first, response-second.

'Now!'

The moment Shirone tilted his body in photonized state, Dante transformed into light and retreated.

Truly superhuman reflexes. But this time, that became his poison. Shirone withdrew his feint and stepped back.

'Oh no!'

By the time Dante realized Shirone's strategy, teleportation had already activated and he was moving away.

As the distance instantly widened to 20 meters, Shirone immediately fired Photon Cannon.

Before the approaching network of photons that devoured the space to dodge, Dante's movement was also useless. Choosing the ground as his only escape route, Dante spread defensive magic circles above his head upon landing.

Shirone gritted his teeth and cast magic continuously.

Immortal Function expands a magician's mind to infinity, but reality is not so forgiving. If the infinite lock is completely released, the ego would disintegrate.

Therefore, Unlockers draw infinite power through the hole called Spirit Zone. The Spirit Zone becomes a barrier that maintains the boundary between reality and infinity.

As a result, it could be called endless mental power, but if the Spirit Zone's durability isn't enough to withstand the weight of infinity, there's also the danger of being swept away in an instant.

However, Shirone remained unshaken despite consuming mental power beyond his available limit. This was thanks to reaching the mental state of diamond rigidity that transcended the realm of endurance.

'More! More! More!'

Based on enormous mental power, Photon Cannon poured down to the ground without rest.

"Graaah!"

Dante spread 10 defensive magic circles like a roof above his head and endured with all his might. Even so, he thought it didn't make sense. No matter what human it was, if they cast magic continuously, the power should gradually decrease. But Shirone's offensive wasn't weakeningâ€”it was getting even stronger.

'Damn it! What kind of attack power is this?'

He had never been this demoralized even against the kingdom's renowned hard punchers.

Dante suddenly realized. Immortal Function. The realm he had thought was merely a monk's mental game was pressing down on him miserably.

The bombardment continued for a full 2 minutes.

Dante couldn't move a single step from where he stood defending. Even his specialty evasion ability was helpless against attacks pouring down like hail.

Students glanced anxiously at their Advanced Practice Hall bracelets growing hot. The fact that the bracelets controlling the Advanced Practice Hall's information exchange were hot enough to feel on the skin was proof that the amount of information flowing between Shirone and Dante was rapidly soaring.

"We're not going to explode, are we?"

To Mark's frightened question, Amy said:

"Don't worry. There were no problems even in the graduating class. Even if the Advanced Practice Hall system overheats, safety devices will activate in the worst-case scenario."

Mark sighed with relief.

"I-I see."

Amy added one more thing.

"Of course, getting this hot isn't exactly common."

Shirone was starting to feel frustrated. Even though over 3 minutes had passed, Dante's defense hadn't been broken. But Dante's fierce resistance only fueled Shirone's fighting spirit more.

'Then...!'

Shirone stopped the continuous fire of Photon Cannon and cast Laser. A single red flash fell onto Dante's magic circle.

When the power was weaker than expected, Dante snorted as if it were nothing and began repairing his magic circle.

The dozen or so magic circles instantly returned to perfect condition.

However, shortly after, Dante's face subtly contorted and he felt energy even more powerful than Photon Cannon, unlike before.

"Wh-what is this...!"

The moment Dante uttered words filled with horror, Shirone amplified the laser with all his heart and soul.

The laser's thickness began to rapidly increase.

Finally, all the power drawn from the infinite realm was invested, and a massive red flash completely devoured the spot where Dante stood.

Students swallowed their saliva watching Dante's shadow that seemed to be burning in flames.

As the laser's thickness diminished and finally disappeared, Dante was revealed standing dazed with both arms covering his face. The defensive magic circles that had blocked Photon Cannon were nowhere to be seen.

Shirone landed opposite Dante. Slowly lowering his hands, Dante glared at Shirone and ground his teeth.

"Damn it..."

Dante's knees buckled as if breaking and struck the floor.

He had tried to endure somehow, but Photon Cannon's destructive power was irresistible. The shock of Anti-Magic striking his brain was incomparable to any magic he had received in the Advanced Practice Hall until now.

"This can't be... Dante knelt again."

The first down could be thought of as just Shirone's surprise attack working, but this time the down was taken by a clear difference in skill.

As such, the current result was shocking to the students.

Murmuring sounds could be heard from the faculty as well. Who would have known that Shirone, who had only been learning magic for one year, would down Dante, the kingdom's number one, twice?

Ethella said:

"His personality is sharp, but surprisingly his magic is heavy. Having no subtle techniques is a weakness, but he has destructive power that surpasses that."

You can tell a magician's inclination by looking at the magic they use. This was especially true for Unlockers, most of whose magic manifested through their unique insight.

At Ethella's praise, Thad smacked his lips.

Since Shirone monopolized the love of many female students, he wasn't personally close to him, but he acknowledged his skill.

"Well, he's serious about everything."

With Dante's down, the students' enthusiasm grew even hotter.

Everyone chanted Shirone's name, and that sound returned as an echo, elevating the atmosphere once again.

Nade blinked and said:

"Was Shirone's magic... originally that tough?"

Iruki had the same thought.

"He might have been confident, or he might have aimed for psychological effects too. It's a changed aspect compared to last semester. It seems there was a change of heart."

Amy, who had been resting her chin on her hand, smirked.

"Well... he did go through some rough things."

Shirone had fought bloody battles with the Parrot Mercenary Corps on Galiant Island. In Heaven, he had faced countless powerful enemies who transcended humanity.

It would be strange if he were the same as last semester.

"My goodness... Dante... How could this happen..."

Reporter Killine was shocked by the current result. Apart from his undefeated record, there had never been a student in all previous matches who had unilaterally brought Dante to his knees.

'Shirone, was it? Why hasn't such a child appeared in magazines until now?'

According to her investigation, Shirone had only been attending magic school for one year. If that was true, he wouldn't have had time to distinguish himself, let alone be featured.

When Killine first heard that story, she didn't believe it. No, even if it were true, she thought he was just an overhyped student from some mediocre provincial school level.

But he was completely overwhelming Dante. He was literally a rookie who appeared like a comet.

Dante slowly got up. Unlike the first down, no emotion showed on his face.

"Second down. This is also a first."

Dante spoke and shook his head. Counting the number was meaningless anymore.

Because the human called Shirone himself was a first.

Originally, attack-focused magicians were the type he could most easily handle and also liked. But with an opponent possessing such tremendous punching power, it had the opposite effect.

A bitter smile formed on Dante's lips. He never thought he would use this magic circle before even entering the graduating class.

He had never cast it in official matches, and even including unofficial ones, it was only twice.

Only Closer and Sabina knew that those two opponents had been an active 9th-grade magician and 70 members of a B-rank bandit group.

"Sorry. It seems I underestimated you too much."

At that moment, a massive magic circle emitting red light was inscribed with Dante at the center. The clarity was incomparable to instant magic circles, and the size was more than 10 times larger.

Siena confirmed that Dante's mental power gauge suddenly decreased by more than half.

His vast mental power that had shown no signs of diminishing despite fighting until now. She couldn't readily predict what kind of magic circle would use half of that.

"Central computation magic circle Pascal."

As Dante muttered, the massive magic circle blazed red and simultaneously generated nearly 100 magic circles.

Shirone was shocked seeing the magic circles each preparing different magic. It felt like facing 100 magicians.

"Immortal Function. I looked down on it, but it's certainly impressive. That would be an Unlocker's insight?"

Shirone had no leisure to answer. Whatever magic it was, it was on a different dimension from instant magic circles. If he didn't analyze it as quickly as possible, he would lose his winning opportunity.

"This time I'll show you what I have."

The moment Dante extended his hand, all kinds of magic poured out from the hundred or so magic circles.

Wind Cutter and Fireball, Lightning Bolt and Ice Spear, even photon output without physical force.

Shirone was mesmerized by the scene unfolding before his eyes.

The most shocking thing was that over 10 types of magic were being cast simultaneously.

Even Iruki, a Servant ability user, could only cast two types of magic with Double Spirit Zone, so it was natural to feel like he was dreaming.

Nade bit his thumbnail and said:

"Probably... parallel circuits."

Mark turned his head with a surprised expression.

"What? Parallel circuits? Those magic circles?"

"Magic requires high concentration. To cast one magic, you can't think of anything else even slightly. But each of Dante's magic circles has independent circuits."

"Is that possible? Unless you have multiple brains, you can only make one magic circle per insight. Even if it's passive, making them according to time sequence is standard."

Nade pointed to Dante's Pascal.

"That's exactly it. Dante created another brain. That central magic circle is definitely converging Dante's insight and distributing it in parallel."

Nade's prediction was accurate. Pascal was a magic circle that stored the insight flowing in a magician's head in memory and then processed it through parallel computation.

Dante with Pascal activated was never defensive. Rather, he crushes opponents with extreme firepower.

As if proving that fact, all the basic magic that could be learned at school was pouring out.

Shirone didn't stop his offensive. Creating virtual memory to unfold serial thoughts in parallel was certainly an amazing feat.

But strictly speaking, there was no advantage between serial and parallel. If it was parallel circuits, individual power inevitably had to decrease.

The fact that all magic cast from Dante's magic circles were basic magic was evidence.

'There's no time. I have to end it now.'

The time he could maintain the infinite realm was running short. Now was the only time he could overwhelm Dante with force.

Shirone fired Photon Cannon with all his might. However, the moment it passed through a certain section, it suddenly began to slow down.

As the near-light-speed photons showed speed reduction comparable to snails, Shirone examined the front. And he realized.

The hundreds of magic circles Dante had deployed were forming small groups and exerting influence on specific spaces.

If you connected the magic circles forming groups with virtual surfaces, they formed cube-like cubic faces while activating specific magic inside them.

Nade shouted with an absurd expression:

"Three-dimensional mansion? A student is using that?"

Dante had assembled two-dimensional flat magic circles into three-dimensional structures.

Shirone's Photon Cannon had also slowed down by entering the mansion simultaneously designated by six Slow magic circles positioned 5 meters apart.

When considering how many circuits could be integrated into a limited space determines functionality, three-dimensional mansions could demonstrate tremendous efficiency that surpassed the limitations of planes.
