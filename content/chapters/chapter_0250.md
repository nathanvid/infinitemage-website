Shirone finally stopped his offensive. While parallel circuits alone had reduced power, if they were gathered to form mansions, they could produce incomparably powerful amplification even compared to series circuits.

Moreover, due to the nature of three-dimensional circuits, the distribution patterns looked different depending on the observation point. Therefore, it was impossible to determine what the six magic circles forming a specific mansion were.

It was like the difference between drawing dots on paper and connecting them to make a square—which was immediately visible—versus drawing them three-dimensionally where nothing could be distinguished.

"How about it, Shirone? Can you avoid this too?"

The moment Dante finished speaking, six air-element magic circles moved and trapped Shirone in a Pressure Mansion.

"Kugh!"

The moment Shirone felt the weight pressing on his spine, a bluish volt charged in the center of the Electric Mansion floating above Dante's head.

When the powerful electric beam fired, the air where the electricity passed was completely burned with the stinging noise of colliding charges.

No matter where Shirone tried to dodge, the attacks followed him. This was because the photon output from the Photon Mansion was tracking Shirone's coordinates in real time.

"Ah..."

Shirone felt his mind grow distant. He didn't feel like he was fighting a person. It felt like fighting an armed warship equipped with countless weapons.

Shirone rolled on the ground to avoid ice spears falling vertically. As the world spun around him, he heard burning sounds near the ground. He cast photonization magic and sprang his waist just as an Atomic Bomb exploded almost simultaneously.

The students were stunned by Dante's overwhelming firepower.

"My god... what kind of magic is that?"

Mark also thought it was impossible. Even if Pascal performed parallel processing, it was still the human brain that controlled everything. Managing hundreds of magic circles was beyond human capability.

Iruki looked back at Nade. Seeing his unusually serious expression, it seemed he had already figured it out.

"Nade, say something. I honestly don't understand."

"That's... an automaton."

"Automaton?"

"An automated mechanical device. You mesh multiple gears together and then move the first gear. Then the last gear produces a fixed value. It's a simple mechanism, but when this process extends to astronomical units, things that seem very difficult become possible. Things like photon output tracking Shirone's coordinates or rapidly switching mansions."

Shirone was experiencing the power of the automaton firsthand. No matter how he responded, the automaton that automatically calculated and countered was an impregnable fortress.

Though they were basic spells, their power enhanced by mansions was by no means basic. Shirone, who had rolled on the ground avoiding bombardment, frantically searched for Dante but couldn't even see him buried among hundreds of magic circles.

The magic circles floating in all directions felt like the gaze of a monster with hundreds of eyes.

"Uuuugh!"

Feeling a creepy sensation, Shirone madly fired Photon Cannons. The automaton reacted immediately. A fully charged Lightning Cannon from the Volt Mansion fired, creating a blinding flash of electricity that carved a straight line through space and burst the Photon Cannon like a balloon.

When the Lightning Cannon grazed Shirone's side, that alone triggered Anti-Magic. While Shirone staggered, the automaton unleashed every available spell. Countless spells beyond counting devastated the entire radius.

Pascal, having consumed all available energy, made bizarre sounds and stopped functioning. As the smoke cleared, Shirone appeared clutching one shoulder. A moment later, his knees buckled and finally struck the ground.

"Th-this time Shirone has fallen."

One knockdown wasn't the problem. The fact that Anti-Magic had hit directly meant Shirone's durability had cracked, and that meant the end of his Immortal Function.

"Truly magnificent."

Even Alpheas had to admire it this time. Pascal with parallel magic circles and three-dimensional mansions enhancing power. The Dante System, equipped with automation through automatons, was comparable to an artwork that had reached the pinnacle of functionality.

To think of combining automatons with information magic. It was a challenge that no professional magician could easily accomplish. No, it was impossible at the student level, no matter how talented Dante was.

If it were possible, it would only be under one assumption.

"Is he using binary?"

Olivia remained silent. But that was enough for Alpheas to realize. He was definitely using binary. In his mind rose the only race that could use a magic system composed of 1s and 0s.

"Since when... has Dante learned the dragon language?"

A smile formed on Olivia's lips. If he was already certain, there was no need to hide it anymore.

"What's wrong with that? Dragon language magic is a binary system, but it's not exclusively for dragons."

"Humans can understand binary. But using binary at the level of language is an entirely different matter."

Alpheas suddenly realized.

"Don't tell me... he was born with it?"

"I couldn't believe it at first either. But it's true. Like Shirone's insight or Iruki's savant syndrome, Dante was born with information processing ability."

Olivia recalled meeting Dante ten years ago.

When she was serving as principal of the Royal Magic School, an invitation to teatime arrived from a social gathering in Bashka.

The host was Bianca, the lady of the Airhine family. Six people gathered in total, and except for Olivia, all were married women.

The ladies savored tea from overseas while chatting.

Olivia also exchanged conversation on topics that interested her, but the married women's chatter inevitably turned to talk about their children.

Bianca sighed and said:

"It's really troubling. Our youngest son submitted a leave of absence and came home this time."

"Oh my, but Dante is known as an exemplary student. Did something happen at school?"

Bianca shook her head with a dark expression.

"I don't know. He won't talk at all these days. He came home with bruises on his face, saying he fought with friends at school. From what I heard, it seems several people beat him up."

The ladies' faces flushed. The thought of their own children being treated that way made them tremble with anger and their hands shake.

"What? You just let that slide? You should have gone to the school immediately and filed a complaint."

"I tried to do that too. But I heard something shocking at the school. They said Dante hadn't spoken a single word to his friends. Even when they talked to him, he wouldn't even look at them. The homeroom teacher initially thought he had become mute."

"Oh dear... Isn't there some reason?"

"No matter how much I ask, he won't talk. Anyway, I went to confront them but felt like the sky was falling, so I just brought Dante back."

Olivia paused while tilting her teacup. Since she had no children, they wouldn't include her anyway, so she had stayed quiet, but one possibility came to mind.

Bianca rested her chin on her hand and continued:

"Sigh, so in the end I made him quit school and kept him at home. But what worries me is that he sits in the garden all day just staring at the ground. When I ask him why, he absolutely won't answer. I can only watch helplessly."

The woman sitting next to her took Bianca's hand and said:

"Don't worry too much. Dante is only ten years old. It's an age when he'll have many thoughts. Noble children hit puberty much earlier than commoners."

"I hope that's all it is..."

Bianca had no way to console her troubled heart.

Dante had been a bright child since young, receiving all the family's expectations. To think such a precious child would cause such worry.

The ladies offered words of comfort to Bianca. Though not all the words were sincere, being mothers themselves, they could fully understand her distress.

Olivia muttered as she set down her teacup:

"Overflow..."

Bianca looked back at Olivia.

"Pardon? What did you just say?"

Olivia hurriedly collected herself. Being a teacher, she knew how dangerous it was to evaluate a child in front of their parents.

But with everyone's attention focused on her, it was difficult to take back her words. Especially in front of ladies who couldn't stand not hearing about anything curious.

Olivia spoke with a tone suggesting it was nothing serious:

"Ah, it seems like it might be overflow."

"Overflow? What's that?"

"Well, it's not common, but it's a phenomenon that occurs when someone awakens at a young age. Actually, it's more of a psychological factor than a phenomenon. When existing common sense collapses, they see a world different from the original world. Usually they suffer from extreme fear."

"Then you're saying our son has gotten sick?"

Cold sweat ran down Olivia's spine. If she answered wrong here, not only would she be branded in high society, but she would suffer from gossip for a long time.

"No. It's not a disease. It commonly appears in geniuses, so to speak. There are quite a few such children in magic schools too."

Olivia had no choice but to use the magic word that any parent couldn't help but be attracted to.

As expected, Bianca exchanged glances with the other ladies as if asking whether they had heard correctly.

Was there any event that could excite parents more than their child being a genius?

Thanks to this, Olivia avoided humiliation, but she had to pay the price dearly.

Setting aside the other ladies, Bianca turned to Olivia as if for a private conversation and asked about everything.

Whether Dante was really a genius, what field he was a genius in if so, how to educate him in such cases, and so on.

Olivia gave various answers, but nothing was certain.

If it could be determined so easily, the geniuses who had suffered from overflow wouldn't have spent their later years in misfortune.

"Really, really, you're saying our Dante is a genius? Hmm... it does seem like that. He's had extraordinary aspects since he was young. Come to think of it, genius children are easily ostracized from groups. That's why Dante didn't get along with his friends."

Olivia wanted to go home. She couldn't bring herself to say it was just a possibility to Bianca's face.

Before she could find an excuse to escape, Bianca struck first.

"Could you... possibly interview Dante?"

"Pardon? Right now?"

This time even Olivia openly showed reluctance. She didn't want to play teacher even at a social gathering.

If she interviewed him and he turned out to be nothing special, how would she handle the aftermath?

Bianca, nicknamed the fox of high society, couldn't have been unaware of Olivia's feelings.

She stood up from her seat with determination and pleaded once more.

With other ladies present, this was the utmost courtesy she could show.

"Please, I beg you. Ms. Olivia, you're the principal of the Royal Magic School. You'll surely be able to discover Dante's hidden talents. Dante is in the annex garden right now."

With the situation having reached this point, Olivia had no choice but to agree. She finally sighed and stood up. But she didn't forget to take out insurance for potential problems.

"Alright. I'll try the interview. But don't think hastily. If it really is overflow, it's a matter that requires long-term teaching."

"Yes, yes, please take care of it."

Olivia headed to the annex to interview a student she had never seen.

Befitting a family ranked 20th in Tormia's financial hierarchy, the annex was as large as any noble's mansion.

Grass full of spring fragrance spread as wide as a playground, and beyond it lay a deep forest.

Dante was sitting at the entrance to the forest. Olivia looked at the child from a distance and sighed again.

Perhaps, as the lady said, puberty had come early. But she was certain it was overflow. It was intuition gained from 20 years of teaching.
