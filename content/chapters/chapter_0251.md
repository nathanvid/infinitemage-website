Actually, overflow wasn't such a big deal.

To ordinary people's eyes, it might look like a genius's eccentricity, but if you went to the Royal Magic School, the place was crawling with such children.

Among them, you had to stand out, then climb through fierce competition again to finally earn the title of genius—that was the world of talent.

In any case, since she had been given the job, she couldn't do it carelessly. Olivia wore the smile that had captivated countless students and walked toward Dante.

"Hello? You're Dante, right?"

Dante didn't answer, didn't even lift his head. Olivia looked down at his gray hair that resembled storm clouds. Thinking this wouldn't be easy, she sat down facing Dante, matching his eye level.

The child was still staring only at the grass-covered ground.

'What is he looking at?'

Olivia also lowered her head following Dante's gaze.

It was ordinary grass that didn't seem to have treasure buried beneath it, nor corpses interred.

With patience and persistent observation, a minor presence hidden in the landscape was revealed.

It was a procession of ants.

'Is he interested in insects?'

Olivia asked Dante.

"Do you like ants?"

"......"

As expected, no answer came. But Olivia didn't press him.

Having raised students from as young as four to over thirty years old, she knew how to handle such situations.

"I hate ants. They're disgusting. When they get into the house, they even gnaw at expensive furniture."

Olivia rattled off meaningless chatter.

"When I was young, I saw ants swarming all over a dead earthworm. Ugh. Since then, I've been afraid of ants. You know how it is—ants crawling all over your body..."

"They're not ants."

Dante spoke for the first time.

Olivia smiled triumphantly.

She didn't know what kind of awakening had brought on the overflow, but he was still a child. Having spoken first, he wouldn't be able to resist confessing.

"I'm watching channels."

"Channels?"

Dante pointed to one of the ants moving between the bushes.

"This ant is called 1011001. That's the name I gave it. This ant's movement radius is 4 meters. It's a patrol soldier that circles the perimeter to check the territory."

Olivia examined it carefully.

Despite being given the name 1011001, she couldn't find any particularly distinguishing features from other ants.

Dante pointed to an ant climbing over bent grass.

"This ant is 1010111. It makes vertical movements. Its role is to climb grass and collect moisture. This 1010101 is the same, and so is 1101001."

Olivia was perplexed. She couldn't tell if he was really memorizing the ants' names or just making them up on the spot to tease adults.

"Ants perform a single purpose. When such ants gather together, they activate the whole. This is what channels are."

If Dante could read channels—if he was reading flows rather than seeing forms—then distinguishing ants' names might have some possibility.

But was such a thing really possible?

Strictly speaking, everything in the world is channels.

If ant society could be decomposed into information units, there would be nothing in the world that couldn't be analyzed.

As her eyes adapted to nature, Olivia's vision filled with swarming ants.

Now she could see that a 4-meter radius was an ant field.

Though she felt goosebumps, her curiosity about Dante was now greater than her disgust.

"So you're saying you can read channels?"

Dante lifted his head. Olivia could see Dante's face for the first time.

He was a pretty child. One eye was badly bruised, as if he'd been beaten by friends.

"It must have hurt a lot."

"It's okay. I don't have to go to school anymore."

Most teachers would normally comfort the child and send him back to school. Even without mentioning hollow social skills, telling him not to run away but to face things head-on would be society's common sense.

But Olivia didn't try to persuade Dante. This child was special. Her Great Magician's intuition told her so.

"Why don't you get along with your friends? They said you didn't say a single word."

"If nothing can be transmitted, it's the same as not speaking. I didn't do it because there was no reason to."

Dante made a disgusted expression recalling that time.

"Friends talk a lot. But it's just noise. Ants are different. They have a single purpose. Even ants that seem purposeless support other purposes through that."

Olivia was finally certain of the overflow.

When you dig deeply into anything, a world completely different from common sense opens up.

Dante had entered that world too early.

"This ant is 1010110, and it just follows 1010111. But it's very important work. Because it's a channel. If no one followed 1010111, nothing would be transmitted. Look carefully—most ants exist only to maintain channels. The ants that do truly special work are very few. Can you distinguish them?"

Olivia smiled awkwardly and shook her head.

No matter how excellent a magician she was, she couldn't distinguish the roles of every member of the ant kingdom.

"If you watch all day, you realize an interesting fact. All channels are connected. For example, this ant number 1111 just follows the ant in front to maintain the channel. But amazingly, it's involved in almost every channel. If this ant weren't here..."

Dante lowered his index finger and crushed ant 1111. Olivia frowned. But moments later, she intuited changes in ant society and her eyes widened.

The ant procession collapsed and scattered in different directions. Lines spreading into surfaces meant channels becoming meaningless.

The boy watched the ant kingdom collapse with sparkling eyes, wearing an eerily pure smile.

Olivia felt a shudder. The ant Dante had crushed wasn't a soldier ant, nor was it particularly special.

Eliminating one ant shouldn't cause a system to collapse.

No, she had thought so until now. But Dante's action showed her that her common sense was wrong.

The blind spot of an invisible system.

All the variables arising from eliminating ant 1111 were being calculated in Dante's mind.

Dante clearly understood the ant kingdom's system perfectly—better than even the ants themselves.

Dante looked up at Olivia and smiled.

"The queen will starve to death."

**Another Sky (1)**

Olivia gazed at Dante, who had grown over eight years, with a pleased smile.

"Dante has eyes that can read channels. And he's strengthened them further through training."

Shirone, with Immortal Function's door closed, was too busy dodging bombardment to think of anything else. With 86 mansions constantly changing their structures, he had no time for other thoughts.

In contrast, Dante, who had left combat to his automatons, was relaxed. He could probably sit there reading a book.

'But I should pay back what I received.'

Dante floated above the Pascal magic circle. As he slowly advanced in that state, hundreds of magic circles connected to Pascal surged toward Shirone at the same speed.

It was as if a massive space was moving in its entirety.

Every time Shirone moved, magic poured out in all directions as the gun barrels rotated.

Shirone felt like he was fighting an army. A massive force was cutting through his Spirit Zone and attacking.

Iruki's face twisted frighteningly.

'Damn! How can he use such magic...'

No method came to mind for countering Dante's system. Though he hadn't taken fatal damage yet, he couldn't dodge the automated machinery forever.

Shirone knew this fact too. But he had no choice. Moreover, it wasn't as completely impossible as Iruki thought.

'I have to try.'

Shirone assumed one possibility and dove into Pascal's center. Dante's mansions moved rapidly, increasing firepower, but the faster they did so, the more quickly he chained teleportations.

He had to move.

He had to synchronize with Dante's channel.

As time passed, students began to stir. Though imperceptibly subtle to the eye, they felt that Shirone's movements were gradually meshing with Dante's system.

Nade jumped up and shouted.

"Teleportation! There was such a method!"

Iruki also raised the corners of his mouth as if he'd been struck.

"Teleportation is information itself. It's a strategy to mix into Dante's system and collapse it from within."

The Advanced Practice Hall's bracelet grew hotter. It was proof that Pascal, tracking Shirone's movements, was overloading.

Siena confirmed that as Shirone's movements became more complex, Dante's mental power gauge rapidly decreased.

'The match isn't decided yet?'

Alpheas exhaled roughly. He was feeling a light thrill running down his spine.

'Dante's ability is formidable. But insight is also a terrifying talent that can reach the top of the world.'

In a short time, Shirone had perfectly grasped Pascal's weakness. Dante's automatons were perfect, but that was precisely why the modifier "perfect" couldn't be applied to humans.

The only error in flawless Pascal.

That was Dante himself.

"I'd like to praise Dante for his perfect design. But he's still young. His mental power can't keep up with his technique."

Olivia had to acknowledge it. She hadn't been unaware of Dante's weakness. No, could this even be called a weakness?

Being young wasn't a sin.

Dante would grow further and surely reach a level where he could maintain Pascal for long periods.

But such facts couldn't serve as excuses. Those facing Dante were in the same position.

Above all, Dante's endurance was by no means inferior compared to his peers.

The only thing Dante had miscalculated in this match was that his opponent was Shirone, whose endurance was unmatched.

'Perhaps... they met too early.'

It was regrettable that one of them—Shirone or Dante—had to bear the burden of defeat.

'No, it's the same for everyone. There's no such thing as the right time.'

The match had already begun, and time couldn't be reversed. Moreover, analyzing coldly, Dante's odds of winning were still over 70%.

Though Pascal could only be maintained for about 10 more minutes, it would be difficult for Shirone to last more than 5 minutes within Dante's system.

Olivia said.

"Even so, he won't be able to defeat Dante. I'm not disparaging Shirone, but the rarity of talent is different. Shirone doesn't have the means to destroy Dante's system."

Alpheas couldn't argue. Even to his eyes, Shirone had no advantages yet.

But even so, the child made him hopeful.

'There must be something I don't know, right, Shirone?'

Shirone flew throughout the Advanced Practice Hall. In the process of avoiding Dante's barrage, he was hit by countless spells, but each time he paid the price of failure, he immediately sought change.

Iruki was the first to realize and speak.

"Got it. He's perfectly entered."

At first, no one understood. But after 10 seconds, students began murmuring in surprise.

In a battlefield where infinite firepower rained down, Shirone was moving about freely. It was as if the mansions made way for him whenever he moved.

Of course, since there was no connection between Shirone and Pascal's movements, it was just an optical illusion. Nevertheless, this phenomenon occurred in only one case.

"Shirone is perfectly reading the automatons' patterns."
