Mark looked back and forth between Shirone and Iruki, making a fuss.

"Shirone-senpai has the advantage, right? Right?"

"It's an even situation. If time continues like this, Pascal will be overloaded. If it can get to that point, the match will be back to square one. Dante will have lost his strongest weapon too."

Mark was so happy he could cry.

Just moments ago, he had thought Shirone's defeat was a foregone conclusion. He had even been thinking that it was impressive just to fight on equal terms with Dante, the kingdom's top prospect.

But Shirone had spectacularly reversed the tide of battle.

"As expected of Shirone-senpai. Does this mean he surpassed Dante-senpai in information processing ability too?"

Iruki didn't answer.

When Mark turned his head with a puzzled expression, he saw all the upperclassmen sitting in a row watching the duel with serious eyes.

Iruki kept scratching his chin.

It was true that Shirone had seen through Dante's system, but he couldn't understand how that was possible.

If Dante's automaton was something that could be analyzed so easily, Shirone wouldn't have struggled from the beginning.

Amy gave up thinking and asked.

"How did he analyze the pattern? Honestly, I don't even know how Dante's automaton functions. I can't even get a feel for it. Nade, what about you?"

"Same here. It's not that it's complex, but the system is too big. You can't imagine the shape of an elephant just by looking at its leg."

Amy thought Nade's analogy was perfect.

"Exactly. It's not a system made just to face Shirone. The range of variation depending on the opponent is enormous, so how can Shirone read the whole thing?"

Iruki presented one hypothesis.

"It might not be mathematical."

Mark tilted his head.

"Not mathematical? Then what is it?"

Iruki frowned as he chose appropriate words.

"Intuition... should I call it?"

"Intuition? You mean like a gut feeling?"

Mark was dumbfounded. Dante's system was the pinnacle of cutting-edge information magic. If such a system could be understood through intuition, what would be the point of living life the hard way?

But Iruki was serious. No matter how much he thought about it, that was closest to the right answer, and it wasn't something that could be done easily as Mark thought.

"Intuition isn't something like superstition. Rather, it's the evolved form of inductive logical systems."

To prove that humans have two eyes, you don't need to count how many eyes everyone in the world has.

Most people are confident that humans have two eyes because their family members and friends don't have three eyes.

Amy said.

"Shirone's insight is transcendent. He understands the whole with just a small amount of data. But even that has limits. A certain amount of information needs to be collected for it to be possible."

Iruki said.

"But there are exceptions. I mean the quality of data. You can't imagine an elephant by looking at just its leg, but if you gathered an elephant's skeleton, you could predict its general shape."

Nade also thought Iruki was right.

"Probably special information that could only be confirmed by risking one's life to infiltrate Dante's system was collected by Shirone. He analyzed the entire system based on that information."

Mark recalled what Principal Alpheas always said. Insight is faster than effort and more accurate than knowledge. If Dante had the ability to read channels, then Shirone had the insight to penetrate all things.

Every time Shirone moved, the Advanced Practice Hall bracelet was heating up. Even though there were safety measures, if he kept wearing it, he would probably get first-degree burns.

Dante was shocked to see Shirone surviving inside the Pascal system for over five minutes.

It was an automaton that would crush any opponent with firepower within five seconds once it bit down.

It was the heart of hell implemented as a system.

A normal human should be paralyzed with fear, yet he was moving around as if it were his own backyard playground.

'Why? Why isn't he shaken?'

Since insight is the ultimate form of inductive logical systems, it doesn't provide 100 percent accurate answers. That's why there's an even greater likelihood of anxiety about an uncertain future.

But Shirone didn't lose his composure. It was the Diamond Body's mental strength that maintained its form unchanged in any situation.

When Pascal became overloaded, Dante felt a sharp pain in his nose bridge. If he continued to endure like this, he would self-destruct along with the magic circle.

But he didn't stop.

Below the cliff, his first defeat in life was waiting. The blade in his heart had become as sharp as the accumulating victories, and that blade would cut him down with a single defeat.

'I absolutely cannot lose!'

Dante actually increased Pascal's calculation speed.

As he stepped into an unknown world he had never experienced before, another wall crumbled and an amazing world unfolded.

The light of the Pascal magic circle blazed intensely and the mansion's speed increased even more.

Long sequences of binary numbers flowed through his mind like rapids, scraping away at his brain.

The change in Pascal was immediately caught by the students' eyes. Functions that had been at least two beats slower than Shirone were now catching up to Shirone's speed.

Dante was confident.

'I can do it! I can still do more!'

Pascal didn't need to process everything in parallel. If he focused intensively on the most important calculations, localized functions could be improved several times over.

'Slow mansion first. Then fire, volt, press in that order.'

Dante prioritized specific addresses among the omniscience listed in Pascal's memory. It was like jumping from the 352nd calculation to the 2,987th calculation. Finally, when he reached the stage of going from end to end in one leap, a roar erupted from the Pascal magic circle.

'This is it! This is exactly what I wanted!'

Dante felt the freedom of his consciousness flying away.

He could no longer see Shirone, nor could he hear the sound of artillery fire echoing on the battlefield. Only the infinite array of 1s and 0s passing at electrical speed filled his mind.

Olivia trembled with emotion.

'Dante...'

She knew he would jump over the wall someday. She didn't know the catalyst would be Alpheas's disciple, but it didn't matter.

Dante, who had reached the realm of local calculation, had achieved growth as amazing as a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly.

"Ouch."

Dante lifted the finger that had been crushing the ant. The ant that had been biting his index finger struggled and fell to the ground.

Olivia glanced at the ant that had fallen to the floor and asked.

"Oh my. It bit you, I see. Does it hurt much?"

"Haha! It's fine. It happens all the time."

Dante put his finger in his mouth and sucked on it while observing the ant. Ant number 1111, having lost its purpose, seemed to realize the collapse of the kingdom and was spinning in circles, not knowing what to do.

"All channels are connected. If a specific channel is cut off, everything collapses. But..."

Dante gently picked up the confused ant and examined the chaotic political situation of the kingdom. After observing carefully, when he placed 1111 somewhere, stability began to gradually return centered around that spot.

Dante didn't stop there and placed several ants at key points. The sight of the kingdom, which had been on the verge of destruction, rapidly being built into a solid system presented Olivia with a sense of wonder.

"Hehe! Sorry, ants."

Dante looked up at Olivia and smiled brightly.

"It's okay now."

Olivia smiled as she looked at Dante. She stared into the boy's clear, transparent eyes as if trying to dig something out, and finally made her decision.

"Dante, would you like to learn magic?"

It was the day when the relationship between Olivia and Dante began.

Since that day, Olivia had never once doubted that Dante would become the kingdom's greatest mage.

He wasn't simply a machine that processed information. He was undeniably human who could break through any limit.

Shirone was certainly an amazing child, but there would be no one of the same level who could defeat Dante after he had jumped over the wall.

"Krrrrr...!"

Dante maintained his sanity with all his might. His information processing speed was accelerating to a degree he had never experienced in his life.

The magic spewing from 86 mansions now spread in all directions to the point where direction itself was meaningless.

If Shirone's judgment went even slightly wrong, the match would be over, and now even the students couldn't guarantee who would win.

Dante's mental strength was rapidly depleting, but Shirone was also linking over 2,000 teleportations.

'Damn it! Why? Why can't I hit him?'

Dante was flabbergasted.

Even though he had raised Pascal's functions to their maximum capacity, Shirone was still moving around inside the system. His thoughts were clearly accelerating to match the gear he had raised.

Dante's five senses were completely open, and he couldn't distinguish what was visual information and what was auditory information.

It was an amazing experience.

As Shirone's information mixed together, he felt a sense of unity as if body and mind had merged into one.

'Damn it! I'd rather not have this kind of thing with a guy!'

Whatever his emotions, Dante tasted supreme exhilaration. His thought reaction speed reached a realm he had never achieved before, and all of Shirone's information was decomposed into signals and rushed in.

The two engaged in a dialogue of existence. Raw communion without lies or truth. At that point, Shirone and Dante thrilled. As if they had become electricity itself, flashes exploded throughout their vision.

The dialogue between the ultimate talents of induction and deduction, borrowing the form of magic, was conveyed to everyone watching. The students watched the battle between the two without even blinking.

Battle is collision. But now the two seemed to be dancing. It was a dance woven with all kinds of magic and knowledge.

Alpheas smiled.

"To know what is right, one must take a long detour. Only when you believe, deny, and believe again does the spirit dwell in the body. It's fine to suffer all you want. After all, isn't it a different sky?"

Olivia's eyes settled calmly.

The Advanced Practice Hall battle simulation system was a place of opportunity for students to experience real combat in advance and a space for showing off superiority.

But would Jacobin, the developer of the Advanced Practice Hall, think the same?

Perhaps he had given students the freedom to fail to their heart's content.

Olivia clenched both fists placed on her knees.

Alpheas's philosophy was certainly right too. But having come this far, she didn't want to compromise. Once battle was joined, only the victor would be recorded in history. The winner had to be Dante. The disciple she was most proud of in her teaching career.

The information exchange between Shirone and Dante reached extreme levels, and students spun their increasingly hot bracelets around and around.

86 mansions and one streak of flash.

Watching the hundreds of information exchanges per second created by that combination made one feel dizzy.

Maria's eyes moistened. Talent that transcended the human realm. When two people possessing such talent became entangled, this absurd spectacle would unfold.

"Dante-senpai... is truly amazing."

Mark turned his head with a surprised expression. He had naturally expected Maria to cheer for Shirone. Even setting aside personal feelings, she could never forget the incident of being humiliated by Dante's group.

"Maria, what are you saying right now?"

"Today's duel will probably be recorded in history."

Mark realized something and closed his mouth. As Maria said, the duel between Shirone and Dante was exceeding the level of practice.

"I used to hate competition so much."

Mark knew too. Unable to overcome the pressure of competition, hadn't she even activated the mechanism of the Unbridgeable Bridge?

"But now... I think it's a truly wonderful world. Shirone-senpai was just a genius, wasn't he? You just had to look up to him without thinking. But Dante-senpai is making that Shirone-senpai fight with all his might."

Mark looked back at Maria with a pitying heart. Her feelings seeped in, melting his heartstrings with every word.

He felt the same way. But he couldn't think that way. If he thought that far, he would never be able to stand up again.

Maria lowered her head with a sad expression.

"I probably... will never experience something like that in my lifetime."

Mark gritted his teeth. Shirone's appearance matched perfectly with his ideal of a mage as if cast from the same mold.

What would it feel like? To show off one's skills in the heavenly realm. The feeling of grasping the best opponent and falling to the very end of hell.

He couldn't even imagine it, but it would be the greatest ecstasy a mage could feel.
