Tears welled up in Mark's eyes as well. But he never let them fall in the end.

"We can do it too."

Maria turned to look at Mark with slight surprise.

"We'll work hard and work harder. So we'll definitely challenge our senior. We might not be able to win, but we'll do our best to make him take us seriously. So don't talk weak. If you say something like that one more time, I won't hang around with you anymore."

"Mark..."

Iruki smiled wryly as he spoke.

"There's no such thing as talent in this world."

Mark and Maria turned their heads simultaneously.

"To be precise, there's no talent that can be named. A mentally ill person can't be good at math. But they could become the greatest painter. Magic is a profession that encompasses all fields. Shirone's insight or Dante's information processing ability - those don't guarantee the future. There's no need to envy what others have. If you can bring your own abilities to their peak, you might be able to defeat Shirone someday too."

"W-we never thought such a thing..."

Mark waved his hands frantically with a reddened face. Defeating Shirone - it was something he'd never even dreamed of.

But hearing these words from a genius acknowledged by the world, confidence began to well up in him again.

It was the first time Iruki truly felt like a senior to him.

Dante frowned at the flood of information. Sequences of 0s and 1s flashed through his mind at the speed of light. It was Shirone's information added to Pascal's data.

'I can do it! I'm catching up!'

Dante began to gain the upper hand in the speed battle. It was the difference between a living being and a machine. A living being's endurance slowly decreases, but an automaton only performs its original function until just before self-destruction.

The students watched as Pascal's attack magic gradually cornered Shirone. The radius of Shirone's teleportation was shrinking, and in 10 seconds it seemed he would fall into the Movement Zero zone.

Even so, Siena dared not predict the outcome of the match.

Certainly Shirone's movement was being restricted, but Dante's mental strength was also nearly at rock bottom.

'Can Dante hold out?'

Siena scrutinized the speed at which the gauge was decreasing.

'He can hold out. At this rate, it'll be Dante's victory.'

Though Siena also somewhat hoped for Shirone's victory, Dante certainly deserved to win. Especially the automaton's response capability had power that would work sufficiently even among professionals.

5 seconds. 4 seconds.

The moment when Shirone would be checkmated was approaching.

The barrage radius of Wind Cutter narrowed, and in Electric Mansion, a 100 percent charged bolt waited to be fired.

The moment came when Shirone's movement was perfectly blocked.

Dante instantly found Electric Cannon's address in the memory matrix and transmitted it to Pascal.

'Now!'

The moment Dante thought that.

'Now!'

Shirone had the same thought.

The moment Electric Cannon's energy filled the mansion, a flash concentrated before Shirone's eyes.

Dante snorted. No matter how strong Photon Cannon was, full power Electric Cannon would destroy even that and dominate the space.

At that moment, Shirone cast his lethal magic.

Shining Impact!

Photons compressed by unifying their polarization direction exploded.

Then into Dante's mind, which had been full of 1s and 0s, came information consisting only of 1s.

The simplest but unprocessable size of information.

Pascal overloaded and the automaton momentarily stopped. The students were shocked. He had caused a light explosion to paralyze Dante's system.

A strategy that wouldn't work twice. Shirone had clearly saved this one opportunity solely for this moment.

Dante's mind was as pale as the Shining Impact. Having a gap of nearly one second occur in calculations that processed thousands of pieces of information per second was fatal.

Dante covered his face with both arms. He couldn't even predict what kind of attack would come.

But Shirone didn't move. As he concentrated his mind, a clear light was born before his eyes and drew a massive circle. It was the Halo, the angel's magic circle he had become proficient with through lifting training.

Nade jumped up and shouted.

"Ataraxia!"

It was the appearance of what could be called Shirone's ultimate technique. But Nade soon wore a puzzled expression.

Even if the halo was completed, information accumulation was a separate issue. Since it required a full minute, it wasn't yet at a stage where it could be applied in actual combat.

Iruki frowned and said.

"It's the worst move."

When Nade agreed with silence, Iruki continued.

"But it's also the only move. He's done everything he can. If not now, there won't be another chance to activate Ataraxia."

Dante barely grasped his fading consciousness. He never imagined that exploding light could paralyze the system.

But there would be no more opportunities.

Shirone too had exhausted all strategies and was merely struggling as a last resort. As the automaton regained function, the mansions all turned toward Shirone in unison.

Even while looking at the ominously floating magic circle, Shirone focused on constructing the Halo. A pale flash traced a large trajectory based on pi and returned to its starting point. Finally, the Halo - the angel's mind - stood like a shield in front of Shirone.

"Ugh! What is that!"

Boyle clutched his head and cried out in pain. A summoning mage's measurement sense differs from other mages. To him, who could easily perceive even a millimeter of error, the perfect ring was violence delivered through form.

Seeing Boyle's condition, Iruki intuited it. This was shock delivered in a microscopic world indistinguishable to human senses.

From his perspective, he couldn't tell the difference between an ordinary circle and a perfect circle at all. But what about Dante, who could naturally read information entropy?

"Graaah!"

As Iruki suspected, Dante was suffering with blood vessels bulging in his neck. As shock was delivered to his mind, Pascal's function also dropped significantly.

'Damn it! Why is this suddenly happening? What the hell is that circle?'

Iruki held a glimmer of hope. Shirone had definitely calculated this far before activating Ataraxia.

But would this be enough?

Boyle had already recovered from the shock. Ironically, it was because his level was low.

Amy recalled what had happened in Heaven.

'I see. That's why Baalb back then...'

Ataraxia was a form that could deliver more powerful shock to those who had reached higher levels.

She finally understood the situation where the 2-angle Mara had stepped back before Shirone's Ataraxia in Heaven.

Then who would suffer the most from the Halo's appearance here?

Amy turned her gaze to look at Olivia. As expected, her shoulders were trembling.

'What on earth is that...'

Olivia bit her lip.

Positioned at the peak of human perception, she had nearly lost consciousness for a moment upon seeing the Halo.

Though she endured with a Great Magician's mental strength, a moment's gap at her level was fatal. It wasn't a level that could be mastered at Shirone's current stage.

'It's a circle that cannot be made with human ability. What is he trying to put in a space that can contain the entire world?'

The concept of Ataraxia began to be assembled into the Halo.

From outside the ring, colorful rays flew like a downpour and were carved like ripples on the magic circle.

Olivia thought that phenomenon was also impossible.

As far as she knew, it was impossible for information to enter from outside a magic circle. It was an optical illusion caused to human eyes due to the information accumulation speed approaching light speed.

'That's impossible...'

Having realized that much, Olivia's eyes were swept by shock. If it really was an accumulation speed close to light speed, any magic circle should be completed in less than a second to be normal. But even after 10 seconds passed, far from being completed, the speed was getting even faster.

That was dangerous.

Dante's judgment was the same. A massive concept assembly. If left alone, he would completely lose the advantage he had barely grasped.

"I can't let that happen."

Dante activated Electric Mansion. With the sound of wood splitting, electricity mixing white and blue shot out.

Shirone hurriedly threw his body aside. Ataraxia wasn't even half completed at that point. Moreover, bombardment began to resume from the automaton that had completely regained function.

Amy frowned with regret. As expected, using it in actual combat was too much. In the end, even the last opportunity gained through Shining Impact was wasted in vain.

"Huh?"

At that moment, Amy's eyes sparkled. Iruki and Nade also watched the Halo with expressions of disbelief.

Information continued to accumulate in the ring. But it was impossible. Shirone was still flying around everywhere to avoid the bombardment.

"What? What's going on?"

Iruki's mind spun rapidly. Was it really possible to perform teleportation and magic circle operation simultaneously? Shirone wasn't a Servant and couldn't operate Pascal like Dante.

'Definitely parallel circuits. No, is it something that appears parallel?'

At that moment, a flash of light passed through his mind.

"That's it!"

"Iruki, what's happening?"

When Amy asked with a surprised expression, Iruki shouted, unable to contain his excitement.

"Time division. He's doing time division."

Nade, finally understanding, slapped his knee.

"Ah! That's it! That would be possible!"

"What's time division? Can Shirone senior use two magics simultaneously?"

"He's chopping calculations into time units. He's switching between omniscience A and omniscience B at incredibly fast speed. ABABABAB, like that. Then a phenomenon occurs as if two magics are being deployed simultaneously."

Mark stood with his mouth agape. Even at the Unbridgeable Bridge, he had split time into ten-thousandths, but switching between two omnisciences was a completely different level of difficulty. It was possible because Shirone had precise insight rather than just knowledge.

Olivia became excited for the first time since the match began.

To attempt time division. This was a technique that even among active high-level mages, extremely few could perform.

'Is Shirone evolving too?'

Olivia glared at Alpheas with sharply raised eyes, then widened them in surprise.

A violent energy was surging in Alpheas' expression. His mouth was torn to below his ears and showed no sign of closing.

'Hehehe. Shirone, now you're finally being yourself.'

Even Alpheas hadn't expected Shirone to attempt time division. He wanted to give him a standing ovation.

When he first heard about Ataraxia, he had estimated at least four years. He thought that no matter how fast, that much training would be needed to utilize it in actual combat.

But Shirone had done it in just four months.

Using time division, the information accumulation speed would slow by about half, but compared to having to construct a magic circle defenseless for one minute, it didn't even count as a disadvantage.

Most of all, he wanted to see how powerful it would be. Just imagining the destructive power of information accumulated at light speed for over two minutes sent electricity through his body.

'Just a little, just a little more...!'

Shirone switched omniscience with all his might. Time division felt like juggling with thoughts. If he lost the afterimage of memory even for an instant, everything would be ruined.

Avoiding Dante's attacks in such a situation wasn't easy. But he didn't want to lose. He didn't care about the title of the Kingdom's best. If he couldn't defeat Dante here, it felt like he would never be able to move forward again.

Dante was anxious enough for his heart to burst. The automaton seemed like it would catch up to Shirone but couldn't quite catch up.

'Damn it! What the hell is happening?'

When would that magic circle activate?

If he could know at least that, he could formulate a strategy, but even he, who majored in information magic, couldn't decode the strange concept. The combination itself was impossible, but most of all, the size of the information was too enormous.
