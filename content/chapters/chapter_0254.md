When Ataraxia's accumulation rate exceeded 50 percent, the students began crying out in pain, unable to bear the heat from their bracelets.

Mark was also spinning his bracelet around as he asked Amy.

"Senior! This is really safe, right?"

Amy was also breaking out in cold sweat.

Honestly, she couldn't be certain. Even when the most brilliant magic users from the graduating class fought each other, the bracelets had never gotten this hot. It was clear that the Advanced Practice Hall couldn't process the amount of information from Ataraxia.

"I don't know either. It might explode, so be careful."

"Th-that's..."

Even so, Amy's gaze remained fixed on the Advanced Practice Hall. She was determined to see the results even if the bracelet exploded.

Seeing this, Mark followed his senior's example and stopped worrying. What did minor burns matter when witnessing a clash between geniuses of the century?

At that moment, surprisingly, Dante deactivated his automaton. If he continued being dragged along like this, Shirone's magic circle would be completed and the delicate balance of power would collapse.

Iruki was genuinely impressed.

"An excellent choice. He's even reading the flow of battle."

It's difficult to abandon a cherished strategy. Outsiders watching might say whatever they wanted, but the inertia of someone who had staked everything on the confrontation wasn't something that could be easily bent.

But Dante had broken through it.

Knowing that being swept up in the opponent's flow was most fatal in battle, he had once again entered unknown territory. This judgment alone clearly showed that Dante was a genius.

'Damn it! I've come this far, I absolutely won't lose!'

Dante converted his Spirit Zone to sniper mode. One hundred amplification magic circles stretched out in a line directly in front of Dante.

Ultra-precision serial magic circle formation - One Hundred Ways.

The magic circles rotated around an imaginary line and contracted inward.

The sleek serial structure, designed solely for power amplification, couldn't tolerate even a millimeter of error.

When the automaton was deactivated, Shirone could focus on Ataraxia. But his feelings were actually more despairing.

If things had gone as originally planned, victory would have been his. But Dante had created yet another variable.

'Amazing, Dante. Well, I would have done the same...'

Now it was a battle of who could construct their magic circle first.

Dante's One Hundred Ways had a much shorter activation time than Ataraxia, but Shirone had already accumulated over 70 percent of the information through Time Division.

A smile formed on Dante's lips. Even though hundreds of magic circles had disappeared, Pascal was still intact.

"This is the difference between you and me."

Shirone realized what he had overlooked and looked down. Before he knew it, a spatial movement magic circle had been carved beneath his feet.

Shirone's body sank into the ground, then appeared in the sky and fell head-first to exactly the same spot.

"Damn! There was such a trick!"

Nade slammed his fist down in frustration. While constructing One Hundred Ways, Dante could still attack as much as he wanted.

Of course, this was also just commentary from an observer, but if he truly wanted to win, he should have been more careful about it.

Iruki sighed as if resigned. Shirone had also shown tremendous skill. It's just that Dante had one tiny additional thing.

"It was a good match. I have to acknowledge it."

Nade trembled his fists in frustration. It wasn't that he hated Dante - he hated Dante's perfection.

"That bastard. He deliberately chose spatial movement magic."

"The Advanced Practice Hall has blocking judgments for active magic. Attack magic gives Shirone room to endure. So he delivered a physical blow instead. That's what makes him the kingdom's greatest defense."

In the meantime, Dante's One Hundred Ways was completed. Then Fire Strike was loaded at the starting point of the amplification tunnel.

Dante, having regained his composure, smiled and said,

"This is the end...!"

Dante's words cut off abruptly.

The students, wondering what was wrong, followed Dante's gaze. Then they opened their eyes wide in shock.

Even though Shirone had lost consciousness, Ataraxia was still remaining in place.

Ping.

A drop of information fell into the Halo.

Ping. Ping ping.

Another drop. And then two more drops.

Ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping!

Finally, light began pouring in at tremendous speed.

The rotation of the light ring accelerated further, and brilliant multicolored light that couldn't be tracked by the eye filled the Halo completely.

Olivia stood up abruptly as if she couldn't believe it.

"Impossible! Information imagining itself!"

Alpheas was equally surprised. But if one knew whose ability Shirone's Ataraxia belonged to, such a phenomenon was only natural.

"It's not human logic. An information system that thinks for itself once it passes the critical point. Isn't that why it's called heavenly magic?"

Olivia asked back with a bewildered expression.

"Heavenly magic? What are you talking about?"

Alpheas held his words. Eventually, after this match ended, she would find out, but at this moment, heaven wasn't what mattered.

"We've finally reached our destination. This is where the match will be decided."

As if telling her not to miss the good show, Alpheas pointed at the Advanced Practice Hall with his chin, and Olivia also turned her head.

Shirone, having regained consciousness, slowly stood up. With his head bowed, light burst in front of him and photons for Photon Cannon were born. A single Photon Cannon crafted with the last remnant of mental power.

"Damn it!"

Dante barely suppressed his urge to scream and fired Fire Strike. The burning spear of air broke through the magic circles and grew in size.

At that moment, a magic circle was completed in front of Shirone.

Ultra-power amplification circle Ataraxia.

Shirone watched the scene of Fire Strike, amplified by One Hundred Ways, rushing toward him. Then he fired Photon Cannon toward the center of that fire demon.

The scene of photons penetrating through Ataraxia entered everyone's eyes in slow motion.

And finally, the moment it crossed the line.

Flash!

The world filled with light.

All objects beyond Ataraxia were swept away by the massive storm of mass.

The momentary flash reached people's perception somewhat slowly, and wrinkles in the air were revealed as if peeling away even the skin of space itself, pushing everything away.

Clink! Clink! Clink! Clink!

Simultaneously, the sound of breaking glass erupted repeatedly from where the students were gathered. Overloaded with information processing, all the crystal spheres in the bracelets shattered. The Advanced Practice Hall stopped operating, and the landscape created by simulation disappeared.

Like a midsummer night's dream, the spectacle vanished and only dry physical blocks entered their sight.

No one spoke.

They had no time for other thoughts, busy trying to comprehend what magic they had just witnessed. Even the teachers had never seen magic on such a massive scale before.

Everyone's gaze concentrated on Shirone and Dante.

Seeing the two people standing purely at the same distance as at the beginning, the students began to murmur.

The variable was that Dante hadn't collapsed.

Shirone's magic had power that no one could block. You could tell just from the fact that the amount of information exceeded the Advanced Practice Hall's memory. If this had been real combat, the entity called Dante would have disappeared without a trace.

But this was the Advanced Practice Hall, and Dante was standing.

Even with a sync rate of 50 percent, if Anti-Magic had entered, he should have already lost consciousness.

Perhaps the Advanced Practice Hall's system had crashed before the impact could register. If so, determining winners and losers would become somewhat forced.

Considering this was a match between students at the school, there was a high possibility the faculty would conclude this incident as a beautiful draw.

But that wasn't what Shirone's friends, or the students who had watched the battle until now, wanted.

Shirone and Dante had fought a legendary match that could remain in history.

It was a selfish thought, but the students who had been present wanted their memories to reach a definitive conclusion.

Shirone gasped for breath while glaring at Dante. Since the Advanced Practice Hall had disappeared, there was nothing to do but watch, but in truth he was so exhausted he could do nothing but breathe.

"Haha..."

Dante let out a hollow laugh. But he too was exhausted to his limit and words didn't come easily. He tried to take a step with difficulty but eventually stopped without managing three steps.

Through his slightly parted lips, his voice leaked out.

"You..."

At that moment, blood poured from Dante's nose with a thud. Then his pupils gradually lost their vitality, and like a giant tree falling, he collapsed to the floor while still in standing position.

Iruki said with a trembling voice.

"It went through. Anti-Magic entered before the system shut down."

Iruki's voice was small, but like telepathy, it spread from student to student.

"He lost, right? Dante lost, right?"

"It seems so? Dante... that Dante was defeated."

At that moment, as if under mass hypnosis, all the students stood up and burst into cheers. The sound waves mixed together and the air in the hall vibrated powerfully.

"Shirone won! Shirone defeated Dante, the kingdom's greatest!"

Mark barely managed to recover his spirit that had flown to the ends of the sky. Hearing the students' shouts, just as his tension seemed to ease, another emotion began pounding his chest.

It was the moment Shirone ascended as the kingdom's greatest star.

"Waaaaah! Senior Shirone won! Now you know who's the best, right? Huh? Come at me! If anyone wants to challenge him again, try it!"

Mark was ecstatic as if he had won himself. Right next to him, Dante's friends sat with cold expressions, but with adrenaline overflowing, such trivial thoughts had long been erased from his mind.

Killine muttered as if dreaming.

"My god... Dante..."

It was an unbelievable result. But Dante's figure with his face buried in the cold physical blocks was an undeniable fact.

473 battles, 472 victories.

And 1 defeat.

It was Dante's first defeat since entering the world of magic, and the end of his undefeated record maintained for 10 years.

Olivia remained in place with a calm expression, buried in the sounds of students cheering from all directions.

She was worried about Dante but still had to maintain neutrality.

Siena checked on Dante and signaled that he was fine. Only then did a small sigh escape her lips.

'Dante lost.'

She had never once doubted Dante's victory. But strangely, when he actually lost, no emotional turmoil arose.

Maybe it was because it still didn't feel real, but it had been such a magnificent match that it was acceptable to think it couldn't be helped.

'I have to acknowledge this. Dante poured out everything too. Shirone was stronger. That's all. But...'

The magic Shirone had cast at the end. What exactly was the power of that magic? From its nature, it was clearly Photon Cannon, Shirone's specialty.

But she could say with certainty that it was definitely not Photon Cannon.

Even she, a specialist in incantation magic, would need to be fully committed to produce such power. No, setting aside the power, the problem was the amplification beyond common sense. Even she would find it impossible to raise a student-level Photon Cannon to the power of a Great Magician.

Olivia looked back at Alpheas. As expected, seeing his lack of particular comment, he had clearly known from the beginning.

Was his anticipation of the battle with Dante also because he wanted to see the miracle that might occur with very small probability? Like a boy rubbing his hands in front of an intriguing toy.

'Cunning old fox. He completely fooled me, didn't he?'

Olivia ground her teeth with a resentful gaze. But Alpheas, whom she thought would gleefully mock her, kept his mouth shut for a long time, lost in thought.

'Was the power this great?'

Ultra-power amplification circle Ataraxia.

He had heard tales of Shirone's exploits and made some predictions, but the power witnessed firsthand was different from what he'd heard described.

Most importantly, this was a match supervised by the kingdom's teachers' council. A correspondent had come and even brought video recording equipment.

With this much, the royal castle couldn't help but make a move.
