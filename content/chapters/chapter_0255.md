If they possessed Ataraxia, Alpheas Magic School's reputation would rise dramatically in an instant. Moreover, with Olivia's help, it would even be possible to topple the stronghold of the Royal Magic School.

Having thought that far, Alpheas spoke quietly.

"Thad."

Thad approached and bowed his head.

"Yes, Master."

"Collect the black boxes from the Advanced Practice Hall immediately. They must not be given to anyone. And destroy them in front of Shirone. Make sure Shirone confirms they've been destroyed."

"Understood."

Thad answered without complaint and bowed his head.

His bracelet's crystal sphere was also destroyed.

Since this had never happened once while managing the Advanced Practice Hall, he instinctively sensed that the situation might become more serious than expected.

Of course, the bigger the incident became, the more the school's name would spread, but if it was Alpheas's instruction, there was no need for personal considerations.

Olivia's fierce gaze changed to one of bewilderment.

She had long known his uncompromising personality, but she hadn't expected him to make such a stubborn decision.

"Are you sure about this? The black boxes contain all the information from this duel. Not only Dante's Pascal but also Shirone's magic formations. If we just made copies, it would be tremendously helpful. Even if the Kingdom puts security restrictions on it, they'll pay an enormous sum to take it away."

Olivia subtly tested him, but Alpheas didn't even hesitate.

"It belongs to Shirone. No one should access that information without Shirone's permission."

"Shirone might give permission, you know. Think about it carefully. He might make the decision for his alma mater's prosperity, and above all, it would contribute to magical society. Shirone is also benefiting from what countless genius magicians have achieved."

Olivia's words were valid to some extent. Without the noble sacrifices, challenges, efforts, and talents passed down from previous generations, human magic wouldn't have developed this far.

That's why Alpheas himself had submitted his quantum theory paper that revolutionized photon magic to the state like a献納.

But Alpheas's thoughts remained unchanged.

"As long as Shirone is alive, he can choose at any time. But not now. When he truly feels it's necessary, he can decide for himself. Presenting choices like this would be no different from coercion."

Olivia clicked her tongue. He was still stubbornly principled, first-class as always.

'Well... that's why I liked him, though.'

The duel was over, but no students left their seats.

They wanted to witness the highlight of this match - the sight of Dante kneeling before Shirone.

However, the defeated Dante wasn't easily regaining consciousness despite the teachers' recovery magic.

Sabina shook her head and sobbed.

"Dante lost. No, this can't be happening. He's defeated so many strong opponents until now - his undefeated record can't be broken at such a backwater school."

"Sabina, calm down. Let's just hope Dante is safe for now."

Closer grabbed Sabina's shoulder to calm her, but Sabina was already too emotional to accept reality.

Don't we all have days like that? When variables that shouldn't logically happen keep occurring, and everything goes wrong?

For Dante, today was one of those days.

"Dante is invincible! His synchronization rate was even 50 percent. At the Royal Magic School, he's fought with it set to 100 percent! There's no way he'd lose to such a country bumpkin!"

"Hmph, that was just simulation anyway."

At Canis's words, Sabina whipped her head around.

"What?"

"Dante has never fought a giant. Or an archangel either."

"What are you saying now? I won't tolerate mocking Dante!"

"I'm asking if he's ever risked his life fighting an absolutely unwinnable enemy. Whether it's the Advanced Practice Hall or 100 percent synchronization rate doesn't matter. Real combat isn't like that."

Sabina gritted her teeth.

Amy continued the conversation.

"Dante doesn't know real combat. Of course, he has enough skill to work in actual battles. But Shirone has always risked his life to get to this point."

Canis nodded.

"The Advanced Practice Hall. It's similar to real combat. But it's not real combat, is it? Something like that isn't even fun. Do you know what it means to risk your life? When you stand on the boundary between life and death, your thoughts stop and you can only think about wanting to live. Fighting while somehow maintaining reason in that situation - that's real combat."

Sabina fumed like a child. Having been beaten up by Nade, she could understand what situation Canis was describing.

But they didn't know with what resolve Dante had fought.

Even if they belittled it as simulation, even with the mockery that he'd only fought opponents he could beat, there was an unchanging fact.

For Dante, the Advanced Practice Hall duel was everything in his life.

Tears welled up in Sabina's eyes.

"No. That's not true. Dante... Dante really fought risking his life."

Silence flowed for a while. Shirone's friends didn't want to mock Dante's group anymore either.

No, honestly, the satisfaction from their rampage over the semester couldn't be resolved by this alone.

But Dante was strong. Strong enough that having him as a rival competing on the same level was enjoyable. Though he lost to Shirone, in the end, he had maintained his friends' dignity while falling.

After an awkward time passed, Dante finally regained consciousness.

The students who had been chattering excitedly all fell silent at once and turned their heads toward the Advanced Practice Hall.

Sabina and Closer felt sorry. They wished he had stayed unconscious until the end of the day, but the problem was that the student with the strongest defense also had quick recovery.

When Shirone approached, the students held their breath. Dante struggled to look up at Shirone, then lowered his head again as if he couldn't manage it. And he began muttering something to himself.

Shirone waited silently.

Finally, Dante stopped muttering and raised his head again.

There would be no more exchange of information. Winner and loser had been decided, and all that remained was claiming the spoils.

"Kill me."

Dante made a shocking declaration.

Shirone clamped his mouth shut and glared at Dante.

Murmuring sounds could be heard here and there. No one had expected him to say he'd rather die than kneel.

Words flowed saying he was immature or unmanly for being stubborn.

But Sabina knew. Dante's words weren't stubbornness or childish remarks.

—I'm going to become the greatest magician. To do that, I have to train in the Advanced Practice Hall like real combat.

—But Dante, no matter what, the Advanced Practice Hall is still simulation. There are judgments, and it's bound to differ from real combat.

Sabina couldn't forget what Dante had said then.

—That may be true. But training the same as other students won't make me a Great Magician. So I've decided. If I ever lose in the Advanced Practice Hall, it will mean my death.

Of course, he was young then.

Sabina had thought it was just resolve before a match.

But as time passed, she came to know Dante's sincerity.

Through 150 battles, 200 battles, there had been many situations where he could have lost.

But in the end, Dante claimed victory.

After surpassing 400 battles, Dante must have felt those words becoming a blade driving him forward.

As a result, Dante grew rapidly and achieved the remarkable record of 472 wins in 472 battles.

Alpheas sensed things were taking an unusual turn.

"To think he had such thoughts."

He looked back at Olivia, but she also shook her head, hearing this for the first time. She hadn't even imagined that Dante had truly risked his life in the duel. The will to become the greatest magician was admirable, but it was too extreme for an 18-year-old boy's resolve.

Then she suddenly realized.

Because he was an 18-year-old boy, the pressure to maintain the top position would have been even greater.

Featured in magazines, revered by all students, defeating rivals - how could it have been only good?

There was certainly some responsibility of her own in Dante's extreme choice.

Dante spoke once more as if it wasn't a lie.

"Kill me. I've never once thought about losing to someone. This is my defeat. If you don't want to dirty your hands, I'll do it myself. But I will never kneel to you."

Shirone lowered his head and sighed.

Dante was making a very serious mistake. How he handled his own life was his business, but once he spoke it aloud, it would become hurt for someone and anger for someone else.

"You lost... so you'll die?"

"Yes. That's the resolve I brought to this duel."

"Why? What makes you so special?"

The students' eyes widened in surprise. Dante shuddered with shame. But at this moment, the most emotional person was Shirone.

"You so easily tell others to kneel, but you can't even do that much yourself?"

"You're talking nonsense. I truly risked my life. I'm saying that I, who might become a lifelong rival, will remove myself."

"Are you that great?"

Dante's expression crumpled again. Though he had lost, they had fought a good duel. He thought Shirone would understand his feelings.

"I think I lived up to the reputation of the Kingdom's greatest talent. Of course, I don't intend to make excuses. But you didn't beat me easily either, did you?"

"The Kingdom's greatest? So what can you do? Can you stop a war?"

"What?"

"If you're such a great person, try changing even one small thing. You can't do anything. So why are you risking your life over defeat?"

Dante's expression twisted, but regardless, Shirone continued his barrage.

"You can't stop wars, famine, civil wars, anything. But what? The Kingdom's greatest? You think you're so great?"

Dante's breathing became labored. Each of Shirone's words pierced his head, chest, and heart like daggers. He was falling like that. Something that made up who he was plummeted into an abyss.

"Even if you die, the world won't change. No one will think seriously about your death."

Dante couldn't bear it anymore. If he stayed like this, he felt he would fall to rock bottom.

"Shut up! Are you getting cocky just because you won once? Shall we really fight for real this time?"

"Dante."

Shirone looked at him with pitying eyes.

"You're just human."

Dante's face turned pale. He felt like something surrounding his shell was shattering completely.

Suddenly, Canis's words came to mind.

—You'll feel like you're being trampled to the very bottom of what you can imagine.

It hadn't been a challenge to fight from the beginning. Canis's words had been fact without an ounce of exaggeration.

"Not even a Great Magician - no person can change the world alone. Because they're human. That's why you don't have any qualification to die either."

The students fell silent with solemn hearts. Even those who had mocked Shirone for refusing to fight Dante felt the same.

The business card reading "The Kingdom's Greatest Talent."

It was certainly a dream-like title for aspiring magicians. But seen from afar, it too was merely a concept less than human, created by human hands.

"That child is...?"

Olivia asked Alpheas. Who Shirone was would be detailed in student records, but that wasn't what she wanted to know.

Alpheas finally revealed the truth.

"Shirone... met Miro. And he met Archangel Ikael in Heaven."

Olivia turned her head with a surprised expression.

Alpheas nodded with a bitter smile.

"Yes. He's one of the few humans who knows the truth."

Olivia fell into deep thought.

Even now, this world was maintained by one magician.

Knowing that fact, all human affairs would seem even more trivial in Shirone's eyes.

"He's a strong child. Most would have been terrified or given up."

"He wasn't like that from the beginning. He was a shy child who didn't talk much."

Alpheas recalled the day he met Shirone. The twelve-year-old boy who had pressed his ear to the wall to audit his classes had now grown into a prospect who could be presented anywhere in the Kingdom without shame.
