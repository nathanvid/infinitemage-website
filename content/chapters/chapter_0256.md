"Competition isn't just a system for determining who's number one. It's a process of clashing with countless philosophies to find your own. Being obsessed with rankings is foolish."

Olivia looked at Dante with pity.

There was no lie in Shirone's words. Changing the world was on a completely different dimension from taking first place in magic school.

McClain Guffin, called the most powerful magician in human history despite the fact that his very existence couldn't even be confirmed.

And his chosen successor, Adrias Miro.

Even they had to make enormous sacrifices to protect this world.

"Can Dante become as strong as Shirone too?"

"Everyone will become strong. All the students here."

Olivia closed her eyes.

With this, the confrontation was over. And her long-standing connection with Alpheas would end here as well.

"I lost. I'll step down from the principal position and leave the school."

Alpheas said with a sly smile.

"You could stay if you wanted to?"

"What are you talking about? My term is ending soon anyway."

"Stay at the school and help me out. I'm getting old and it's hard to manage alone. In other words, I'm asking you to become the vice principal of this school."

Olivia's eyes narrowed.

Asking someone who had served as principal of the Royal Magic School to become a vice principal. And under the detestably annoying Alpheas at that.

She had tried to bury it all here. Since she could never beat this cunning snake no matter what she did, she had tried to forget and move on with her life.

But it seemed Alpheas couldn't bear not tormenting her until the very end.

Of course, she could guess his intentions. If Jerome Olivia served as vice principal, the school's reputation would skyrocket instantly. Moreover, the innovations she had achieved during her stay here were considerable.

That's exactly why she had to refuse.

She couldn't fall for Alpheas's scheme to catch two rabbits at once - reputation and ability.

"Vice principal? Am I crazy? Why should I help you do such a thing?"

Without hesitation, Alpheas played his trump card.

"That night... when you came to see me..."

"Stop! Please!"

Olivia squeezed her eyes shut and shouted.

Could there be such a cruel person in this world? What kind of grudge did he have against her?

When someone who hadn't contacted her once in over ten years suddenly appeared, she had thought it was her chance for revenge.

But now she deeply regretted not coldly turning him away the day he came to see her.

Tears began to well up in Olivia's eyes.

"You're... truly selfish."

Alpheas put aside his joking and spoke seriously.

"Don't be like that. Stay with me. When we have free time, we can drink tea together and tend to the flower garden. And... you can pay your respects to Erina too."

Murderous intent filled Olivia's eyes. To tell her to pay respects to his deceased wife when he clearly knew her feelings.

Why did she have to endure such humiliation?

She had only loved him. What had she done wrong that this man wanted to drag her to the depths of hell?

"You really...!"

Olivia was about to raise her voice when she stopped, seeing the look in Alpheas's eyes. A different emotion from before was revealed in his pupils.

"You, don't tell me..."

Alpheas shook his head. He knew Olivia would be disappointed, but he couldn't hurt her twice.

But it was also an undeniable fact that things were different from thirty years ago. Perhaps that was true.

"Don't misunderstand. Yes, I know what you're thinking, but honestly, I'm not confident. I might never be able to let go of Erina until I die. I can't guarantee you anything."

Olivia's eyes grew a little colder. But not as much as at first.

"Then why are you doing this? What can you get from me while keeping your dead wife in your heart? What, something physical? Are you so lonely in your old age that it cuts to the bone?"

Alpheas looked up at the sky.

"Maybe that could be it. This isn't a rational conclusion. I just felt that if not now, there would be no more opportunities. That's all."

Olivia wore a blank expression. Alpheas smiled awkwardly. Even to him, it sounded ridiculous.

"Is this a bit selfish?"

Olivia shook her head.

"No. You want to know what's really selfish? This is the first time you've ever been honest about your feelings."

"I'm sorry. I couldn't help it then. You know that - that I couldn't help it."

Olivia let out a long breath and fell into thought.

"So what are you really asking me to do? To cling to you again at this age? Because you might possibly accept me?"

"I don't really know my own heart yet either. No matter how long you live in this world, you don't understand things like this. But I'll try."

Olivia forcibly held back the tears that threatened to surge forth.

She should be angry at such a selfish proposal, but the moment she heard him say he would try, she felt pathetic and miserable watching her anger fade away.

Olivia let out a deep sigh. She understood Alpheas's words a little. Honestly, she didn't want to live calculatingly at this point either.

A second-class Great Magician. Having achieved everything there was to achieve, what was there left to fear in life?

She could simply let herself go with the flow of emotions and time. She thought she was at an age where that was acceptable.

"Show me the library. Let's start by having tea."

This time Alpheas looked surprised. His wife lived in the library. He already knew she was a foolish woman, but he hadn't expected her to put everything down again.

Reading Alpheas's thoughts, Olivia wagged her finger.

"Don't get the wrong idea. That doesn't mean I've accepted your proposal."

"Then why the library specifically?"

Olivia recalled something from long ago. Vandalizing Erina's portrait in front of Alpheas was still an unforgettable nightmare in her memory.

"I have something to apologize to Erina for..."

A smile finally spread across Alpheas's face.

"Of course. Shall we go then?"

When Alpheas left first, Olivia also glanced at the other teachers, cleared her throat once, and followed behind him.

The teachers were utterly bewildered.

Though they couldn't hear the details of their conversation, they had expected one of the two to be in trouble since the confrontation was over.

But after making their students fight to the death, the two were now walking off to the library together, leaving everyone stunned.

Meanwhile, Killine, who had been riding high on Dante's interviews, was in despair. This could be seen as the birth of a new star, but the problem was her own future.

She had monopolized the star called Dante until now. But he had ultimately faded, and now it was Shirone's world.

Countless correspondents would be scrambling to get to Shirone, so the competition would be no joke.

And their first target for elimination would naturally be herself.

Killine's eyes sparkled as she racked her brain. Since things had come to this, she had no choice but to make one big score to lay the foundation for the future.

While everyone else was trying to catch Shirone, she would bet against the trend and aim for an exclusive story.

Killine walked toward the video recorder. But when she actually arrived, the video recording device was rolling around on the ground.

Watching in bewilderment, she asked with cold eyes.

"What happened? Why is this thing knocked over?"

"Oh, well... all the bracelets were broken, you see. The video recording device is linked to them. That's how it can film battles. So it fell over with a bang at the end."

The video recorder shrugged as if it had been unavoidable.

Killine was about to unleash a barrage of curses but took a deep breath to calm herself.

Obscura was a delicate device that could break from the slightest shock.

"Check it quickly! The Obscura, I mean. Without that, we can't publish anything as an article."

"Ah, understood."

The video recorder opened the main unit and examined the inside.

After rummaging around inside for quite a while, he let out a sigh of relief and turned his head.

"It's fine. The Obscura is safe."

Killine's heart rate finally returned to normal.

"Phew, that's a relief."

Siena, who had safely sent the students back and finished her duties, approached.

"What's wrong? Is there some problem?"

The video recorder burst into hearty laughter.

"Ahaha, well..."

Killine suddenly shouted.

"This can't be!"

It was an action like a correspondent's instinct.

When the video recorder and Siena turned around with puzzled expressions, she put on a sad act.

"The Obscura has cracked. A damaged Obscura cannot play video. In the end, we couldn't capture anything."

Siena also sighed in regret. Today's confrontation had been high-level enough to serve as educational material for countless students.

The fact that the Obscura containing Shirone and Dante's battle had broken was a loss for the entire kingdom, beyond personal disappointment.

But on the other hand, she felt it was fortunate.

She had heard that Principal Alpheas had instructed Thad to destroy the black box.

Of course, what was contained in the Obscura was just simple video, but since things had turned out this way, it was better to enforce restrictions thoroughly.

"Oh dear, that's unfortunate. My condolences."

Siena offered words of comfort, half sincere and half not, then left.

When she was gone, the video recorder looked at Killine as if asking what she was doing.

But nothing entered her eyes. Only one thought filled her head completely.

She would remain the Magic Association's top correspondent forever.

'Hehehe! Exclusive, it's an exclusive!'

**The Truth Revealed (1)**

A week had passed since Shirone and Dante's confrontation ended.

Olivia was still serving as interim principal, and rumors circulated that she would return as vice principal from the next semester.

It was shocking news for the students.

Olivia was a second-class Great Magician.

It would be one thing if she returned to the Royal Magic School, but it was unimaginable that she would work under Alpheas.

But if the rumors were true, it would be truly exciting.

With the virtuous Alpheas at the helm and Olivia, the kingdom's finest teacher, joining the school, the school's recognition would leap dramatically.

Perhaps because of this, even during what should have been a chaotic time with only a month left in the semester, the students' academic atmosphere was good.

Olivia often took walks with Alpheas.

The two still disagreed like fire and water, but no one had seen them get into major fights.

Olivia would flare up like fire, but as soon as Alpheas said anything, she would clam up as if cold water had been poured on her.

Based on this, the teachers and students thought Olivia must have some weakness that Alpheas had caught onto.

Today too, Olivia spent leisurely time walking around the campus with Alpheas.

Since most of the curriculum had been revised during the semester, only the teachers were busy.

"I'm going to plant roses on this side."

Olivia said while spreading her arms as if measuring the width of the flower bed.

Passing students saw her and greeted her.

"Hello, Principal Olivia!"

Olivia welcomed them with a warm smile.

"Yes, are you done with classes?"

"Yes. We're heading to the library now."

"I see. But it's practical period - don't you need to go to the training ground?"

"Ah, we had the Image Realm class today. We're trying to manage our condition. We didn't realize before, but now that the Image Realm has been introduced, it seems tough combined with the practical period."

"That could be the case. I'll bring it up at the teachers' meeting."

"Really? Thank you so much!"

The students left for the library, overjoyed.

Rather than adhering to grand philosophies, responding quickly to improve efficiency was Olivia's educational policy.

"Principal!"

Thad came running from afar, shouting. From his expression, it looked like something big had happened.

But having been through all sorts of situations, Alpheas and Olivia didn't worry in advance.

"What's the matter, Teacher Thad?"

Thad was panting and swallowing saliva when he pulled out a magazine tucked behind him.

It was *Spirit*, the magazine published by the teachers' council.

Olivia belatedly sensed the situation.

Indeed, since an unknown student had defeated the kingdom's greatest talent Dante, she could imagine without seeing how much they had exaggerated it.
