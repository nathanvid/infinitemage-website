"Come to think of it, today is the publication date. I hope our school's story came out well?"

Olivia asked as she took the magazine.

When she said "our school," Alpheas smiled warmly.

But the pleasant atmosphere disappeared the moment they saw the cover.

The headline contained shocking content.

*Breaking! Interview with Shirone's Parents!*

*The Student Who Defeated Dante is a Mountain Hunter's Child?*

Olivia tilted her head in confusion.

An interview with his parents, not Shirone himself? And what did they mean by "mountain hunter's child"?

While Killine had a harsh nature, she wasn't foolish enough to publish a ridiculous distortion article.

Cold sweat ran down Alpheas's spine.

It wasn't a distortion article—it was the truth.

Currently, only a very few people at the school knew about Shirone's background.

Of course, if Killine had decided to investigate his personal information, it would have been very easy to dig up. With a professional correspondent's investigative skills, Shirone's parents wouldn't have been able to withstand it.

Olivia opened the magazine and quickly read through the article.

The process of how Shirone had subdued Dante was written in detail, complete with photographs.

She had heard that the Obscura was broken, but that must have been a lie.

However, the article wasn't false.

There were limits to distortion—if she had written such an article through fabrication, it would undoubtedly be grounds for dismissal.

'True? Shirone is... a mountain hunter's child?'

Olivia looked back at Alpheas as if demanding an explanation.

Alpheas nodded with a bitter expression.

"It's true. Shirone is a mountain hunter's child. But I admitted him through special admission with a recommendation from the Ozent family. Even the teachers don't know. Thad didn't know either."

Olivia showed her hurt feelings.

"That doesn't matter. Why did you hide it from me too? At least I, as the principal, should have known."

Alpheas also felt wronged.

He knew better than anyone that Olivia was a careful person who could keep secrets. The problem was that he hadn't expected something like this to happen.

"Hide or not hide, I wasn't even keeping it in mind. It's already been a year, and no one was curious about Shirone's background."

When Alpheas spoke with a dejected expression, Olivia also stopped her complaints and fell into thought.

Shirone's character certainly had unique aspects. When spending time with him, it was true that one wouldn't pay much attention to his background.

But when many people gather in one place, anything can happen.

"Anyway, you're so naive. No matter how many allies Shirone has, there are bound to be students who envy him. You should always be thinking about these things. If I had known, this wouldn't have happened in the first place."

Even Alpheas had nothing to say this time.

He was excellent at caring for students, but had no talent for politics whatsoever.

Olivia crossed her arms, pondered deeply, then made her decision.

"Teacher Thad."

"Yes, Principal."

"Call Killine immediately. Tell her to come to me as soon as she receives word. If she doesn't come within 24 hours, tell her I'll come find her myself."

"Understood."

Thad bowed his head and turned away.

When Shirone's background was revealed, Alpheas Magic School was turned upside down.

The teachers were also shocked, but as expected, it was the students who were talking.

Olivia's prediction was accurate.

Although it seemed like everyone liked Shirone, there definitely existed a minority of students who had been swept along by the crowd's flow and couldn't voice their opinions. They were the type who envied Shirone's talent.

Now that this incident had erupted, they began denouncing Shirone like fish that had found water.

The school cafeteria after classes was swarming with students.

Partly because they had free time after the advanced class practical exams ended, but also because the library wasn't suitable for discussing the hot topic of Shirone.

Particularly, the mid-tier group of Class Four occupying a corner table was enthusiastically tearing down Shirone as if they were being paid to do so.

"Tch! Does this make sense? We've been attending school with a commoner."

"Not just any commoner either. A mountain hunter, they say. The level is so low I can't stand attending anymore."

"No wonder he sometimes seemed dim. You can't hide your origins. He's only been learning magic for a year. That's why he couldn't even cast basic magic."

Of course, they were ignoring one fact.

That same Shirone had become the best in the advanced class in just one year. No, the best in the kingdom.

Everyone felt the contradiction, but no one voiced it aloud.

What they wanted was to completely bring down Shirone with this opportunity, whether he was a genius or not.

Closer, who was leaning against the vending machine, grumbled as he watched their antics.

"What a complete mess. Even without Shirone, they couldn't even get close to first place."

Sabina also disliked the sight of them hiding in a corner and badmouthing someone.

Of course, Shirone was also an enemy she couldn't like. But the pride of having competed head-on with the top group refused comparison with those people.

"Dante, what do you think?"

"About what?"

Dante wasn't paying attention to the gossip about Shirone and was staring at the menu board above the vending machine.

"About Shirone. It is pretty shocking, actually. That he wasn't nobility."

Dante blinked, then looked around at his friends and asked.

"Hey, what do you guys want to drink?"

Sabina raised her hand and said.

"I'll have orange juice. My skin's been dull lately, so I need to get some vitamin C."

"Really? Then I'm thirsty, so iced coffee. Closer, what about you?"

Closer stared intently at Dante.

The day after losing the Two Thousand Times battle, Dante didn't even come to class and took a rest. The school had been considerate since Anti-Magic had properly taken effect, but in reality, what was hurt was probably his heart, not his mind.

After that day passed, Dante appeared before people the next day.

It was natural that the children's attention focused on him, but he attended classes with the same attitude as usual, as if nothing had happened.

'Dante, are you really okay?'

He couldn't tell what Dante was thinking.

If he was planning revenge, he would be preparing for a match, and if he acknowledged Shirone, it would be right to leave school. The semester was ending anyway, so it was time to start packing.

But Dante didn't say anything about future matters.

"Um, Senior Dante..."

A girl from Class Five approached Dante with a blushing face.

"Yeah?"

Dante looked back at her while biting the straw stuck in his iced coffee.

"Um, I watched that battle with great impression."

Closer and Sabina felt their hearts drop.

Even if you lack tact, there should be limits—to bring up something the person involved was keeping quiet about.

But the thoughtless girl seemed to believe that if you were sincere, you could say anything.

"Although you lost, I don't think Senior Dante was defeated. You know, there's such a thing as eternal rivals. In the next battle, Senior Dante will definitely be able to win."

Sabina sneakily watched Dante's reaction.

Contrary to expectations, Dante didn't show any particular emotion, just blinked and said casually.

"Yeah, thanks."

Dante's friends were shocked.

This was Dante, who thought a single defeat meant death. Such a calm reaction was rather abnormal.

'Don't tell me the shock of defeat has made his head strange?'

The girl who had received thanks from Dante returned to her friends' table with an excited face.

Come to think of it, all the students were watching this way. The conversation had stopped at some point, and the cafeteria was quiet.

Dante realized that attention was pouring on him and only then looked around. Then, as if it didn't matter, he sat at an empty table and sipped his coffee.

Closer brought the same coffee that Dante had ordered, slammed it down on the table with a thud, sat across from him, and asked in a whispered tone.

"What's wrong with you?"

"What do you mean?"

"Shirone. No matter how I think about it, it's strange that you're not saying anything."

"Then what should I say?"

"Let's say Shirone is what he is. But since the battle is over, there should be some mention. Are you really going to just collapse like this? Don't you need to reclaim the title of the kingdom's best student?"

Dante chuckled. It was a self-deprecating laugh.

"The kingdom's best student? Well..."

Frustrated by Dante's lukewarm response, Closer beat his chest.

He must have fallen into a serious slump.

The shock of losing to Shirone was so great that both his motivation and passion had disappeared.

"You really...!"

Just as the exasperated Closer was about to raise his voice, the cafeteria door opened and two people entered.

It happened to be Nade and Iruki.

The students' attention naturally focused in that direction.

It was a situation where the parties who had engaged in three weeks of fierce battle were reunited.

It was disappointing that Shirone wasn't visible, but on the other hand, they wondered what face he could show while walking around with his head held high.

All the students in the school had higher status than Shirone.

They were nobility, and Shirone was a commoner.

According to social norms, Shirone was someone who should lick their toes without complaint if told to do so.

Of course, as civilized people, they knew this wasn't particularly right, but they had no intention of giving up the advantages they had gained from birth.

Iruki, who was looking around due to the strange atmosphere in the cafeteria, spotted Dante.

Dante also met his eyes without avoiding them.

The students waited for the encounter between the two without even breathing, but contrary to expectations, the words Iruki uttered were bland.

"You're here? That's unusual. I thought you wouldn't visit places like the cafeteria."

Dante showed his coffee.

"I was thirsty. What about you?"

Iruki had peculiar tastes since childhood and wouldn't buy food unless it was something special. He believed it would impair brain function.

At the time, because he was young, his classmates looked at Iruki strangely, but Dante thought there was logic to it.

That's why, even after quite a long time had passed, he remembered Iruki's eating habits.

Iruki shrugged and walked to the vending machine.

"Shirone isn't eating dinner. I thought I'd buy him something."

Dante nodded as if he understood.

"I see. How is Shirone?"

"Well... just so-so. Though he seems a bit shocked."

"Really? That's unexpected."

Dante was sincere.

Through exchanging ultra-high-speed information in the Two Thousand Times battle, he had personally experienced how enormous the scale of Shirone's thinking was. He definitely didn't think Shirone was the type to shut himself in over something like this.

"Well... Shirone thinks terribly fondly of family. He seems angry that Killine took his parents' interview without permission."

Dante thought of Killine.

She was definitely capable of doing that and more.

If she knew the school had been turned upside down, his parents' guilt would be indescribable.

Shirone didn't like that, so he was probably waiting for this situation to pass as quickly as possible.

"Hey, Iruki, are you going to hang around with Shirone in this situation?"

James, one of the boys who had been badmouthing Shirone, jumped up and pointed at Iruki.

The mid-tier group wanted Dante and Shirone's factions to oppose each other. If the wasteful fighting continued to the end and they destroyed each other, it would create opportunities for them to rise up.

But when the expected collision didn't happen, they decided to directly provoke Iruki.

"If you're a Mercodyne, you're from the kingdom's greatest family. Don't you feel betrayed? Shirone is far below you but disguised himself as the same level. Yet you're running bread errands for that guy—does that make sense?"

Iruki waved his finger as if proud.

"Why doesn't it make sense? First, Shirone is my friend. And he's currently hungry. Most importantly, we already knew about Shirone's background. That's natural for friends, isn't it?"

"What, what?"

James gaped with a dumbfounded expression.

Since they were an inseparable trio who stuck together daily, there was a possibility Shirone had told them. But how could they continue being friends knowing that?
