Nade stepped forward. Though he enjoyed getting along with all students, he couldn't help but take Shirone's side when his friend was in this situation.

"You guys should stop now too. Sure, it might be shocking that Shirone is a commoner, but it's not like he deliberately deceived anyone. If you had asked, he would have answered honestly. That's just Shirone's personality. It's not good for students from the same school to attack each other over non-competitive matters."

"Competition? Don't talk nonsense. He's a commoner, a commoner! Do you make friends with commoners outside? No, you don't! You're in a position where countless commoners serve you at your family estate, so how can you possibly accept Shirone?"

Nade sighed.

Since they couldn't communicate, any attempt at persuasion would be futile.

Of course, there was some merit to James's words, and it wasn't that he couldn't understand their feelings.

But what could he do? Shirone was already his most precious friend, and he absolutely didn't want to see him sad.

James thought that Iruki and Nade were already blinded by their loyalty to Shirone and switched his target to Dante.

"Dante! You say something. You're the most upset person here. You suffered such humiliation at the hands of a mere commoner!"

Dante made an incredulous expression.

"I'm upset, but does it matter if someone's a commoner or noble? I lost, so I just lost."

For the first time, he had expressed his feelings about the duel, but even that was straightforward.

James finally realized how the situation was unfolding.

Both Dante's group and Shirone's group didn't want to get entangled with the middle-tier group.

It was as if they were avoiding reality, feeling that badmouthing Shirone would put them on the same level as himself.

James bowed his head and trembled before he couldn't hold back and lashed out.

"So that's what it was? You all want to suck up to Shirone, don't you? There's no one left in school who can beat Shirone now! You think taking Shirone's side makes you look incredibly impressive, right? You and I are no different. We're all just losers in the end!"

Dante stirred the ice in his iced coffee and said, "That went a bit too far. I'm the one who lost, so why are you getting so worked up?"

"Don't act so fake yourself! Honestly, you're so frustrated you can't stand it. After losing so miserably, how can you act like nothing happened? Tell me. You got beaten up by Shirone and even fainted. What exactly are you thinking as you live?"

"These guys have gone too far!"

Closer couldn't hold back and stepped forward. The kids who couldn't even make eye contact before Dante's defeat were now acting up with renewed confidence.

"Enough. Stop it."

Dante stopped Closer and looked up at the ceiling. After thinking for a long while, he slowly opened his mouth.

"What if... I had simplified the automaton's design a bit more?"

James's face contorted at the random comment.

"What? What kind of nonsense is that all of a sudden?"

"Pascal's circuits should have been more intuitive. For example, if it's attack then attack, if it's defense then defense - I should have distributed the roles like that. Wouldn't it have been better if there weren't too many types of basic magic? If I had operated only Wind Cutter without Fireball, mobility would have increased."

Students looked dazed at Dante's continuous stream of words.

Iruki and Nade listened seriously.

Certainly, if developed that way, the match dynamics would have changed somewhat.

Meanwhile, James kept his mouth firmly shut and trembled with anger.

Dante stood up with his coffee and approached him.

"If you ask what I'm thinking about, my head is full of nothing but thoughts about magic. Because I'm attending magic school. What about you - what are you thinking about as you live? Whether Shirone is a commoner or noble, what does that have to do with your magic?"

James's face turned red like a persimmon.

Shame washed over him like a tide, making him want to storm out and run away immediately.

But he couldn't show such disgrace in front of the underclassmen.

Having lost in logic, he now resorted to unreasonableness.

"Sh-shut up! What about you then? You didn't even kneel to Shirone. You made such a big fuss about preferring death or whatever, but you're still living just fine!"

Closer's eyes turned cold.

"James, do you want to die?"

James flinched in fear, but the words had already been spoken.

Besides, Closer was the one who had been beaten by Iruki, so he wouldn't be able to use force here.

"It's the truth! Tell me! Aren't you also someone whose outside doesn't match their inside?"

Dante was silent for a moment.

He wasn't particularly deep in thought. He was just waiting for Shirone's voice in his head to finish.

"That's..."

Dante said nonchalantly.

"I couldn't bring myself to die. Dying is scary, you know."

"What, what?"

Iruki burst into giggles.

He wasn't mocking Dante.

Of course dying is scary for everyone. As Shirone had said, it's simply because we're human.

He didn't like Dante, but he did like his automaton-like straightforward personality.

"I really did fight prepared to die, but when it came to this, I couldn't bring myself to die. That's all. But I also don't want to kneel."

James lost his reason.

He couldn't understand at all what either Dante's group or Shirone's group were thinking as they lived. In his eyes, they all looked like lunatics.

"Haha! Right, now I get it. You loser! In the end, you tucked your tail between your legs for Shirone. You were someone who never had the courage to die from the start! How about you hurry back to that prestigious Royal Magic School of yours?"

Closer seriously decided to beat James to a pulp.

Until now, he had been dispirited from the aftermath of defeat and felt awkward about beating someone up. But he couldn't just let slide someone who insulted Dante.

"Dante, don't stop me this time."

Closer cracked his knuckles as he approached James.

But once again, Dante stopped Closer.

"Forget it. This is also the fate of a loser. There's no way to prove it anyway."

Closer looked like he was going crazy with frustration.

"Dante..."

But Dante was truly okay.

James's noise was just that - noise. Words containing no meaning whatsoever.

Wasn't it because he disliked children who passionately argued about others' affairs without even having the leisure to reflect on themselves that he had quit school in his younger days?

Dante responded to the excited James with a smile.

"And James, I won't be going back to Royal Magic School. I'll continue attending Alpheas Magic School and graduate from here."

Closer's eyes widened in surprise, forgetting his earlier anger.

It was a sudden statement considering he hadn't said a word about his future plans.

Sabina asked in disbelief.

"Dante, really? Master Olivia hasn't even given a definitive answer about accepting the vice-principal position yet."

"It has nothing to do with Master. If Shirone is here, then naturally I should stay too."

Joy lit up in Closer's eyes.

"You mean you'll have a revenge match? Great! When will you do it?"

"That's not for me to decide. I already lost, so I don't want to be unreasonable about it. But I do have one chance left to make up for it. I can't transfer schools giving up that opportunity."

"Huh? A chance?"

Dante looked at Iruki and said.

"The graduation exam. It's a gateway that no magic school student can avoid. Of course, Shirone will take the graduation exam too."

Iruki nodded as if it were obvious.

"Of course."

Dante finally felt relieved.

There were still several variables to consider, but making the declaration following the flow of the situation actually felt refreshing.

As Shirone had said, he was just human. There was no need to obsess over trivial win rates.

Dante planned to start over from there.

"Closer, I'll take the graduation exam here. And I'll definitely beat Shirone and graduate first place."

Closer flexed his muscles and shouted heartily.

"Great! We'll definitely win this time! Let's start special training from today!"

Nade pulled Iruki over and said.

"Haha! Do you think you can get first place that easily? Do you think we'll just be playing around?"

Dante nodded as if acknowledging it.

Nade and Iruki - they too were indeed powerful rivals no less than Shirone.

"Yeah, come at me all you want. First place will be mine anyway."

Dante also spoke to James, who was standing there like a borrowed barley sack.

"You should also prepare hard. After all, you need to graduate to become a magician, right?"

James didn't answer. He just bowed his head deeply and left the store.

The students who had been badmouthing Shirone until now also glanced at each other and slipped out after him. With just Shirone's group being overwhelming enough, and now Dante's group competing in advanced class too, their future already looked bleak.

Dante threw his finished coffee in the trash and walked toward the door.

"We're leaving. Tell Shirone that I won't lose next time."

Iruki snorted and said.

"How about telling him directly?"

Dante stopped walking for a moment, looked up at the ceiling, and said.

"Well, that's fine too. Later when I have time."

Then he opened the door and left as if nothing had happened.

His cool personality of not taking anything too seriously seemed to be his nature.

Just then, the door suddenly opened again and Sabina entered.

She glared at Nade, chewing her lips, then strode over with determination.

Now that Dante had decided to make a comeback, she had to shake off her fear of Nade.

When Sabina widened her eyes, Nade pulled his neck back.

He knew she had been afraid of him since he had beaten her up. Of course, insulting the family was true, but he felt sorry for having imprinted the fear of death on her.

"N-next time we meet, I won't let you off."

He could imagine how much courage it took for Sabina to say these words.

Nade decided to forgive her.

He wasn't particularly interested in a magician's license, but he wanted fair competition until graduation.

Nade smiled and said.

"Yeah, let's have a proper match next time."

"Hmph."

Sabina blushed and fled the store as if running away. Her heart pounded with confidence that she had done it.

Iruki watched Sabina leave in a daze.

"What was that all of a sudden?"

Not knowing the whole story, he couldn't understand what their conversation meant.

Even Nade, who would normally step forward to explain, kept his mouth shut.

"What is it? What happened? Are you... kind of like that with Sabina?"

Nade waved his hands in alarm.

"No! Sabina is... Ah, I don't know. There's just something like that."

When it seemed he didn't want to talk about it, Iruki didn't press further.

Whatever relationship Sabina and Nade had was their own business.

Of course, personally he wanted to actively support it. He didn't like Sabina, but if she could drive out the specter that had taken root in Nade's heart, that would be fine.

"Right. Anyway, let's hurry and buy something to take back. Shirone is waiting."

Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society.

In the research room after his friends had left, Shirone was lost in thought.

On the sofa was a Spirit magazine that Nade had brought, and Shirone's gaze remained fixed on the page with his parents' interview article.

"Sigh, why..."

Shirone couldn't believe what had just happened.

Of course, he wasn't ashamed of being a commoner's son, and he was proud to be his parents' son.

But now Shirone was old enough to understand the ways of the world to some extent.

Since there were many friends with clear judgment at magic school, he hadn't faced any particular crisis until now, but the world's perspective would be different.

He wanted to see his parents. What kind of feelings were they having right now?

Father would probably know that it wouldn't be good if his son's status was revealed.

How exactly had Killine made them confess?

If coercive methods were involved, he wouldn't be able to forgive her.

'I hope Mother wasn't hurt.'

Since it was published in a magazine distributed throughout the entire kingdom, it seemed like a leave of absence application would be approved if he submitted it even now.

Above all, Principal Alpheas would think of it as his own problem.
