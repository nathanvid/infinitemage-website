But Shirone shook his head.

Less than a month remained until the end of the semester.

The practical exams had passed, and only the theoretical exams were left.

Since he would enter the graduating class next semester, if not now, there would be no time to reinforce his fundamentals.

That was the rational judgment, but his emotions wouldn't move as his thoughts dictated.

Though Shirone was usually unshakeable by any circumstance, with his parents involved, there was no way books could catch his eye.

That was also why he came straight to the research society after classes ended, endlessly lost in distracting thoughts.

Nade opened the door to the research society and entered.

"Hey, Shirone, we're here."

Iruki placed a bag containing bread on the table and sat across from Shirone on the sofa.

"I brought some food. You must be hungry, so eat if you feel like it."

"Yeah, thanks."

"We ran into Dante at the store."

"Really? How was he?"

"How else? He was really fired up. Looks like he's staying at school. He says he'll definitely beat you in the graduation exam and graduate as first place. I told him to tell you directly. He said he'll make a declaration of war soon, so you should think up some good comeback lines in advance."

Even in his troubled state, Shirone burst into laughter.

That was definitely thorough Iruki. Now that Dante's group had emerged as competitors, he was already in full battle mode.

"Alright, I'll think of something. You're making me laugh."

At the words "you're making me laugh," Iruki smiled bitterly. Even though he didn't show it, his heart was clearly troubled.

Nade, who had been wondering if there was any way to make Shirone feel even a little better, remembered a certain rumor and spoke up.

"I heard today that Principal Olivia called for Killine. She'll probably come up with some countermeasure. Don't worry too much."

"I see..."

Shirone had also heard rumors that Olivia might remain at the school.

But with the situation already having erupted, it was uncertain how much help she could provide.

The most frustrating thing was that there was nothing he could do.

Since rumors had no substance, you couldn't fight and win against them, nor could you put handcuffs on them and throw them in jail.

All Shirone could do was hope that this storm would pass safely without causing any incidents.

@

Killine, who had received the summons, caught a carriage that night and arrived in Creas.

Since Olivia held the inspector position, which was among the highest ranks in the teachers' council, a clumsy response would cause trouble.

Killine, who had packed only basic travel clothes, found a random inn to sleep in and headed to Alpheas Magic School from the morning.

Students who recognized her whispered among themselves.

The article interviewing Shirone's parents had definitely caused an uproar. Also, regardless of what feelings they had toward Shirone, no student would view her favorably.

Killine thought today's schedule wouldn't be easy.

'It doesn't matter. I was prepared for this anyway.'

By revealing Shirone's background, Dante's star power was maintained.

Not only had she beaten other correspondents who were wandering around looking for new stars, but she could also continue her livelihood as before.

Olivia would also want Dante to succeed.

Given her social position, she wouldn't condone sensational articles, but she would just deliver a few words of admonishment and wrap things up.

Killine straightened her clothes and stood in front of the principal's office. She cleared her throat with a cough and reported in her characteristically bright voice.

"It's Killine."

"Please come in."

Olivia's voice was the part that Killine, as a correspondent, envied most.

If God would allow it, she would choose her voice over even the position of a Second-Class Great Magician.

But today, she felt uneasy.

As an authority on incantation magic, her voice had a special power to pierce human hearts.

From what she could hear, it definitely wasn't a good emotion.

When she entered the principal's office, Olivia sat with a cold expression. Unusually, former Principal Alpheas was also seated beside her, and across from them sat Shirone.

"Hello, Olivia, Alpheas. Oh, and hello to you too, Shirone?"

Killine greeted all three people cheerfully, making eye contact with each.

No one responded. Particularly, Olivia didn't even tell her to sit down.

"This article... can you explain it?"

Olivia threw a magazine at Killine's feet.

It couldn't feel good to have a magazine containing your own article fall to the floor.

But Killine didn't show it. The atmosphere was much worse than expected.

"Conveying facts is both the job and calling of a correspondent. Is there some problem?"

Shirone's brow furrowed.

While correspondents had a duty to convey facts, they weren't the only ones in this world qualified to pursue precious values.

Even if clear lines couldn't be drawn, if there was a duty to fulfill one's calling, there were also responsibilities to uphold.

Killine held her head high as if she had nothing to be ashamed of and withstood the gazes of the three people.

How many times had she experienced this kind of pressure while covering aspiring magicians?

High-ranking nobles had lobbied for her to write favorable articles, and sometimes unknown gangs had attacked and trashed her home.

She had overcome all those hardships to reach this position.

Moreover, Olivia knew these circumstances better than anyone.

Having overcome threats from numerous competitors to make Dante a star, there was nothing she could do to her.

"Of course, I expected that Shirone's interview would cause social ripples. But Olivia, it was unavoidable. I merely transcribed what was said in the interview. It's not my fault that Shirone's background is different from others."

Olivia smiled coldly.

Was that the end of it? Killine truly thought so.

But her smile disappeared in an instant.

"You've grown up a lot, Killine."

Killine's face hardened.

"When you first joined the teachers' council, you were just a kid who couldn't even speak to me. Now you've gone beyond holding your own to trying word games..."

Killine sensed the situation was turning strange, but she was also fighting for her livelihood.

Rather than see ten years of career turn to nothing, she'd rather die right here.

"Hehe, was that so? It was so long ago I don't remember well. Come to think of it, that means you've aged that much too, Olivia. You never would have used such uncouth language before. The ways of the world are truly frightening."

Olivia and Killine's gazes collided head-on.

Alpheas, unable to bear it, opened his mouth.

"Ms. Killine, no matter how important an article is, when it comes to recording someone's life, there's a responsibility..."

"You stay quiet."

Olivia cut him off.

What a frustrating old fool. Did he think he could persuade Killine, who was so venomous, with personality theory?

Using informal speech in an official setting was also a performance to pressure Killine.

Alpheas awkwardly closed his mouth, but the effect was significant.

Killine still maintained her smile, but her face had turned pale as paper.

"Are you crazy, Killine?"

Killine couldn't breathe. Conversely, her heart was madly pumping oxygen throughout her body.

Even a child would know that if Olivia seriously intended to crush her, she wouldn't stand a chance.

She didn't understand why Olivia was treating her so harshly.

This was also for Dante's sake, and it was true that she had tacitly agreed in such situations until now.

"I apologize if I was rude. But Olivia, this was unavoidable. Even if you're in charge of inspections for the teachers' council, you can't exert external pressure on articles. If this fact comes to light, I won't be the one in trouble."

Killine's words had some merit.

No one in the teachers' council had the authority to modify factually legitimate content written by a correspondent from the publication department.

The exceptions would be if the royal family declared martial law or if illegal corruption was revealed in the article-writing process.

"No, Killine. The one whose correspondent career is ending is you. Shirone's parents' interview—exactly how did you get it? From what Shirone says, his parents are absolutely not the type to carelessly divulge such matters."

Killine flinched slightly.

Honestly, she hadn't expected Olivia to pursue her so tenaciously, so she had been somewhat relaxed about that matter.

Of course, she hadn't used threats or created a coercive atmosphere. She had just slightly exploited the hearts of parents worried about their child.

"Well... they told me after I kept asking. They must have been nervous when I said it was an interview. There are many people like that."

Olivia smiled incredulously.

"Killine, don't I know you?"

Killine pressed her lips tightly together and glared at Olivia resentfully.

Olivia knew her interview methods down to the bone. They had worked together for ten years to make Dante a star.

That's why it was even more unfair. When she deserved recognition for her contributions, they called her in to pressure her, making her want to cry.

"Since they're commoners blinded by the magic world, emphasizing just one thing would have been enough. The teachers' council. You sold the authority of the teachers' council by exploiting the fact that Shirone was a student, right? From the parents' perspective, they naturally had no choice but to agree. They would think that a student marked by the teachers' council would be finished."

Shirone's eyes sharpened with intensity.

If she had really pressured his parents that way, it was absolutely unforgivable.

Killine felt like a rat cornered in a dead-end alley. Olivia had definitely decided to catch her today.

But she still had one more weapon left.

Self-destruction.

Removing her mask of pretense, she tearfully showed a pitiful expression.

"Yes, I did that. But so what? You know too, Olivia. Everyone does it that way. If you can't even do that much, you can't write articles."

Killine's words contained an unspoken threat. Hadn't Dante been handled the same way?

But Olivia didn't even bat an eyelash.

Of course, if they dug deep, Olivia would have some faults too.

But thinking she was on the same level as Killine was a mistake from the start—she was an inspector of the teachers' council, a Second-Class Great Magician of the Red Line.

"Killine, I'm not blaming you as a correspondent. I'm trying to punish you for betraying me after I trusted you for so long."

Killine felt her heart sink.

It was a challenge—let's see who survives when we tear at each other.

If it were someone like Alpheas, there would be nothing to fear.

But Olivia was worldly-wise and had somewhat materialistic tendencies.

If such a person was born with genius-level intelligence, Killine never had a chance from the beginning.

"What did I betray? I'll be honest with you. I thought you'd like it, Olivia. Dante lost. I just wanted your student to succeed."

Only then did Olivia relax her expression.

Having stripped away every layer of Killine's pretense, now they could have a true conversation.

"I appreciate the thought, but it's presumptuous. And it wasn't for me, but for yourself. Without Dante, your position in the teachers' council would be shaken too. But not me. Dante lost, but Shirone won. Since Shirone is also my student, I have nothing to lose."

"What? What did you say?"

Killine looked bewildered.

Why was Shirone her student?

She looked back at Alpheas, but he also wore a blank expression as if he didn't understand.

"Shirone is your student? Olivia, you're temporary staff. I understood you were quitting the principal position soon."

"I was going to, but I changed my mind. I'm staying at Alpheas Magic School. From next semester, I'll take the position of vice-principal. So you become a traitor who schemed to ruin my student's future."

Killine still couldn't understand her words and rolled her eyes in confusion.
