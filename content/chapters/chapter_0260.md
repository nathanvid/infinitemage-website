She had been the principal of the Royal Magic School ten years ago, yet now she was entering as a vice-principal of a regional school.

She wasn't the type to lie in front of a correspondent, so it must be true.

But why on earth? Why would she make a choice that would instantly destroy a career she had built through lifelong success?

What could possibly be at this school?

Alpheas also felt suspicious.

Although they had recently reconciled their past grievances and grown closer, she had been reluctant about taking the vice-principal position until the very end.

"Olivia. You..."

"Just stay quiet for a moment. We can talk about that later."

When Olivia looked at him with an exasperated expression, Alpheas quickly shut his mouth.

Meanwhile, Killine's eyes moved rapidly. Calculations of gains and losses raced through her mind.

A trivial mistake had caused this situation. No, could this really be called a mistake?

It was just Olivia's whim.

But if a Second-Class Great Magician had thrown a tantrum, she had no choice but to accommodate it.

Killine hastily fell to her knees and prostrated herself on the floor.

"I'm sorry! I made a mistake without knowing my place. I should have given advance notice, but I didn't know Ms. Olivia felt that way and I just..."

She had no choice but to beg unconditionally.

When Olivia could rationally crush someone, she became the most terrifying being in the world.

Hundreds of her disciples sat in leadership positions across all sectors of society. With just a word from her, she could not only prevent Killine from setting foot in the teachers' council, but could have her permanently expelled from society.

"I'll immediately publish a correction article. Please give me one last chance! I'll somehow resolve this situation."

Olivia let out a long sigh.

If it were that easy to resolve, she wouldn't have created this atmosphere in the first place.

The magazine had already spread throughout the world, and it was impossible to retrieve it all. Even if they could retrieve it, they couldn't erase people's memories.

"Publishing a correction article would only make the incident bigger. Don't create unnecessary issues."

"Then what should I do?"

Killine looked up with tears streaming down her face.

She who had entered with her head held high had become a rookie correspondent fresh to the teachers' council in just ten minutes.

"Run special feature articles for two months. Divert attention with sensational articles about corruption at various schools, teachers sexually harassing students, and organ trafficking happening on the front lines of magic society. I'll give you the sources. Shirone and Dante's names must never appear in the magazine."

"Yes, yes, I'll do that."

"And... apologize to Shirone."

Killine turned to look at Shirone while still on her knees.

Shirone's face clearly displayed his complex emotions.

He was truly angry, but seeing Killine fighting and then yielding to protect her livelihood made him feel sorry for her too.

It was probably because she was an adult. This was an adult's life where one mistake could end everything.

"I'm sorry. I'll do whatever compensation I can, so please give me one more chance..."

Shirone didn't want to hear it.

He wanted to shout that she shouldn't have caused trouble in the first place, but that would also be pointless.

An adult fifteen years older than him crawling on her knees and pressing her head to the ground was so uncomfortable he couldn't even look.

"It's fine. Just go. It's already in the past. There's no way to undo it. But if there's a chance later, I'd appreciate it if you could apologize to my parents."

"Yes, I'll visit them immediately. I'm truly sorry."

Olivia smiled bitterly.

Any student would be similar, but Shirone was particularly straightforward. A more cunning child wouldn't have dismissed Killine like this.

'Well, he's a child completely removed from desires for honor or material things.'

The characteristic of those who had realized the Immortal Function was that their thinking was metaphysical. They had an extreme lack of thirst for worldly things, pursued ideals, and showed deep interest in worlds beyond imagination.

Regardless of Shirone's inclinations, Olivia didn't want to dismiss Killine.

Even in a monarchical state, the power of the press couldn't be ignored, and she was clever.

Moreover, since she had a high reputation in correspondent circles, it was much more advantageous to keep her close and protect her rather than raise a new correspondent.

"Killine, you are a capable child. Make sure this mistake never happens again. When this is over, let's have a meal together."

"Thank you! There will absolutely never be such an incident again!"

"Good, go now."

Killine repeatedly bowed her head as she backed away.

With this resolution, Alpheas and Shirone had nothing particular to say.

They had chosen the best solution available in the current situation, and Killine had also tasted the feeling of falling into hell, so their hearts were somewhat appeased.

Olivia turned to Shirone and said:

"I'm sorry. It's my oversight. Of course, strictly speaking, it's this old man's oversight."

Alpheas covered his mouth and coughed awkwardly, looking embarrassed.

Shirone forced a smile.

This didn't resolve all his emotions, but for him who had nowhere to rely, the presence of Olivia and Alpheas was a solid support.

Alpheas comforted Shirone.

"This too shall pass quickly. The final exams are coming soon, so don't think about anything else and focus on the tests. Everything will return to normal."

"Yes, thank you. I'll be going now."

Shirone expressed his sincere gratitude and left the principal's office.

Though all the main characters of this incident had disappeared, tension still lingered in the principal's office.

Olivia closed her eyes and fell into thought. Then she looked at Alpheas and asked:

"Do you really think so?"

Alpheas had no answer.

If it were a moderately serious matter, time would be the medicine. But Shirone's case was different.

What they were thinking about wasn't problems like Shirone's humble origins or his lack of qualifications to attend magic school.

"We have no choice but to watch. Perhaps... nothing might happen at all."

"That would be nice. But..."

Olivia stopped speaking.

As Alpheas said, talking about it now wouldn't change anything. She could only hope that the terrifying bomb hidden in this incident would never surface.

The final exams were over.

Last semester, vacation began immediately after exams, but in the second half there was one more schedule.

The graduating class's graduation examination.

As it was the magic school's biggest festival that all students attended, the atmosphere within the school was lively.

Shirone's final exam results placed him 6th in Class Four.

Dante was first, followed by Sabina, Closer, Boyle, and Pandora in order.

Below Shirone were Iruki and Nade.

Shirone was satisfied, having tremendously strengthened his biggest weakness, omniscience, in just one year. On the other hand, Iruki and Nade seemed shocked at falling behind in the theoretical exam and were dazed for a while.

When combined with practical exam scores for the total points, Shirone's ranking was an impressive 3rd place.

Dante was overall 1st, followed by Iruki.

In any case, since he had defeated the overall 1st place Dante in the 2000-match tournament, many students supported Shirone as the top graduation candidate by a narrow margin.

However, his reputation wasn't what it used to be.

Due to his origins being revealed, the children who had followed Shirone gradually distanced themselves one by one.

Some even openly spoke disparagingly to Shirone.

Shirone felt hurt each time, but didn't show it.

Killine kept her promise and no longer published articles in Spirit magazine.

According to what he heard from Olivia, she had visited his parents to kneel and beg for forgiveness.

Since everyone falls into a swamp at least once in their lives, Shirone thought of this too as passing wind.

Perhaps it could have ended that way.

But the article about Shirone that appeared just once in Spirit magazine returned as a massive aftermath that transcended everyone's expectations.

Fifteen days before the graduation exam, an incident occurred that shook the magic school.

Clank! Clank!

Forty knights in full armor passed through the noble district of Tormia. They were soldiers escorting a single carriage.

The carriage decorated with golden crowns was massive enough to eat, sleep, and live inside.

Even distinguished nobles didn't dare frown at the armed procession occupying the road.

Naturally, the guards protecting the school's main gate were scared out of their wits.

When the carriage stopped at the main gate, the school's security system fell into chaos.

The head of security came running in a panic, read the document handed by the lead knight, and became even paler than when he'd arrived as he ran to the principal's office.

"Principal! This is terrible!"

The head of security opened the principal's office door immediately after knocking.

Olivia's expression soured as she disliked people with no manners.

But seeing the nearly fifty-year-old head of security with a face ready to cry, she set aside her emotions for the moment.

"What's the matter?"

"Well, someone came to see... no, please look at this!"

Instead of explaining verbally, the head of security placed the document on the desk.

Olivia picked up the document and read it carefully, more out of curiosity than tension.

"Hah..."

Olivia put the document back down and sighed while pressing her forehead.

"What, what should we do? Should I let them in?"

"Of course we should. How could we turn them away? Guide them this way. I'll come out to greet them as soon as I'm ready."

"Understood!"

The head of security skipped even basic courtesy and ran off frantically.

Olivia considered following to give him a scolding, but she could understand his state of mind. His legs were probably weak and his mind completely blank.

"Finally... the situation has exploded."

Olivia leaned her elbow on the desk and rested her chin in her hand.

The feared event had finally occurred, but she hadn't expected such a formidable opponent.

'Well... they couldn't help but move. After seeing that article.'

Perhaps this was actually good for Shirone?

Given his personality, he might be disgusted, but considering his future and life, it was certainly close to a blessing.

"Anyway... I should go out."

Olivia quickly changed clothes and left the principal's office.

When the house-sized carriage crossed the courtyard, students stopped walking and stared.

Not only was the carriage's scale amazing, but it was the first time armed soldiers with military equipment had entered the school.

"What's that? What's happening?"

"Did a war break out somewhere? Why are knights coming into the school?"

Murmuring sounds came from everywhere, but the knights didn't even glance as they walked.

Finally, the carriage stopped at the central building of the school.

The knights placed their hands on their sword hilts as if ready to draw at any suspicious sign, watching their surroundings.

Students who heard the rumors gathered one by one. Eventually, hundreds of people filled the area around the carriage.

Even so, the carriage remained motionless, nailed to that spot.

Alpheas, who received word from Olivia, came out to greet them first.

But even though the school's former principal appeared, the knights didn't lower their guard.

"Principal, what is this about? Did something happen at the school?"

Alpheas couldn't tell his students anything.

Even after receiving word from Olivia, he had been skeptical, but seeing it with his own eyes, the situation exceeded expectations.

On top of the carriage decorated with golden crowns stood a lion statue carved in gold.

There was only one country on the continent that used the lion as its symbol.

Since Alpheas had just arrived, he hadn't heard the detailed circumstances, but if they had come, the reason was obvious.

Shirone.

The mistake Killine had made had finally led to this situation.

'No, should this be called a situation? Perhaps for Shirone...'

At that moment, the carriage door burst open and an elderly man with fierce eyes stepped down. When the knights cleared a path left and right, he walked forward with his mouth stubbornly clenched.

Though his gait was unsteady with age, the venom in his face was no ordinary impression.

Breaking away from the knights' escort, he looked around at the gathered students, then with a stern and arrogant expression, pulled out a scroll from his chest.

The scroll was also made of the finest paper and edged with gold.

"I am Ordos, administrative executive of the Kingdom of Kasula and envoy traveling under the king's command!"
