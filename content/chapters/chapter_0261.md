The students unconsciously stepped backward.

The voice of the old man, who looked ready to enter a coffin any day now, was louder than even a young man's shout.

But once they grasped the meaning behind the old man's words, that much was hardly surprising at all.

The Kingdom of Kasula was a nation located to the north of the Kingdom of Tormia.

What business would an administrative executive following the king's orders have coming to a provincial school rather than the Royal Magic School?

The students' questions were resolved by Ordos's next words.

"Is Arian Shirone present here! If so, come forward immediately and receive the king's command!"

The students searched for Shirone as if it were their duty, looking everywhere without exception.

But Shirone was nowhere to be seen.

Only after the confusion subsided did strange thoughts arise. Why would an envoy from the Kingdom of Kasula be looking for Shirone?

Alpheas looked at a student beside him and said.

"Would you go and call Shirone? It seems to be urgent business."

"Yes? Oh, yes!"

The student hurriedly dashed off to find Shirone.

Of course, there was no way to know where he was, and finding him on this vast campus was nearly impossible. But the situation was so urgent that they had to start moving their legs first.

"Arian Shirone! Is Shirone not present here? This is the king's command! Come out quickly and receive the command!"

Ordos roared angrily about whatever was displeasing him.

Of course, if he was an envoy from the Kingdom of Kasula, then he was in a position to carry out the king's orders, making him untouchable by anyone present.

No matter how renowned Alpheas was in magical society, it was merely a position granted by the state. No organization could take priority over the nation.

But since this was tantamount to a foreign king directly intervening, the noble students who had read imperial theory until it was worn thin couldn't make a peep.

"Shirone! Why don't you come out quickly!"

"I've brought Shirone."

A beautiful voice cut through Ordos's metallic screech.

Olivia, the current headmaster of Alpheas Magic School, walked over holding Shirone's hand.

Since he always visited the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society after classes ended, finding him wasn't difficult.

Iruki and Nade followed behind.

Shirone looked around with a bewildered expression.

Nearly the entire student body was gathered, and in front stood guards who clearly looked formidable just by sight, along with a large carriage.

All Olivia had told him on the way was that someone was looking for him.

"Shirone, go see that person. He's an envoy from the Kingdom of Kasula."

"What? An envoy?"

Only then did Shirone look up at Olivia in shock.

Though Shirone now trusted her as much as she had cared for him when Killine was causing trouble, hearing about a royal envoy made him inevitably anxious.

Olivia gently patted his back.

"It's alright. You'll understand when you go see."

Because he trusted Olivia, Shirone took a deep breath and walked toward Ordos.

Ordos glared at Shirone with sunken eyes.

They were clearly sunken eyes, but it felt like his brain was being pierced through. The moment he thought he wouldn't be able to tell any lies, Ordos asked in his characteristic metallic voice.

"Are you Arian Shirone?"

"Yes, that's correct."

"Lying in this place would be insulting to the Kingdom of Kasula! I'll ask once more! Are you certain that you are Arian Shirone!"

"Yes! I'm certain!"

Shirone found himself shouting without realizing it.

He couldn't understand why they had to shout so much even when conversing at close range, but it was certainly effective.

His mind went blank as answers automatically burst out as if he were under hypnosis.

Ordos extended his hand to the deputy standing behind him.

When the deputy handed him a scroll bearing the royal seal, Ordos unrolled it, arrogantly raised his head, and shouted.

"Arian Shirone! Before conveying the king's command, I will ask several questions. Know that if you lie or commit perjury, your life may be in danger! Do you understand!"

"Yes, I understand."

Though Shirone didn't like Ordos's attitude of threatening his life after calling him forward, since it was said to be the king's command, he had no choice but to comply.

Of course, since he hadn't lived a life of crime, there was nothing to worry about.

"Arian Shirone. Are you the son of a mountain man living halfway up Dawn Valley, Arian Shirone?"

"Yes, that's correct."

"Are you Shirone, the child that Arian Vincent and Arian Olina picked up from a stable?"

Commoners don't particularly have meaningful surnames.

The fact that Vincent and Olina shared the same surname was because they were of Arian ethnicity. Though not widely known as they were a minority group, any ethnologist would immediately recognize them as commoners upon hearing it.

In the end, Ordos's words contained not an ounce of consideration for Shirone.

Even without adding that he was a child picked up from a stable, the fact that Shirone was a commoner was already known throughout the kingdom.

"Yes, that's correct."

Shirone answered with a sigh.

He could feel the students' disgusted gazes, but he had already prepared himself for this.

However, Ordos persistently emphasized only the negative aspects, as if he couldn't bear not giving Shirone shame.

"You were raised by the hunter Vincent, who lives in the Thorn Mine region located halfway up the Origin Mountains, from when you were 2 months old. You were abandoned at a stable. From then on, you learned hunting skills following your father. Later, you entered the Ozent family as a servant and worked for 2 years, then became their guest and entered magic school. Is everything up to this point true?"

Someone among the students burst into laughter.

"Puhahaha! A servant!"

The laughter immediately disappeared when everyone's attention focused on them, but the other students were surely laughing inside as well.

A servant in a noble family was someone who scrubbed floors.

Nade looked around trying to remember the face of the student who had just laughed.

Iruki also frowned, seemingly offended by Ordos's words.

Shirone sighed once again.

When he first stepped forward, he had been flustered, but by now he understood his situation anew.

Everyone was mocking him.

It was terrible that friends who had been laughing and chatting with him until recently were now looking at him like he was an insect.

"Answer, Shirone! Is all of this true?"

"Yes, it's true..."

As soon as Shirone finished speaking, the students began murmuring.

Most of it was disparagement and mockery, with only a few looking at Shirone with pity.

Canis and Arin, who were listening from far away from the crowd, were among those few.

"How unexpected. To think Shirone was a commoner."

"Hmph, so what? Nobles are just unlucky anyway. All they know how to do is flaunt their family names."

Both Canis and Arin were parentless. Having been abandoned on the streets as children and spent their youth in Radum, the capital's underworld, they couldn't help but despise the nobles mocking Shirone.

"But there are some who aren't like that. Iruki and Nade too, and Dante's group also looks upset. Dante especially is surprising. I thought he would dislike Shirone."

Since Arin had the ability of foresight, it was probably true.

Canis glanced at Dante with displeasure, then spat out words as if it didn't matter.

"Tch, what would origin matter to people crazy about magic? If they're aspiring mages, that's normal. No, that's annoying too. Acting sympathetic when they were born with silver spoons?"

Arin smiled slightly.

While Shirone at least had the title of commoner, they were just rootless bastards. Despite his harsh words, Canis was clearly also moved by Dante's attitude of judging people solely by magic.

"Look... Amy's coming too."

Where Arin pointed, two women were running over breathlessly. It was Amy and her close friend Seriel.

"Amy, what on earth is going on?"

Seriel was breathing heavily but couldn't keep her mouth still for a moment.

The student who received Alpheas's request had first sought out Amy, known as Shirone's girlfriend.

Of course, Seriel, who was by her side, couldn't possibly not accompany her to such an incredible situation.

"I don't know! We'll find out when we go see."

Amy and Seriel pushed through the crowd of students.

Since Shirone's official girlfriend had appeared, the students made way without complaint.

"Shirone! What is this...!"

Amy, who had pushed through the crowd, hastily swallowed her words.

Numerous knights were watching all directions with murderous eyes, and a cantankerous old man was shouting angrily.

Shirone was slightly bowing his head and listening attentively to the old man's words, looking like someone who had committed a crime and was awaiting judgment.

Ordos's degradation of Shirone reached its peak.

He began recounting stories from magazines, and when that ended, he listed private anecdotes collected through his own channels.

Not only his time with the children of the slash-and-burn village, but even tales of wandering the mountains for days to obtain a single meal.

From the students' perspective, everything was new and absurd. And precisely because of that, the fact that Shirone was a commoner hit home even more.

The scroll Ordos held would only contain the king's orders.

At this point, Ordos's effort to memorize all the details spanning 18 years was almost admirable.

Shirone, the person in question, was in a state of mental confusion.

Having all his secret stories exposed in front of friends he had lived with for a year felt more miserable than being naked.

"Is all of this true? Answer, Shirone."

Shirone was so agitated that he didn't even realize he was clenching his fists. When he came to his senses, he was on the verge of exploding.

Hastily calming his mind, he nodded as if resigned.

"Yes, it's correct."

The students burst into laughter.

As the absurd barrage of questions continued, no one bothered to be considerate anymore.

Actually, the stories weren't even that funny. But for those raised in noble families, the past of Shirone, the top student in the advanced class, couldn't be more amusing.

Seriel looked at Amy with concern.

Of course, she too had first learned about Shirone being a commoner through the magazine.

Honestly, it was shocking. She was also hurt that Amy hadn't told her such an important fact.

But Seriel decided to choose the side that would make her happy.

To hate Amy and Shirone would mean all the precious experiences they had shared together were too valuable to discard.

But other students had no such memories.

To them, Shirone was nothing more than an untouchable genius and an obstacle they hoped would disappear from their lives through some misfortune.

"Amy..."

Amy finally exploded.

"Those bastards! What's so funny that they're laughing?"

Amy rolled up her sleeves and walked toward the students.

She was also angry at Shirone's friends who were just watching this situation unfold.

At that moment, Ordos delivered the king's command.

"Arian Shirone, kneel and receive the command!"

Amy's steps stopped, and Shirone knelt on one knee and listened to the message.

Ordos shouted as if everything until now had been a whisper, his voice threatening to tear.

It really seemed like it might tear.

"King Orcamp IV of Kasula commands! Since all of Arian Shirone's background matches what was heard in the Kingdom of Kasula, there is a strong possibility that you are the First Prince who fled during the kingdom's crisis 18 years ago! Therefore, we invite you to the kingdom, so readily respond to the call and prove your qualifications as the First Prince yourself! That is all! Orcamp IV!"

Iruki and Nade shouted simultaneously.

"Whaaaaaaat!"

The shock other students received was similar.

When the envoy from a foreign country came and questioned Shirone's past in detail, they thought it was simply a recruitment offer.

Though very rare, depending on each country's circumstances, they sometimes recruit talent from other nations.

But for Shirone to be royalty. And not just any royalty, but the First Prince, who could be called the direct bloodline of the royal family.
