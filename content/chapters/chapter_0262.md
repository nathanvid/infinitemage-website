The students who had gossiped about Shirone whispered among themselves with pale faces.

"How did this happen? Why is Shirone...?"

"I don't know. The First Prince? And of the Kingdom of Kasula?"

"Well, I guess someone with Shirone's level of talent couldn't be an ordinary commoner."

Everyone fell silent as mute as honey-fed mutes at someone's pointed words.

When they thought about it, it was the right answer.

There was no guarantee that a genius couldn't be born from a commoner's family, but talent had strong genetic components. Most of the students had also inherited their genius from their parents.

They finally realized what they had been overlooking.

Just because Shirone grew up in a commoner's household didn't guarantee his bloodline was also common.

No, if his birth parents had been commoners, they wouldn't have been able to sneak deep into the mountains and abandon a child there.

"Hey, what do we do now? The Kingdom of Kasula is an allied nation with our kingdom, right? Is Shirone really going to become the king of Kasula? What if he tries to harm us?"

"Y-you fool! It's not certain yet! There's no need to panic prematurely."

"Not certain? Do you really think the kingdom would make such a grand announcement without any investigation? What we heard isn't everything. They must have investigated thoroughly and gained confidence, which is why Kasula sent an envoy."

There was certainly a high probability of that.

This wasn't just anywhere, but a kingdomâ€”and a letter sent directly by the king himself. If Shirone wasn't his son, it would be a national disgrace.

Yet the fact that they had made such a public announcement was evidence that the leadership was already more than 99% certain.

"I don't know! Damn it! We're all screwed!"

Nade felt satisfied watching his friends make miserable faces.

Of course, even if Shirone became king, he wasn't the type to harm them.

No, if he really became king, unless he was pettier than a grain of millet, he wouldn't even bother with them.

But from the perspective of those being targeted, it was human nature to feel uneasy.

Even first-class nobles were beings who lived off the state's patronage.

While supranational families existed globally, most were merely subjects of kings.

In such circumstances, with Shirone positioned to become royalty, it was natural for students to feel their necks prickling and their hearts heavy.

"Answer quickly, Shirone! This is the king's command!"

When Shirone didn't give a definite answer, Ordos shouted again.

But Shirone truly didn't know what decision to make.

He had only dueled with Dante.

That had been reported by Killine's pen and spread throughout the kingdom.

Shirone's expectations had ended there.

He never imagined his birth parents would encounter that article and seek him out.

Moreover, if those birth parents were not just nobles but royalty, it would be strange if his mind didn't go numb.

Shirone looked around, searching for someone to explain the current situation.

Most students wore dumbfounded expressions, and even Nade and Iruki had no advice to offer.

When birth parents wanted to find their child, what could friends say? It was a matter of blood, and moreover, it involved royalty.

Alpheas looked at Olivia.

He had thought Killine's article would bring aftershocks, but this was a much bigger fish than expected.

"The Kingdom of Kasula. This is the biggest catch among all the candidates so far."

"The credibility would be that much higher too. From what I've seen, Shirone's talent is extraordinary. I thought it was possible that his real parents might find him after reading the article, but I never imagined they would be royalty..."

Though they hadn't told Shirone, several families had secretly requested information about Shirone after Killine's article was published.

Due to the frequent political marriages among nobles, there were surprisingly many illegitimate children.

Most didn't care about abandoned children, but if it was the kingdom's greatest talent, that was a different story.

Even if there were some inconsistencies, it was the arrogance of nobles to be convinced the child was theirs.

"Kyaa! This can't be! Shirone was a prince! This is exactly like the story I imagined! Amy, can you see I have goosebumps? Look at this!"

Seriel was already off in another world.

Shirone was a prince.

Wasn't this the kind of romance that couldn't be replaced by books?

"Huh? Then that means..."

Seriel suddenly realized something and looked at Amy with a surprised expression.

"Amy! You're going to become a queen?"

"Shut up! What are you saying?"

Amy silenced her with a fierce look.

In an already complicated situation, Seriel's chatter was almost at the level of noise.

Anyway, whether Shirone was royalty or not didn't matter. She was only worried about Shirone, who was confused about meeting his birth parents.

Shirone made eye contact with Amy.

Seeing Shirone's expression that looked like he might cry, Amy also sent him a sympathetic look.

It was the king's command, so there was no choice but to follow it.

Shirone knew this fact too. He just wanted to have confidence that his choice was right.

Amy nodded at him.

Shirone looked intently at Amy as if asking again, and only after seeing Amy's smile did he turn his head to Ordos.

"Yes, I will accept the king's summons."

Ordos approached Shirone as if it was natural that he should.

"Royal protocol is different from noble protocol. Especially the Kingdom of Kasula's protocol is strict, so you must be careful with your conduct. After filing for a leave of absence from school, bring the parents who raised you."

"What? Right now?"

"What's the use of talking? It's the king's command! The sooner you leave, the better!"

Shirone's vision went dark.

He had never even heard of the Kingdom of Kasula's protocol, and suddenly having to take a leave of absence from school and return home was equally frustrating.

Most of all, he hadn't heard anything about what procedures awaited him once he entered the kingdom.

Even if he asked, they wouldn't tell him, but shouldn't he at least know the basics to avoid mistakes?

"Um... if you could give me a little time...!"

"Hey! You brat! Are you defying the king's command?"

Shirone shut his mouth tight.

What hurt most was Ordos's attitude.

Since he was an administrative executive of the kingdom, his high-handed approach was tolerable.

What truly pained Shirone was the royal command written on the scroll.

If they were his birth parents... he thought they shouldn't summon a child they had neglected for 18 years in such a manner.

He didn't expect an apology, but if they felt any pangs of conscience, shouldn't they show some consideration?

If not for him, then for the parents who had raised him in their stead.

Alpheas nudged Olivia's side.

"Help him out this time too. Nothing will work with him acting like that."

"Hmm..."

Olivia had been thinking of stepping in if necessary.

The reason the Kingdom of Kasula was stricter than Tormia was because it had only been independently separated for 100 years.

Even so, Ordos's attitude was too harsh for someone who had come to fetch his own child.

It probably wasn't the royal family's instruction.

Since it was expected that he would have received orders to accommodate Shirone as much as possible, it could only be seen that Ordos's personality was originally like this.

While a meticulous personality might help with work, treating Shirone carelessly when he might soon become a prince was, to put it kindly, upright, and to put it harshly, arrogant.

"Then please give me just one day. My parents don't know anything about this. To persuade them, I need at least one day."

Ordos's face reddened.

Of course, he was famous for his nasty temper, but in his own country, he wasn't quite this stubborn.

But this was Tormia, a rival nation under the name of alliance, and it was a magic school where nobles were watching.

If he showed weakness, the Kingdom of Kasula's reputation would suffer.

It was unfortunate for Shirone, but Ordos was only doing his utmost loyalty for his country.

Moreover, Shirone's parents were commoners.

It might be different if they were nobles, but if it took time to bring commoners, his pride was hurt.

"I refuse. The king's command is absolute! Therefore, right now...!"

At that moment, someone's voice was heard from the main gate.

"We have already secured the identity of Shirone's parents."

As students turned around and the crowd parted, Shirone's eyes widened.

Someone completely unexpected was walking toward them.

Before students could wonder about her identity, they were captivated by her beautiful appearance.

She had a slender figure with a small face. Her features were refreshingly distinct, and her sea-blue hair flowed in curls following a perm.

"Wow, she's beautiful. Who is she?"

"Oh? I know that person. She's a really famous musician in the kingdom."

Shirone stared at her blankly.

It was Reina Ozent, Rian's older sister.

Beside her stood the deputy butler Temuran with sharp eyes.

Reina made eye contact with Shirone but ignored him, walking straight to where Ordos was.

"Hello, Mr. Ordos. I've heard much about your reputation."

Ordos was displeased that his work was being disrupted.

But Reina's appearance and attitude carried the distinctive scent of nobility, so he couldn't raise his voice.

"Who are you?"

"I am Reina of the Ozent family. I've come as a representative of the head of the family, Ozent Bischoff, and as Shirone's legal guardian."

If it was the Ozent family, it was a well-reputed military household that Ordos knew by name.

Moreover, if she had the authority of the family head's representative, he couldn't show the same cold attitude as before.

"I see. Then let's discuss the process of transferring custody of Shirone. First..."

"First."

Reina interrupted.

"I request three days of preparation time. Shirone is a guest invited by the kingdom and has not yet learned about Kasula's protocol. Lewis, the head butler of the Ozent family, departed for Kasula yesterday. If we discuss the entry procedures there, there will be no waste of time. Meanwhile, we will teach Shirone Kasula's etiquette. Also, all future matters related to Shirone can be handled through the Ozent family's dedicated team."

"Hmm."

Ordos fell into thought.

He had tried personal measures to secure Shirone quickly, but now that a representative had appeared, using authority to crush the situation was useless. From now on, it would become a diplomatic issue.

Anyway, since the Ozent family said they would prepare, it was right for him to return and discuss administrative matters with this person called Lewis.

"Very well. I'll leave matters here in your hands. If anything comes up, consult with my adjutant Daltos here. I'll return to Kasula and convey your words."

"Yes, then I'll see you at the royal castle."

After the customary greetings ended, Ordos boarded his carriage.

Just as when they had arrived, the knights turned with grand gestures and departed, escorting the carriage.

Shirone was dumbfounded by the situation that had passed in an instant. Then, seeing Reina, his eyes filled with tears of relief.

With Ordos pressuring him and leaving him completely flustered, Reina's appearance felt like salvation.

"Sister Reina..."

Though Shirone called out, Reina was still consulting with Temuran with a serious face.

When she pointed to documents and gave instructions, Temuran nodded and stepped back.

Only then did Reina turn and approach Shirone.

As the distance closed, her businesslike expression cleared and her original beautiful smile appeared.

Reina winked at Shirone and spoke in her characteristically cheerful voice.

"It's been a while, Shirone. Have you been well?"

**The Ozent Family Situation (1)**

Four days before Ordos came to find Shirone, Reina visited the Kaizen Swordsmanship School where Rian attended.

In her hand was a crumpled midterm report card, and her face was filled with anger.

After completing the meeting procedures and heading straight to the faculty office, she finally found him.

It was Kuan, Rian's dedicated instructor.

Before his injury, he had made a name for himself on battlefields, but currently, that was completely irrelevant to her feelings.

How could it make sense that Rian was dead last?

After returning from playing around on Galliante Island and claiming his swordsmanship had made progress, she had secretly expected something, but the school's evaluation was unmistakably failing.
