title: Chapter 263 - The Ozent Family Situation (2)
date: 2025-08-30

Quan was in the middle of a conversation with a female teacher. This teacher was also someone Reina knew by reputation.

It was Kiyora Ellis, a renowned surgeon in the kingdom.

Ellis specialized in neural grafting, a field known to be impossible without genius-level talent even among surgical procedures.

However, Reina, who had begun to distrust Kaizen Sword School, wondered if this too might be false advertising.

If neural grafting were truly possible, why was Quan, standing right in front of her, limping on one leg?

When Quan said something with a cold expression, Ellis covered her mouth and laughed.

"Hehehe! So you just ate dinner and came back? You're really something."

"Shut up. Do this one more time and I'll kill you."

Ellis patted Quan's back.

"Oh come on, it's nothing to get so angry about. Your childhood friend is aging into spinsterhood, so naturally this big sister had to step in. Besides, if it's Olifer Siena, she'd make perfect wife material."

Quan recalled the events from a few days ago.

He had gone out because there was supposedly an important appointment, only to find it was a matchmaking meeting arranged by Ellis.

His counterpart was Olifer Siena, a mage currently attending Alpheas Magic School.

It was doomed from the start, as she too seemed to have come under family pressure.

Of course, she wasn't rude enough to show such feelings, but wouldn't a woman's eyes change first if she found a man appealing?

"She was a good person though. Well-educated too."

"Oh?"

Ellis was genuinely surprised.

Quan had never once praised a woman before. In his youth, he lived obsessed with swords, and after injuring his Achilles tendon, he showed no interest in anything in the world.

For such praise to come from his mouth meant it was the highest compliment possible.

"So you liked her? Then I'll arrange another meeting...!"

When murderous intent gleamed in Quan's eyes, Ellis shrank her shoulders with a frightened expression.

Quan at times like this was absolutely not to be provoked.

On one hand, Ellis felt sorry for her friend.

If he liked Siena, he should have somehow secured her interest right then and there. But given Quan's personality, he would never do such a thing.

'Don't tell me... did she find fault with his leg?'

While the Olifer family would naturally possess good breeding, you never knew what might happen.

From what she heard, it was obvious he had been forced to attend, and above all, matters between men and women often involved uncontrolled emotions.

'What's wrong with limping a little? Men really have no eye for women.'

Quan's injury was beyond even Ellis's neural grafting capabilities. The ligament hadn't just torn—it had been completely severed.

When Quan returned from the battlefield having lost his leg, she wept for days and nights in helpless frustration at being unable to do anything.

Before earning the nickname "Death Magician," he had been evaluated as the incarnation of the sword itself. How devastating it must have been for such a man to lose one leg.

A year later, Ellis offered Quan a teaching position at the sword school. And she resolved that no matter how long it took, she would definitely heal his leg.

For that reason, she hated this woman called Siena to death.

Though she couldn't imagine her face having never seen her, befitting an authority on ice magic, she probably gave off freezing cold vibes.

Who did she think she was to reject Quan?

Her eye for men was completely terrible.

"Quan, by any chance did that woman...!"

Reina interrupted Ellis's words as she approached.

"Teacher Quan!"

Quan looked Reina up and down before asking indifferently.

"Who might you be?"

"I'm Reina, Rian's sister! We had an appointment for a consultation today."

Quan sipped his coffee and nodded.

"Ah, I think that might have been the case."

Reina was dumbfounded.

A parent had requested a consultation, and he "thinks that might have been the case"?

Such an indifferent teacher—that's why he couldn't see Rian's true worth and gave him failing grades.

Ellis smiled brightly and offered a seat.

"Oh my, is that so! Rian is such a kind and righteous child. Come, come! Please sit over here. Would you like some coffee? Or perhaps some other tea?"

As Ellis treated her warmly, Reina also tried to calm her excitement.

If only Quan hadn't added fuel to her cooling anger.

"But what brings you here? There doesn't seem to be any particular problem with Rian. He's still ignorant, only does strength training, and still in last place, kukuku."

As venom filled Reina's eyes, Ellis, who had been subtly gauging the situation, slipped away.

In her experience, the best strategy in such situations was to leave as quickly as possible.

Reina thought she would endure it just once and presented the report card.

"Here, please look at this."

"It's Rian's report card. A last-place report card."

"From what I've heard, Rian's grades aren't inferior to the other children. So why is he failing? I'd like an explanation about this."

Quan spoke as if it were nothing significant.

"He can't do schema."

Reina was dumbfounded.

"Even so, how can you give him a failing grade? I know how to do schema too! But if I fought Rian now, I'd probably lose! Is it acceptable to judge a student based on just that?"

"If Miss Reina had learned swordsmanship, you would have beaten Rian."

Reina was left speechless.

That was indeed the case. For a swordsman—to command anywhere from hundreds to tens of thousands of soldiers in the future—knowing schema was absolutely essential.

"But... but how can you give him last place..."

Tears welled up in Reina's eyes from frustration.

This was her youngest brother, who had lost their mother early and was practically raised by her own hands.

While her other brothers were succeeding, Rian remained unable to escape last place.

Her heart broke thinking how frustrated her brother must feel.

They say women's tears are men's weakness, but this didn't apply to Quan.

"He has no talent. Graduation is impossible at this rate. Even if he graduates, who would hire a swordsman who can't use schema? At best, he'd be a bodyguard for nouveau riche. Recently, he seems to be trying something strange called imagination schema, but from what I can see, it's futile. He has absolutely no sense for swords."

Reina slammed both hands on the table as she argued.

"I looked it up too, imagination schema! It may not be academically verified, but it definitely has potential. I read in books about something called divine transcendence..."

"Ah, divine transcendence."

Quan cut off Reina's words.

Even his somewhat polite attitude vanished, and a faint murderous intent swirled in his eyes.

Divine transcendence.

Transcending the physical body? What absurd nonsense was this?

"Do you see my leg? I'm limping on one side, aren't I? My Achilles tendon was severed. That's why I limp. The body is like a machine. Without parts, it cannot function. If divine transcendence were possible, I wouldn't be limping either. Imagination schema is nothing more than strengthening the brain among schema patterns. It's not some kind of magic."

Reina no longer wanted to continue the conversation. She couldn't let her brother be taught at such a school.

"I'll process the transfer paperwork. I'm taking Rian with me. Please handle it right now."

"What do you think will be different at another school?"

"That no longer seems to be something Mr. Quan needs to worry about. Whether we boil or roast my brother, our family will handle it ourselves."

Reina spoke as if making a declaration and turned around.

The teachers who had been watching the situation shook their heads. This was already the seventh case of a parent transferring their child after fighting with Quan.

Behind Reina's retreating figure, Quan muttered as if spitting out the words.

"I think he needs to be watched a little longer."

Reina's steps came to an abrupt halt.

When she turned around with a surprised expression, Quan, his face twisted in annoyance, added one more comment.

"That's what I'd say if I were being maximally generous."

The teachers were bewildered.

Quan, notorious for his terrible temperament, had never once tried to keep a departing student.

Reina walked back to Quan and asked with the desperation of grasping at straws.

"So... you mean there's still possibility left?"

Quan scratched his head as if annoyed.

"Look, Miss Reina. I know you're an excellent musician. But swordsmanship isn't art. It's thoroughly functional killing technique. Things like swordsmanship philosophy are privileges only those who reach the supreme realm can enjoy. Rian definitely lacks talent. But if it's imagination schema, perhaps it might be possible."

"That's exactly what I'm saying! That's why I said he could do it! Why did you lie?"

Quan sighed.

"Imagination schema is a realm of will. Though it can't be verified, any swordsman who has spent long periods on battlefields will experience it at least once. I too believe it exists. But that's precisely why no one can force it. What Rian needs is to run more and swing more."

"So you deliberately gave him last place? To make him swing more?"

"Simply put, well, that's about right."

Reina shook her head.

"Do you think that makes sense? What about grades then? Even if he graduates, how could a last-place student become a commander?"

Quan picked up Rian's report card from the table.

Next to the last-place ranking were the scores he had recorded in various tests.

"What exactly is the problem? Rian currently produces 1.8 times stronger muscle power than students who use schema. Particularly his right arm, which he mainly uses, is 3.7 times stronger. This is truly an unusual case that the school is monitoring. It seems he had some kind of awakening during vacation..."

Reina recalled Rian boasting when he returned from Galliant Island.

If Quan was saying this much, her brother's stories might not have been complete nonsense after all.

"For a swordsman, that's enough. Grades don't guarantee a swordsman's life. It means enemies on the battlefield don't spare first-place students and kill last-place ones."

Reina gradually lowered her guard.

"But... but if Rian becomes frustrated..."

Quan looked at Reina with disdain.

Well, how could someone who handles musical instruments all day understand the heart of someone who handles swords?

"Miss Reina, if he were the type to be frustrated by such grades, imagination schema would have been impossible from the start, and he wouldn't have been able to train enough to produce these muscle power figures. The records written here are the complete product of effort. I don't know how well you know your brother, but right now this kid is conducting experiments that transcend human limits every single day. He's dissecting his own body as if it were someone else's. You can't even imagine how painful that is. Do you think someone living in hell every day would care about such trivial rankings?"

Reina blinked.

She hadn't known because he never showed it. She had no idea that Rian, who always seemed so young to her, was enduring such painful training.

Quan handed the report card to Reina.

"Ah..."

As Reina received it, Quan turned his body and said.

"Take him or don't, do as you please. But it would be better not to fill his head with nonsense about divine transcendence or whatever. That's the only path for that kid to make a living with swords. Unless someone can suffer that pain in his place, keep your mouth shut."

Reina looked down at the report card.

Last place.

But next to it were the figures Rian had recorded.

She could see Rian swinging his sword until his muscles tore to raise his score by just 0.1 points.

Reina clutched the report card with both hands and bowed her head to Quan.

"Please continue to provide Rian with much guidance and instruction."

Quan only narrowed his brow without answering.

@

Leaving the faculty office, Reina felt lighthearted for the first time in a while.

Until now, thinking of her brother had always made her heart heavy, but this consultation had given her hope, which was fortunate.

'That's right, if a man has decided to do something, he should climb to the very top. If it's divine transcendence, he could even aspire to become a great sword master, right?'

While her heart fluttered with excitement, she didn't forget Quan's advice.

Never show it to Rian.

For someone undergoing difficult training daily, even words of encouragement could break his will.
