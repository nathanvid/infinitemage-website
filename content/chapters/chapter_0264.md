title: Chapter 264 - he Ozent Family Situation (3)
date: 2025-08-30

Since he was at the school anyway, he thought he might as well buy them a meal after such a long time.

Lately, Tess had been spending time with that young lady, and that was one thing he liked about the situation. He'd only met her once, but she had a gentle personality and seemed like a good child who could handle Rian's stubbornness.

When he arrived at the training ground, he saw Rian practicing swordsmanship.

He'd heard that because Tess packed lunch boxes, Rian trained like this even during lunch break.

Rian was striking a dummy with a club, and even from a distance, he could feel the intense energy radiating from him.

Tess's gaze, as she sat on the grass drinking water, had been fixed on the club that Rian was explosively swinging.

Ever since returning from Heaven, Rian had intensified his training, and now he spent more time moving than resting.

Tess picked up the Spirit magazine that Rian had thrown aside.

It contained an article about Shirone, who had defeated Dante, the kingdom's top star.

He must have read it so many times that the paper where Shirone appeared was worn thin and the letters had faded.

The following pages also had an article about Shirone's parents, but after glancing at it briefly, he never looked at it again.

'Rian... this must be painful for him.'

Tess knew what kind of feelings Rian trained with.

Rian was Shirone's sword, and the magnitude of his resolve could be felt just from when he returned from Heaven.

For him, Shirone's success would be joy beyond anything else, but his disappointment in himself would have grown twice as much.

The fact that his training had increased 1.5 times since the day after reading the article said it all.

1.5 times might be considered pushing oneself slightly for a swordsman, but Rian's case was an exception.

For someone who already tested his limits every day, a 1.5-fold increase was a murderous daily routine.

But Rian had done it.

It was a strange phenomenon unique to Rian that couldn't be explained by any talent.

Tess clicked her tongue watching the trajectory of the sword Rian wielded.

It was as if he was putting his soul into each strike.

'He's really strong. Honestly, even if I faced him with Schema, I wonder if I could handle it.'

But Rian's thoughts were different.

'Not enough. I can't defeat him with this level.'

Rian wasn't looking at the dummy.

He was looking at the phantom of Ymir that appeared behind the dummy.

Though small for a giant, his strength was embedded deep in Rian's bones.

"Uaaaah!"

Rian brought down the club like a madman.

It was a specially made club with the exact same weight as the greatsword he'd inherited from his grandfather. Yet he wielded it as if it were a switch.

'No! No! No!'

When he first trained with dummy striking, he felt like dying from the agony every time he swung.

But after passing through that process, now thirst came rushing in.

Why wasn't he moving faster? How had he done it when he cut Ymir's arm?

At that moment, the illusion of all his attacks being destroyed by Ymir's single blow rushed over him.

A giant fist flew toward his face.

Ymir shouted.

'That's not it!'

"Uaaaah!"

Rian brought the club straight down vertically.

The dummy, struck hard on the crown, crumbled from the pillar and exploded into fragments.

"Whoa..."

Tess's eyes widened.

This wasn't the first time he'd broken a dummy, but this strike was subtly different from the others.

Realizing this fact, Rian also remained frozen in his striking posture for a while, savoring the feeling from just before.

He had to absorb every sensation.

A talented swordsman might have insights they knew without trying, but the only path he could take was learning through his body.

"Rian! Your sister's here!"

Rian's face contorted at Reina's voice.

It was fortunate he'd roughly grasped the sensation, but if she'd called him just a little earlier, everything would have been ruined.

"What? What brings you to school all of a sudden?"

Before Reina could answer, Tess came running over.

Scoring points early with someone who would become his future sister-in-law was the first item written in the romance manual he'd recently read.

"Hello."

"Yes, it's been a while, Tess."

Rian asked again.

"What's the matter?"

"Oh, well..."

Reina trailed off.

Having received advice from Kuan, she felt that saying she came because of grades would backfire.

But she didn't have any particular excuse either, so she was stalling for time when suddenly a guard shouted from outside the training ground.

"Everyone! Attention!"

Rian, Tess, and Reina turned their gazes toward the entrance of the training ground.

Ozent Clump, Rian's grandfather, was walking over with the sword school teachers trailing behind him like a tail.

It was natural for the teachers, who were also swordsmen, to be flustered when a certified third-rank swordsman came to visit the school.

But Rian and Reina were anxious for different reasons.

Although his retirement wasn't far off, Clump was still a major figure who wielded tremendous influence in the military.

If such a person had suddenly come to the school, it meant this wasn't an ordinary matter.

Rian and Tess immediately assumed attention posture.

Even if they were family, as students of the sword school, they were positioned at the bottom of the military organization.

If they didn't show proper respect to Commander Clump, they could actually be punished under military law.

"At ease."

When Clump's order came down, Rian and Tess obeyed the command by lowering their rigid shoulders just slightly.

Clump looked around at the scene in the training ground. Since it was lunch time, Rian and Tess were all there were.

"Training even during lunch break? Very commendable attitude."

"Thank you."

Tess straightened his body again and spoke.

This was the second time facing Clump. He'd greeted him before when invited to Reina's house for dinner.

He remembered that despite being a tough warrior, Clump had a cheerful personality and had put him at ease, but he couldn't act recklessly in this situation.

The teachers standing behind were also holding their breath, watching to see how the situation would unfold.

Clump carefully observed Rian's balance.

He knew that Rian had come in last place on the midterm exams. When Reina had made a fuss about going to the school to argue about it, he had just laughed it off.

How high one climbs is important, but he thought Rian's will to never give up was his greatest weapon.

But when he actually checked, it was different from his expectations.

Clump took the club Rian was holding and swung it around in various ways.

Hmm, he thought, then reached out to knead Rian's shoulders and arms.

At one moment his hand paused, then his eyes lit up.

"Same weight as the Ozent family's straight sword. Do you swing it until the dummy breaks?"

"Yes."

Clump chuckled and returned the club.

"Definitely a brutish method that's just like you."

Rian's lower lip protruded slightly.

If this wasn't school, he would have clearly shown the terror of the youngest grandson, but in this place, rank was everything.

"Well... do as you please. It's your life."

"Yes, that's what I intend to do."

When Rian answered prickly within the bounds of not crossing the line, Clump laughed, his shoulders shaking.

For some reason, he looked very pleased.

When he looked around at the teaching staff and nodded as if they had taught well, the teachers finally sighed in relief.

Reina could now roughly guess what her grandfather had sensed in Rian.

With such thoughts, when she slyly looked at Kuan, sure enough, he was also looking at her with a prickly gaze.

Feeling embarrassed, she primly turned her head away.

Anyway, it was fortunate that Rian didn't seem too disagreeable in the eyes of the swordsmen.

Clump stopped paying attention to Rian and approached Reina.

"So you were here. I looked for you at the royal castle, and when I heard you'd gone here, I came right over."

"What? Don't tell me you came because of me? What's the matter?"

Clump glanced at Rian and gave a look suggesting they should move somewhere private.

The reason he came here was that intelligence had arrived from the Kingdom of Kasula a few days ago regarding Shirone's affairs.

Since Rian had made a knightly oath with Shirone, it would be proper to inform him, but Clump wanted to dissuade him.

He wasn't someone who could be reasoned with through blood ties. For this matter, calm Reina was more suitable than hot-tempered Rian.

Clump took Reina into the shade of a tree.

Rian made a sullen expression at being left out, but soon dismissed it.

Both his grandfather and sister were busy people at the royal castle, so he just thought something must have come up.

When Reina heard about Shirone's situation from Clump, her eyes widened.

"What? The first prince of the Kingdom of Kasula?"

"It's not certain yet, but that seems to be the case. They seem almost convinced of it. The circumstances of helping Shirone escape, the timing, the location - everything matches up. The fact that Shirone was the only child abandoned near the Valley of Dawn also supports this."

Reina remained silent for a long time, trying to organize her thoughts.

But this wasn't a matter of analyzing complex cause and effect relationships. If it had already been decided that way, what mattered was how to handle things going forward.

"So... you need me to go to the main house. Take Shirone to the Kingdom of Kasula. You're probably the only one who can do it."

Reina thought she was indeed the right person for this.

She was the only one in the swordsman family of Ozent with a wide range of social activities as an artist, and her connections were solid since joining the Elite Artists' Circle of 99.

However, she was also concerned about Rian. If she proceeded while hiding the truth and he found out later, he would be greatly disappointed.

"Shouldn't we tell Rian?"

"No. As you can probably guess, the atmosphere is quite serious. A small mistake could ruin everything. But as you know, that boy is rather reckless."

"That's true."

Since this involved crossing to another country to meet with a king, reason was more important than emotion.

In that regard, Rian was the number one risk factor.

If it involved Shirone, he wouldn't see anything else, not even a king or a god.

"I understand. I'll keep it secret from Rian and go."

"The meeting date and itinerary were sent through intelligence. You must never reveal this until you arrive in Creas. Shirone must not know about this either."

Intelligence always flows in major and minor affairs between nations. But only a very few have the authority to verify the substance of that intelligence.

The reason conspiracy theories arise is because of the secrecy of shadow diplomacy.

In one sense, it's like playing house, but when that playing house is on a national scale, the story changes.

Since even trivial matters like deciding an envoy's lodgings could become the fuse that triggers war, secrecy had to be maintained at all costs.

"The location is Alpheas Magic School. Fifty armed soldiers will accompany them, and Kasula's administrative executive Ordos will serve as envoy to make contact with Shirone. We've sent a reply on our side too, but from now on it's a battle of wits. They'll probably try to take Shirone first before we arrive. We need to move as quickly as possible. You should be able to buy us time."

Reina felt a heavy sense of mission and nodded.

"Yes, I understand. Then I'll prepare immediately and leave."

**Kingdom of Kasula (1)**

The three days of preparation time that Ordos had requested were over.

Shirone was riding in a carriage with Reina toward the school, receiving tests on court etiquette.

"What is the first thing to do during audience time?"

"Kneel, keep your gaze 45 degrees down, place your hands on your chest. State your rank and name and say, 'I await Your Majesty's summons.'"

"What is the official morning time standard designated by the royal castle?"

"Thirty minutes before the lunch bell rings."

Reina nodded with satisfaction.

"Good, very well done. That's impressive."

"Hehe! It was easy because there are many similarities with the Kingdom of Tormia."

The Kingdoms of Tormia and Kasula were brother nations that had gained independence from the Yakma Republic, so despite differences in era, their cultures and lifestyles weren't very different.

Of course, from Shirone's perspective as a non-noble, there was indeed a lot to memorize.

But Reina wasn't worried.

She believed he would succeed since he'd been a bright child from an early age, and indeed, in just three days he had completely absorbed all the etiquette into his head.

But Shirone himself still seemed anxious.

"What if I make a mistake? I mean, thirty minutes before lunch time is incredibly vague."

Reina patted Shirone's head and said.

"Fufu, there's nothing to be nervous about. Even nobles get that wrong a lot. Of course, it's better to follow it if possible, but you won't go to prison for mistaking the time."
