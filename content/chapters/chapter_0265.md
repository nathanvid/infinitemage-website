Even after arriving at school, Shirone and Reina continued their conversation as they walked to the dormitory.

Shirone's face turned red at Reina's mischievous jokes. Seeing this, Reina found him even more adorable and giggled.

Male students watched Shirone with envious eyes.

Reina was not only beautiful but also a famous pianist who could be called the idol of the nobility.

Having such a person walk arm-in-arm with Shirone made his status appear elevated as well.

Amy and Seriel stopped walking when they saw the two heading to the dormitory side by side.

They had also been heading to the dormitory to greet Shirone, but seeing the affectionate pair, they couldn't bring themselves to approach and say hello.

Amy had heard that Reina was Rian's sister. But the atmosphere was completely different from three days ago.

At first they had been distant, but now they had grown so close that they were practically walking body to body.

Seriel made a fuss while tapping Amy's shoulder.

"Oh my, oh my! Amy, do you see that? Are you sure those two really have nothing going on?"

"How would I know? She's Rian's sister, so I guess they're close. When he was a servant before, they probably lived together, right?"

"No, that's not it. I looked into it, and during the year and six months that Shirone was a regular servant at the Ozent family, Reina was away studying as an apprentice to a famous pianist. They didn't have time to become close. But to get this close in such a short time... could it be?"

Amy pushed Seriel's back.

"Oh, forget it. Let's just go."

Seeing that she had even done background research showed just how curious she was about their relationship.

Amy wasn't feeling great about it either. But since Shirone's business was important right now, she suppressed her emotions and followed.

Women couldn't enter the men's dormitory, but the day Shirone was leaving was an exception. An event that could potentially produce the first prince of the Kingdom of Kasula had enough impact to override school rules.

The Ozent family's carriage was waiting in front of the dormitory.

When Amy and Seriel greeted the teachers who were talking at the entrance, they nodded casually and continued their conversation.

Even before reaching Shirone's room, they could hear Reina's laughter from inside. Amy's chest stung, but she forced herself to ignore it and continued walking.

When they arrived at the room, Iruki and Nade were snickering while Shirone and Reina were holding each other and dancing.

They seemed to be teaching dance in preparation for the ball to be held at the royal palace. It was just that and nothing more, but seeing Shirone's flushed face made Amy's stomach twist strangely.

Shirone's dance moves were incredibly awkward.

Of course, it didn't make sense for the kingdom's top magic student candidate to lack coordination. He had clearly stiffened under Reina's affectionate gaze.

"Huh? A-Amy."

Seeing Amy enter, Shirone hastily escaped from Reina's embrace.

Amy pretended not to notice and entered the room. She also saw the idiotic duo of Nade and Iruki gulping, but cleanly ignored them.

Reina smiled with her eyes and raised her hand.

"Oh my, Amy's here. Hello?"

Amy offered a formal but polite greeting.

"Hello. Today's the departure day, right?"

"Yes. I was doing some final practice with Shirone. Surprisingly, he has no talent for dancing."

Shirone waved his hands as if wronged.

"No! It's because I was too nervous...!"

Reina covered her mouth and laughed.

"Hohoho! Nervous? Don't tell me it's because you're practicing with me?"

When Shirone couldn't speak and just stammered, Amy's anger flared up.

Even if it was fake dating, they were officially a couple. She had told Reina as much, so it would be normal to show some consideration, even formally.

Yet Shirone was sticking close to Reina and wouldn't separate from her.

There seemed to be some special connection between the two, but she couldn't tell what it was and didn't want to know.

Amy set aside her thoughts and asked Shirone.

"Are you all ready?"

"Yes. But I'm worried. I feel like I'll make mistakes."

"What's there to worry about? They'll laugh off any minor mistakes."

Amy caught a flash of tension in Shirone's eyes for a brief moment.

She had thought his mind had gone blank from being distracted by Reina, but he seemed to be aware of things to some degree.

On the surface, it was parents looking for their child, but thinking deeper, there were certainly many strange aspects.

Reina patted Shirone's shoulder reassuringly.

"It'll be fine. Since the Kingdom of Kasula has made this public, there shouldn't be any particular danger. Kasula isn't exactly a strong nation compared to Tormia, and our family won't just stand by doing nothing."

Just hearing this made the anxiety seem to fade.

Reina had accurate judgment, was well-informed about the kingdom's political situation, and knew well about the power dynamics between royalty and nobility.

If she was taking responsibility and leading, nothing particularly strange should happen.

"Yes. I'll trust only you, sister."

When Shirone answered with a smile, Reina also stroked Shirone's head with a pleased expression.

Then, as if suddenly remembering, she turned to look at Amy. As expected, her complexion didn't look good.

'I do feel a bit sorry.'

During the three days of preparation, Reina had carefully checked all the people around Shirone.

Overall, he had good relationships with his friends, and especially Iruki and Nade would become good companions in Shirone's life going forward.

The problem was the relationship between Shirone and Amy.

They said they were lovers with their mouths, but listening to their conversations, it absolutely wasn't the case.

If they were lovers, a unique intimacy would naturally show. But Shirone and Amy didn't give off that particular feeling.

Yet they had been acting as fake lovers for a whole year.

Unless they were emotional tightrope walking experts, normally it should result in one of two situations - either breaking apart or sticking together.

Reina had seen countless cases where time passed like this and they ended up as just ordinary friends.

From her perspective, the two had no real relationship.

Of course, there was definitely potential for them to burn hot if sparks flew, but given their personalities, the probability was extremely low.

Her mouth itched from frustration, but when she thought about them actually getting together, she felt inexplicably angry and lost all desire to help.

Reina realized this was also a type of jealousy, but created a mental reprieve by thinking that if there were no competitors, there was no need to worry.

'Hehe, come to think of it, I'm not in a position to talk about others either.'

Reina checked the time and said to Shirone.

"Well then, let's depart. We need to pick up your parents too, so we should leave quickly."

Amy interrupted.

"Wait a moment. Let me talk with Shirone."

"Huh? Do it downstairs. It'll take time to service the carriage anyway."

She knew the situation wasn't relaxed. But Amy had an answer she absolutely needed to hear from Shirone.

"It'll just take a moment."

Amy cut straight to the point and requested a short time. Reina blinked and said as if she had no choice.

"Then I'll go down first to prepare. Shirone, come down after you finish talking."

After Reina left, Nade and Iruki bowed respectfully.

Whatever fox-like behavior she had shown, the fool trio seemed to have fallen completely for her.

Amy snorted in response and drove everyone except Shirone out of the room.

Shirone, who had packed clothes in his backpack, slung one strap over his shoulder and turned around.

"I'll be back, Amy. Keep up the good work with exam preparation."

Amy cut straight to the main point.

"Something definitely seems off. You know it too."

Shirone gave a bitter smile.

"That may be so, but... I don't want to think about it. If they're really my birth parents, I feel like I shouldn't have such thoughts."

Amy could understand Shirone's feelings. Everyone focused on the first prince of the Kingdom of Kasula, but for him, it was a journey to meet his blood relatives.

It would be a problem even if they really were his birth parents. They had abandoned their child. They had carved an unhealable wound into Shirone's heart.

"Will you really be okay?"

"I don't know. Nothing right now. I'll find out when I go, what kind of thoughts I'll have. But I don't want to make any judgments yet."

Sadness and anxiety appeared simultaneously on Shirone's face. Amy, who had been watching quietly, gathered courage and spoke up.

"Should I come with you?"

"Huh? What are you talking about?"

"If I come with you, it'll be much more helpful. There aren't any classes now anyway."

Shirone felt his chest grow warm, but soon shook his head. He couldn't steal the most important period of Amy's life for his own selfishness.

"It's okay. Reina is with me."

Shirone was startled when he felt a chill from Amy's eyes. Fortunately, that feeling disappeared quickly, but her words somehow had thorns embedded in them.

"Yeah, okay. Now let's go. That Reina is waiting."

Amy left the room without looking back. Shirone was still puzzled, but his own situation was so chaotic that he had no time to deeply examine her feelings.

Outside the dormitory, Reina was holding a folder and checking the carriage luggage item by item.

Shirone exchanged farewell greetings while receiving his friends' send-off. It was a schedule of at most 10 days, but for some reason it felt like a final goodbye.

Nade said.

"Have a safe trip. If you become king, you must buy me a super-large cream bun from the store."

"Haha! Okay. But it'll be vacation when I return."

Reina watched Shirone talking with his friends with a pleased expression.

Like Rian, Shirone had changed a lot in one year.

Above all, the incident of defeating Dante, who had been the kingdom's best, was a great source of pride for the Ozent family too.

Rian's eye wasn't wrong.

And neither was hers.

When Reina looked at Shirone with tender emotions, Seriel became a fury incarnate, trembling her fists.

"Shirone is really disappointing. At times like this, a man should draw a clear line."

Seriel, who turned to Amy as if seeking agreement, was shocked.

Amy, who had been taking things lightly until now, was glaring at Reina with fierce eyes.

"Seriel, I'm going."

Seriel's face went pale. Of course such talk had come up, but she didn't know Amy would really make the decision.

"Amy, really?"

Seriel's eyes soon changed to worry.

The graduation exam would be held in two weeks. There was no time to worry about other things.

"It's fine. Classes are over anyway, and I'll just take an overseas trip for a change of mood."

Seriel knew better than anyone that this wasn't true.

On one hand, she envied Amy for being able to throw everything away in such a situation.

If she had decided to go anyway, she should send her off with full support. So she wouldn't look back. So no regrets would remain.

Seriel pushed Amy's back and said.

"Go for it. This big sister gives permission."

Amy hastily added.

"I-It's not because I'm worried about Miss Reina! I'm just worried about Shirone..."

"Hohoho! I know! Who's saying anything? Go flatten that nose!"

With Seriel's encouragement, Amy walked toward the carriage.

Then Shirone, who had just been preparing to board, turned around and offered a farewell greeting.

"Amy, fighting! You must pass. I'll do well and come back too."

"Could you move aside?"

"Huh?"

Shirone didn't understand. Then Amy waved her hand to the side as if annoyed and said.

"Move aside. Ladies first, don't you know?"

When she pushed past Shirone and climbed into the carriage, Reina made an dumbfounded expression. Regardless, Amy bent her waist and entered.

"Hello. Please take good care of me on the way."

"Oh my, where are you going?"

Reina, who was quite angry, pretended not to know even though she did. Nothing would change anyway, but she didn't want to acknowledge this situation with her own mouth.

"Well, I was worried about sending him alone. I don't think he can manage without me looking after him."

Shirone opened the carriage door and stuck his face in.

"Amy! What's going on? Are you really going?"

"That's why I got in. Hurry up and sit. We don't have time."

Reina's insides burned like a furnace.

Carmis Amy.

From watching her for several days, she had a cautious personality in everything, making her fun to tease, but now she could see she was the same hot-tempered type as Rian.

She felt regretful about lighting an unnecessary torch, but the water was already spilled.
