"Are you really going to go? I'm seriously fine on my own."

Shirone didn't like the idea of Amy getting distracted by other things when graduation exams were approaching.

No matter how much she was the top candidate for graduation, anything could happen in competition. If she happened to fail, he would bear some responsibility for it.

Of course, Amy would never think that way, but from his perspective of wanting her success, he felt like talking her out of it.

"This is important to you, isn't it? Miss Reina will be busy handling royal procedures, so you need someone to stay by your side and escort you. What, don't you like the idea of me going?"

If Amy accompanied him, there couldn't be anything more reassuring for Shirone.

It was the same when they went to Galliant Island—in terms of ability, she was an absolute ally.

"No, of course I'd be happy about it, but..."

"Then that settles it. End of discussion. I owe you some debts anyway, so I should repay them at times like this."

Shirone couldn't recall what Amy owed him for, but countless events flashed through Amy's mind.

It was Shirone who had saved her from the cliff during Arcane's attack incident, and when she was captured by Kariel in Heaven, she wouldn't have returned safely if not for him.

When Amy stubbornly held her ground, Reina let out a resigned sigh and gave instructions to the coachman.

"Let's depart."

Of course, setting emotions aside, Amy's joining was absolutely not a disadvantage. Having a friend would be much better for helping Shirone. However, she couldn't help feeling pushed back from the very start.

Reina rested her chin against the window and pouted her lips.

She could almost see Amy's smile.

The carriage was heading to the Thorn Mine, located on the middle slopes of the Origin Mountains where Shirone's home was situated. Along the way, Reina explained the general political situation.

Tormia, Kasula, and Yakma had once been a unified nation. However, as the nobles' influence grew, factional fighting broke out, and they eventually separated, currently forming a three-nation alliance system.

"In a sense, you could call them emerging nations. Kasula hasn't even been independent for 100 years. Particularly, the Yakma Republic refused to recognize Kasula's separation until recently. War didn't break out, but it almost did. That was exactly 18 years ago. In short, when Kasula's domestic politics became unstable, they moved the First Prince Shirone elsewhere."

Shirone felt somewhat comforted by the fact that at least they hadn't abandoned him out of hatred. Since the rise and fall of a kingdom was at stake, there must have been unavoidable circumstances.

Of course, that didn't make his hurt feelings disappear. It was just that since everything was still uncertain, he was deliberately ignoring the emotions that were welling up.

"I heard about it too. They say it almost reached the point of civil war. Yakma had also finished preparations for deployment. But..."

Amy trailed off. It wasn't something she could bear to say in front of Shirone.

It was the same for Reina, but as the leader of the group, it was something she couldn't avoid.

"Yes, all civil war ended when Kasula's King Orcamp IV married Empress Teraje of the Kashan Empire."

Shirone also knew what event this was from reading history books thoroughly. He just hadn't expected it to become his own affair.

The Kashan Empire was the absolute powerhouse of the continent, occupying one-third of the human realm's territory.

Moreover, the empire's rulers had traditionally been women.

Teraje, the emperor of Kashan, was said to be so beautiful that any man couldn't help but fall for her.

On the other hand, she was also a cold-blooded person who wouldn't hesitate to make any sacrifice to achieve victory.

Such a woman had proposed marriage to Orcamp, the king of Kasula.

"King Orcamp IV had no choice. The country was about to collapse. Moreover, accepting Teraje meant gaining tremendous connections. In fact, after marrying Teraje, Kasula's politics rapidly stabilized and its finances became solid."

It was an exceptional event worthy of detailed coverage in history books.

Above all, Orcamp already had a wife, and Teraje was also a woman with a husband.

"Political marriages among royalty or nobility aren't unusual, but this case was special. Teraje—no, the rulers of Kashan—had traditionally been women, and the strategy they used most to expand their influence was marriage. Besides King Orcamp IV, Teraje has three more husbands. Of course, they're all kings of various nations. After marrying Orcamp, Teraje would occasionally visit Kasula, and each time she would bear children, currently having both sons and daughters."

"Doesn't the original Queen of Kasula—that is, Queen Eliza Orcamp—have any other children besides Shirone?"

"Unfortunately, no. Right after evacuating the newborn child to another country during the civil war, Teraje immediately intervened. There was probably an agreement—that she shouldn't bear any more children. Teraje wants her own children to inherit the kingdom."

Amy sighed.

No matter how royal one might be, using the uniquely human ability of conception for politics was a chilling thing.

As a result, Shirone was effectively the only bloodline of the Kasula queen. And below him were the half-siblings born by Teraje.

Amy suddenly realized the source of the unease she had felt even before departure.

"Wait a minute. Then if Shirone becomes the First Prince of Kasula..."

Reina nodded with a serious expression as if that was indeed the crux of the matter.

"Yes, Teraje's children would be pushed back in the line of succession. Conversely, Queen Eliza's influence would strengthen. The reason a nation's envoy came to the magic school to make such a grand announcement is probably not unrelated to that."

Amy frowned.

Come to think of it, Kasula's political stabilization had happened already 10 years ago. Therefore, if the kingdom had put in just a little effort, finding Shirone would have been easy.

In the end, the fact that they were only now looking for Shirone clearly involved political issues.

Even if they were his biological parents... the fact that they hadn't invited him purely out of wanting to see Shirone weighed heavily on her heart.

'Ugh, why is everything so complicated? I never know what these high-ranking people are thinking.'

Teraje becomes Orcamp's concubine, and Orcamp becomes Teraje's consort.

It was an impossible situation that couldn't even be drawn in a family tree.

While each was lost in thought, the carriage raced quickly and soon entered the Thorn Mine.

It used to be a coal mining area, but was called the Thorn Mine because the stalactites hanging in the caves were sharp, and that became its proper name.

Currently it was a closed mine and blocked off, but the air was still quite acrid. However, for Shirone, it was the most nostalgic scent of home.

Seeing Shirone's rigid face soften a little, Amy also breathed in the acrid air with all her might.

Before getting out of the carriage upon arriving at Shirone's house, Amy straightened her posture.

This was her first time coming to Shirone's home. Moreover, since she was meeting his parents, she naturally became cautious.

Of course, she wouldn't make any mistakes, but the situation was a bit delicate.

Since Shirone's parents were commoners, she was rather worried about how to treat them.

If she was too polite, they might feel uncomfortable, but if she acted as usual, there was room for her to appear arrogant.

Unlike Amy who was having such thoughts, Reina opened the door and got out as soon as they arrived.

Vincent and Olina were waiting with their departure preparations complete.

While Assistant Butler Temuran inspected the carriage, Reina took Shirone to his parents.

"Hello. Have you been well?"

"Yes, of course. Thanks to your care, we've been living comfortably."

Vincent and Olina greeted them with utmost courtesy.

Reina didn't mind and naturally moved on to the schedule.

"We'll take the carriage north and cross the border. We'll probably arrive around midnight, so please bear with us until then. From there, you'll be escorted by the Kingdom of Kasula, so there shouldn't be any inconvenience in your stay."

"Please don't worry about us. We're just sorry to cause you trouble because of our son."

Reina smiled sympathetically. Looking at Vincent and Olina's faces, it was clear they hadn't slept a wink all night.

Temuran must have explained several times, but it wouldn't have been something they could feel as reality.

How could they understand a situation where, after raising a child abandoned in a stable as their own for 18 years, the biological parents suddenly appeared?

And they were the king and queen of another nation at that.

It was good news considering Shirone, but as long as they were human, how could they not feel hurt?

Moreover, since they couldn't file a paternity lawsuit against a king, they were helplessly about to lose their child.

"Don't worry too much. Nothing's certain yet, and even if the biological parents are confirmed, Shirone won't waver. It was the same with the Ozent family."

Vincent, caught off guard by having his inner thoughts exposed, waved his hands in panic.

"Worry? That's ridiculous! It's truly wonderful news for Shirone. Still, thank you for your concern."

At that moment, Amy's confident voice was heard from the carriage.

"Hello!"

When everyone's attention focused on her, Amy's face reddened. Seeing Reina and the parents chatting, her heart had rushed, causing her to interrupt at an odd timing.

"The young lady is...?"

Olina's eyes sparkled with interest as she showed curiosity. This was the first time Shirone had brought a girl his age.

She was pretty and had honest eyes—truly a good girl.

"Ah, yes. I'm Carmis Amy, Shirone's friend. I'll be accompanying you to Kasula. Please take care of me."

Amy unconsciously bowed awkwardly. Her confidence that she could remain calm in any situation was completely shattered.

Of course, this was only Amy's own thoughts, and Vincent and Olina smiled warmly and whispered that she seemed like a nice student.

Shirone remained silent. Honestly, he didn't know what face to show his parents.

He had been able to firmly refuse becoming someone's adopted son at the Ozent family, but this time they were his biological parents.

Moreover, since they were royalty, he had no choice, so he felt as if he was committing a crime against them.

Vincent, who had anticipated his son's feelings, approached.

"Are you okay, Shirone? You must be very surprised."

"I'm fine, Father... I'm sorry."

"Haha! What's there to be sorry about? I'll be grateful if you just don't make any mistakes at the royal palace. I did learn a lot from Master Temuran, but this is inherently difficult."

Shirone forced a smile.

"Me too. But don't worry. Amy will be with me, so it'll be fine."

Amy, thinking this was her chance, pointed to herself with her thumb.

"That's right! I'll take care of him, so you don't need to worry about that."

Olina smiled and said,

"Thank you. Now I remember the name. I heard Shirone has been receiving a lot of help."

Amy felt a bit proud. As her tension eased, her stiff lips also moved as she intended.

"I've also received a lot of help from Shirone. Please feel comfortable with me from now on."

Reina clapped her hands to draw attention.

It was good to continue the pleasant atmosphere, but there really was no more time to waste.

To arrive at the border before midnight, they needed to travel diligently from now on.

"Now, now. Let's depart. Assistant Butler, please wait at the mansion. Prepare to move as soon as word comes from Louis."

"Understood. Please travel safely."

The carriage carrying Shirone's group departed for Kasula.

@

It was a forced march.

Being in a rattling carriage for over six hours would make anyone's whole body ache. With a schedule of traveling for an hour and resting for five minutes, there wasn't even time to soothe their throbbing backs.

But no one complained.

As they approached the border, the pain gradually disappeared and tension filled the air.

From Shirone's perspective, it was quite an adventure.

Having heard about the complex circumstances of Kasula's royal family, even with an escort team waiting, it was a situation where he couldn't feel at ease. If Teraje's side made a slightly hasty decision, they might even send assassins.
