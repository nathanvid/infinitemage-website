Shirone opened the window and looked around.

They were in a deep forest, with only the torch stuck in the driver's seat illuminating the path ahead. Eerie tree shadows raced past in the opposite direction of their travel. It was fortunate that a full moon had risen. But clouds gathered from somewhere and covered even that.

Shirone's worries deepened.

At some point, the carriage began moving slowly and then came to a stop.

The sound of horses snorting echoed through the silent night air.

The coachman opened the door and spoke in a whisper.

"Lady Reina, we've arrived at the rendezvous point."

Reina wrapped herself in a hooded cloak. The others likewise covered their faces with hoods and got out of the carriage.

The place they arrived at was a vast wasteland where the horizon was visible. When Shirone drew a map in his mind and imagined it, it seemed to be somewhere around the Dawn Plateau north of Tormia.

He thought it was indeed thorough. In a wasteland open on all sides, it would be extremely difficult to attempt an assassination.

Of course, one could dig tunnels if they set their mind to it, but thinking along those lines would be endless.

The rendezvous point was 300 meters away from where they arrived, and the escort party from the Kingdom of Kasula could be seen as silhouettes in the distance.

Louis, the head butler of the Ozent family, sent hand signals.

When Reina exchanged codes in the same manner, the two groups finally met at the midpoint.

Louis, carrying a torch, approached and bowed to Shirone's party.

"Welcome. We've been waiting."

"You've worked hard. I heard the entry procedures are proceeding without problems."

"Yes. We haven't detected any particularly suspicious movements. But we can't let our guard down. Please get in for now. I'll explain as we go."

Shirone's party followed Louis. The massive carriage they had seen at Alpheas Magic School was waiting.

A man who introduced himself as Guard Captain Godin spoke up.

"I am Ruzen Godin, who will be escorting Lord Shirone, the first prince candidate. You must be anxious knowing the situation, but there's no need to worry. The kingdom has assembled the finest warriors for the escort, so you'll arrive safely at the royal castle. Please get in."

A soldier wearing a silver sword opened the carriage door.

Shirone was amazed even before entering. A crystal orb emitting light was attached to the ceiling, making the interior of the carriage as bright as midday. Moreover, it was equipped not only with beds but even facilities for meals.

"Since you are distinguished guests, this may not meet your standards, but please bear with us. We'll escort you to the royal castle shortly."

As soon as Shirone boarded the carriage, he tried lying on the bed. Though it was a bed he lay on every day, it felt unfamiliar just because it was inside a carriage.

"Haha! Amy, this is really fun."

Amy also sat on the opposite bed and smiled.

"It's called a house carriage. It even has shock-absorbing devices, so it can easily handle journeys of about 10 hours. The maintenance costs are supposedly enormous, but royalty is indeed different."

Reina said, "But the travel speed inevitably drops. It might actually be safer to arrive quickly. Anyway, we need to be fully prepared on our side too."

Amy raised her hand.

"I'll stand night watch. Mages can stay awake for about a day without problems."

Shirone shook his head.

"No, then let's take turns together."

"It's fine. You'll be hectic as soon as we arrive, so rest up now while you can."

Even with escorts present, they couldn't let their guard down. Someone had to watch over the party. Amy thought she was the right person for the job. Having Shirone's parents stay up all night didn't make sense.

Reina frowned as if displeased.

"What, are you ignoring me? I can do Schema too! When I was taking apprentice lessons, I'd stay up for several nights. Rather, let's have the three of us take turns. Since we don't know the situation at the royal castle, it wouldn't be good to have one person get tired first."

Amy thought that made sense and followed without complaint. Vincent and Olina asked to be included too, but ordinary people couldn't stay up all night while riding a carriage for 24 hours.

"Please rest well. Getting tired from the start would be more of a loss."

Vincent and Olina had no choice but to lie on their beds. But since there's no beating fatigue, they fell asleep quickly.

The remaining bed was to be used by the three of them in turns.

Reina and Amy could sleep together, but since Shirone couldn't sleep with women, he leaned against the wall to sleep.

How much time had passed?

He had fallen asleep watching Reina stand night watch, but before he knew it, Amy had come over to wake him.

"Shirone, if you're tired, should I stand watch longer?"

Shirone's eyes snapped open without any preliminary movements. His turn meant four hours had passed.

His mind was clearer than ever and his body wasn't tired either. He could understand why nobles paid expensive prices for luxurious carriages.

"No. I'm fine. You sleep some more too. Nothing happened?"

"Yeah. It's disturbingly quiet. I could listen if the soldiers said something, but they're not saying a word, probably being cautious of Schema."

Shirone nodded and moved to the center of the carriage.

"Right. Thanks, Amy."

"Don't mention it."

Amy crawled over to Reina's side to catch some brief sleep.

Then she suddenly remembered something and looked back at Shirone while lying prone.

Shirone couldn't help but laugh at her cat-like appearance.

"What? Can't sleep?"

"Well, that's part of it..."

Amy trailed off.

There had been something on her mind ever since the envoy from the Kingdom of Kasula came.

"Shirone, if you become royalty..."

Amy asked as if she had made up her mind.

"You won't learn magic or anything like that, right?"

"Huh?"

"Think about it. From then on, you'll be the first prince. You'll naturally have to take successor lessons, and then you won't have time to learn magic."

Shirone chuckled.

Had she been thinking about that all this time?

Well, lately he'd been too busy looking after himself to pay attention to what others were thinking.

"Amy, I'm not going to become a prince."

Amy's eyes widened.

"What are you talking about? Don't tell me you're planning to run away?"

"If that's the last resort, then I'll have to run. But I'll try to persuade them so it doesn't come to that. Even if they're the ones who gave birth to me, I only have two parents. The reason I'm going to the royal castle isn't to become a successor. It's to convey my intentions. I'll return home, attend magic school, and..."

Shirone hesitated for a moment, then gathered courage to speak.

"I'll definitely keep the promise I made with you too."

"Shirone..."

Amy was moved, but at the same time worried.

Until now, Shirone had navigated life according to his beliefs and it had worked, but this time the opponent was different.

Royalty isn't as rational as Shirone thinks, nor are they swayed by emotions.

Royalty are intuitive beings.

Those who hold and shake the world in their hands think only in simple judgments of whether to do something or not.

But when it reaches the level of a king, this evolves excellently, so those simple choices can either advance or regress history.

It would be completely impossible to change such a person's way of thinking with words.

Nevertheless, Amy said nothing.

She wanted to keep the lingering feeling of Shirone's last words trapped in the carriage for as long as possible.

"See you later, Shirone."

Amy lay down next to Reina for a brief sleep.

@

Reina woke everyone with a whispered voice.

"Wake up. We seem to have arrived at the royal castle."

Amy rubbed her sleepy eyes and got up. Looking through the gap in the window outside, it was still before dawn.

But the carriage no longer shook, and the sound of hoofbeats was clear as they traveled on stone-paved roads.

Shirone opened the window and looked outside. It was too dark to see clearly, but buildings were passing by. They had entered a city. However, not a single house had lights on.

A mounted soldier approached and spoke to Shirone.

"I'm sorry. We're on night patrol, so you can't look outside. I'll close the window."

The guard closed the window with a sharp sound.

Shirone clicked his tongue and turned around. Reina and Amy also looked dumbfounded.

Amy pouted her lips.

"Tch! Now that we're entering the royal castle, people suddenly change."

"We can't jump to conclusions. It's the first time that person has spoken to us. It's a matter to judge carefully."

Shirone also thought Reina's way of thinking was right.

From now on, it was walking a tightrope. Minor misunderstandings or mistakes could put everyone in danger.

Dawn broke as they entered the inner castle. An escort soldier knocked on the carriage and informed them they could look around freely.

Shirone felt the foreignness of another country. At night, going outside, let alone spying, seemed to require permission.

'It's definitely more rigid than Tormia. I need to keep thinking.'

The carriage crossed the large moat surrounding the royal castle and entered the inner castle.

Kasula Royal Castle wasn't as beautiful as the buildings of heaven, but its scale was enormous.

About halfway across the bridge, fanfares began to sound.

A military band appeared, and all the lower officials of the royal castle came out clapping to welcome them.

At the unexpected welcome, Shirone looked back at Reina.

"What's going on?"

"I know. I didn't think they'd welcome us so openly."

Even Reina thought it was definitely strange.

If it was the Kingdom of Kasula that had grown under Theraze's protection, then Shirone's existence would surely be a thorn in the side of the empress's faction.

'Yet there was no assassination, let alone any other incidents. Plus this level of welcome...'

Realistically, there were about two possibilities.

Either Orcampf's side was also staking their lives on Shirone's matter, or conversely, Theraze's side didn't care at all.

Both the former and latter were possible, so she couldn't determine which was more certain.

She observed Shirone's expression, but he was calm.

Even though this situation should be most tense for him, once they arrived at the royal castle, the anxiety from departure had completely disappeared. This was also Shirone's strength that Reina had admired.

It had been the same at the Ozent family. Usually an innocent boy like any his age, but when danger struck, he became eerily calm.

'Well... now he's the kingdom's top magic school aspirant.'

Shirone's essence remained the same, but everything that made him up was different from before. Having read Shirone's article in Spirit magazine, Reina had asked a mage she knew what an Unlocker was.

They said it was the most immense mental state a human could reach.

Knowing that fact, she could no longer see Shirone as merely young as before.

Kasula Castle was a building covering about 20,000 pyeong, with approximately 1,000 permanent residents.

Rather than splendor, it had a combative design, which made its entrance narrower than most castles.

But once inside, a grand hall so massive it naturally evoked thoughts of a royal castle unfolded.

High officials stood according to seniority along the red carpet, and beyond that, stairs led to a throne where Orcampf IV sat.

It wasn't proper etiquette to look directly at the king's face, but Shirone's party couldn't take their eyes off him.

He had the same golden hair as Shirone and a refined appearance hard to believe belonged to a nation's ruler. But the aura emanating from his body was extraordinary.

No matter how much of a king, he was just another person under the sky, but someone who held millions of lives was definitely different somehow.

'That person is...'

Placing Orcampf and Shirone side by side, one could easily think them father and son.

It wasn't a cookie-cutter resemblance, but they had been separated for 18 years, so environmental differences had to be considered.

Shirone's party performed the ceremony according to protocol.

But Orcampf showed no reaction, only staring intently at Shirone's face.

"Raise your head."

Shirone met Orcampf's eyes.

The king's gaze drew him in and shook his heart. It was the aura of a monarch that couldn't be felt from swordsmen or mages.

But he soon gathered his wits and returned to a calm state. It was the realm of the Diamond Body, unshaken by others' will.

Then Orcampf's eyes lit up as if surprised.

'Indeed, is this my son...'
