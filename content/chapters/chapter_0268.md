Orcamp raised his hand to welcome them.

"You must have had a difficult journey traveling such a long way. Shirone, I assume you know why you've come here?"

"Yes, I do."

"Good. Let's arrange a separate place to discuss the details. It must have been an exhausting journey, so provide them with rooms and serve them food."

The chamberlain in charge of the palace's minor affairs bowed his head.

"Understood, Your Majesty."

Shirone raised his head again to look at Orcamp.

This was the reunion between father and son after 18 years. However, he couldn't hear any personal words from him.

Was this what it meant to be a king? Once one took on the position of king, could they not even reveal their personal emotions?

Perhaps he already had no feelings for the son he had abandoned.

If he had truly loved his child, he wouldn't have abandoned him no matter what difficulties arose.

But he had abandoned him, and so many years had passed.

He didn't know for what reason he had been summoned, but perhaps it was something that didn't need to be sought out in the first place.

Shirone's party followed the chamberlain out of the Grand Hall with empty hearts.

The Great Chamber where guests stayed had two people per room.

Vincent and his wife used one room, and Amy and Reina used another.

However, the chamberlain did not provide a room for Shirone.

"Lord Shirone will stay in the inner quarters with His Majesty's family members."

Amy stepped forward with a surprised expression.

"We weren't told anything about this?"

It was dangerous to leave Shirone alone in the royal palace where unknown conspiracies might be lurking.

But the chamberlain looked at Amy as if she were strange.

"That's only natural. Lord Shirone is someone who will become royalty."

"The conclusion hasn't been definitively reached yet."

The chamberlain frowned.

Such circumstances were not something a mere servant could know about.

According to rumors he had heard, the verification of the First Prince was merely a formal procedure, so he didn't understand why they were acting this way.

Also, he had heard that Shirone was a commoner. If such a blessing had come to him, he would have prostrated himself before God in gratitude.

Yet these people's expressions showed not good feelings but some inexplicable discomfort.

"What's the matter?"

Administrative executive Ordos approached.

The chamberlain hurriedly bowed his head and explained Shirone's party's complaints.

Ordos was also displeased, but he didn't think it was an unusual situation. If they had any brains, they would have grasped the political situation in Kasula before coming.

Ordos turned to Shirone and said, "There are protocols in the royal palace. Just changing a royal's room would cause much commotion. However, if it makes you that uncomfortable, I'll make a suggestion."

Shirone, not wanting to cause problems immediately after entering the palace, shook his head.

While it was true that he was wary of dangerous situations, he still wanted to believe that his birth parents wouldn't harm him.

If even that wasn't true... then even if the same blood flowed through them, wouldn't there be no reason to stay here?

"I understand. I'll go to the inner quarters. I can see everyone at meal times, right?"

Ordos shook his head.

"At meal times, there will be separate seating arrangements. Commoners cannot intrude on royal meal times."

Shirone frowned.

Vincent and Olina were his benefactors and only parents who had raised him for 18 years.

Even if he was of royal blood, he had no desire to deny that fact.

Come to think of it, the people from Kasula's side had never once expressed gratitude to Vincent and Olina.

Perhaps they thought they hadn't abandoned their child but had merely left him in their care temporarily.

Just as subjects follow when the king commands, they clearly took Vincent and Olina's good deeds for granted.

Shirone could not tolerate that.

If his parents were to be treated with such contempt, he wouldn't mind returning home right now.

"That's unacceptable. Please let us eat together."

"Sh-Shirone... we're fine."

Vincent said with a pale face.

Having been troubled by nobles, let alone royalty, his entire life, he knew how dangerous Shirone's statement was.

But Shirone didn't back down.

If any type of conflict had to occur, now was the most advantageous time to push through his intentions.

"No. Then I won't attend either. My parents must be seated together at meal time."

Ordos pressed his lips together and fell into thought.

What a bold child. Did he think he already possessed everything just because he was designated as the First Prince?

Of course, he would become a prince, but that didn't mean the power structure would change.

In the palace, there was the son of Theraze, the existing First Prince.

When his thoughts reached that point, he was newly puzzled.

Despite the grand announcement of bringing Eliza's biological child, Theraze's side showed no movement whatsoever.

They might be that confident, or it could be silent pressure for the forces they had planted in Kasula to act on their own.

The Empress's power was formidable. Until now, there had been no way to oppose her, so factions hadn't really divided, but from now on, it was time to choose sides carefully.

However, Ordos was skeptical.

They said he had distinguished himself at magic school, but with just that level of credentials, he wasn't an opponent to challenge Theraze's children.

"I understand Lord Shirone's words, but this isn't something I can decide. It goes against protocol and could potentially become a national incident. So, forgive me, but how about appealing directly to His Majesty?"

Shirone nodded as if he had nothing to fear.

"Fine. I'll speak to him directly."

"Then let's go. I'll guide you to the inner quarters."

Shirone, following behind Ordos, turned back and said, "I'll be back. See you later."

Reina watched Shirone disappearing into the distance.

Was he really planning to bring Vincent and Olina to the royal dining table?

Royal etiquette ranked higher than national law. Due to the nature of monarchical states, if the king's authority was insulted, the country would shake.

The current decision would certainly bring danger in some way.

Olina grabbed Reina's collar and pleaded.

"We're really fine. I think it would be better to stop Shirone. Even if I wanted to say something, I don't know anything..."

It wasn't just because Olina's knowledge was limited.

Reina also couldn't understand what Shirone was thinking with such behavior.

"It's strange. He's not the type to be stubborn."

"Shirone has already started fighting."

Reina turned to Amy and asked back, "Fighting?"

Amy recalled the conversation she had with Shirone and said, "The reason Shirone accepted the royal palace's invitation was because he wanted to meet his birth parents. But Shirone has no interest in being a successor or prince. He'll return to magic school and live with his family. Of course, that family means these two people here. That's why he can't compromise. If he takes one step back here, he'll end up being manipulated until the end. Shirone chose the royal dining table as the point to gain strategic advantage."

"Our son..."

Olina's eyes welled up with tears.

What inadequate parents they were. In this situation, instead of protecting their son, they were actually being looked after by him.

In truth, she wanted to fight too. King or whatever, she wanted to assert to his face that since she raised him, he was her child.

But she couldn't do so not because she lacked courage.

They were royalty. And Shirone was trying to become a prince of a nation.

Vincent wrapped his arm around Olina's shoulder and said, "Let's watch. He's our son. He's a child with deep thoughts. We just need to follow whatever that child says."

Olina wiped her tears and nodded.

**The Theraze Bloodline (1)**

Shirone entered the inner quarters where royalty resided.

Like another castle within the castle, a completely different scene unfolded from the previous landscape.

Portraits of royalty hung on walls decorated with brilliant golden wallpaper, and luxurious carpets were laid on the floor.

Shirone headed to Orcamp's room. Located at the very end of the castle, it wasn't difficult to find.

Upon entering the study, Orcamp was sitting at his desk, lost in thought. Only after a long while did he realize Shirone had arrived and stood up, saying, "You've come?"

His tone was more emotional than in the Grand Hall, but the initial awkwardness still remained.

"Come this way. Your mother is waiting."

The mother would be Kasula's queen, Orcamp Eliza. Orcamp only said those words and didn't speak a single word on the way. Shirone was so nervous that he couldn't even recognize this fact. It was finally the moment to meet the mother who had given birth to him.

Eliza's room was luxurious and splendid enough to be declared the most extravagant space in the Kingdom of Kasula. In the enormous room lay a pure white bed large enough for ten people, and upon it sat a woman even paler than the bed itself.

There was no law saying a nation's queen had to be beautiful, but she was beautiful, and her large eyes held sadness.

"Ahh..."

Eliza was so overcome with emotion that she couldn't continue speaking.

Rising from the bed, she embraced Shirone without saying any of the words she had initially prepared.

Shirone just stood there. He thought he should embrace her back, but for some reason, he couldn't move a single fingertip.

A pleasant fragrance emanated from her body. It was a very refined and precious royal fragrance that Shirone had never smelled before.

But it wasn't Olina's scent.

"My son, you've finally come. Mother is sorry...! Please forgive your mother!"

At Eliza's sobbing voice, Shirone's throat also tightened.

When he was young, he had resented the parents who abandoned him. But Vincent and Olina had filled the irreplaceable emptiness of blood ties with enormous love.

That's why he felt guilty. The fact that he couldn't speak kind words to Eliza was also unfamiliar to himself.

"Outside... there are the parents who raised me."

Eliza pulled back and examined Shirone's face.

He was truly a beautiful boy. This too was her own, and Orcamp's noble bloodline.

"Yes, but not anymore. I am your mother. You will become the First Prince and inherit the kingdom. Don't worry about anything. From now on, mother will protect you."

Shirone felt suffocated.

He didn't yet know what emotion was making him angry, but for the first time, he regretted coming here.

"I want to eat with them. I know it goes against the kingdom's protocol, but I think they deserve such treatment."

Eliza made a puzzled expression and turned to her husband.

Orcamp was also disappointed by Shirone's words. What importance could mountain folk caregivers have to someone who would become king of a nation?

Orcamp suspected whether Shirone lacked the qualities of a successor, then shook his head.

If he was of Orcamp's bloodline, that couldn't be the case.

It was just that because he had grown up in a different environment, he hadn't yet awakened his imperial temperament.

Shirone had to become the First Prince. That was the only way to oppose Theraze's forces.

Orcamp showed his displeasure and said, "Must you really do that? Meals are basically shared among family. I don't like uninvited guests intruding. I'll give separate instructions to treat them well so they won't feel slighted."

Shirone firmly shook his head. And he glared at Eliza with sharp eyes.

So this was what it came down to? Was one meal's protocol more important than the effort of raising a son? Was that why they abandoned him like a worn-out shoe when crisis came to the kingdom?

Eliza read the disappointment and frustration in Shirone's eyes and hurriedly changed her mind. When they abandoned Shirone, she had agreed too, but it was entirely for her husband Orcamp's circumstances.

What mother in the world would want to abandon her child? She, who had suffered from guilt her entire life, could grant Shirone anything he asked for.

"If you want it, we'll do so. Since they took care of you, that much is nothing. Of course, if our son wants it."

Eliza seemed moved by her own words and again became emotional, pulling Shirone into an embrace.
