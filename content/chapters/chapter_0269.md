Surprisingly, permission was granted easily, but Shirone had anticipated this situation from the beginning.

Those who possess wealth and power are naturally free. It was the same when the Ozent family risked their lives working on the Great Library relocation project.

The butlers meticulously classified books according to strict rules, but in reality, the nobles didn't even care whether books went missing or not.

Eliza hugged Shirone and kept repeating something, but no sound reached Shirone's mind as he was lost in thought.

Suddenly, Eliza remembered something and jumped up.

"This won't do. I can't be dressed like this for my first meal with my son. Dear, I'm going to change my clothes."

"Please do so."

Eliza left Shirone behind and walked to the dressing room. The female attendants then followed her in formation.

Shirone didn't think clothes were particularly important for eating. But just as noble parties had dress codes, for royalty, choosing clothes seemed to be as important as finding a son after eighteen years.

After Eliza left, only Orkamp and Shirone remained. An awkward silence followed with no words exchanged. Whether he had been thinking about it from the beginning or couldn't overcome the awkwardness, Orkamp spoke first.

"Shirone... was it?"

"Yes. It's the name my parents gave me."

Shirone emphasized that his parents had given him this name. Orkamp might have a name for him as well, but Shirone didn't want to abandon the name Shirone.

"I see. It's a good name."

Contrary to expectations, Orkamp didn't say anything particular.

Shirone thought that perhaps there had never been a name assigned to him from the beginning. If so, it meant they had already decided to abandon their child while he was still growing in his mother's womb.

"Do you resent me?"

"I did when I was young. But now..."

Shirone swallowed the words that were about to follow. Saying that he was rather fortunate to have been born as Vincent's son seemed too rude.

Orkamp read Shirone's emotions with his characteristic insight and smiled bitterly.

"Now you don't, I suppose."

"That's..."

"I understand. Being royalty may look glamorous, but it's not such a good position. There are many things to be responsible for, many things to give up."

"Like how you gave me up."

At Shirone's pointed question, Orkamp was momentarily flustered but soon returned to a calm expression.

"I'm sorry. Not being able to find you was..."

Shirone shook his head to stop Orkamp's words.

He didn't want to hear it.

No, actually he wanted to hear it. But the words that would come from his mouth wouldn't be the answer he expected. He was certain of that.

"It's fine. You found me now, didn't you?"

Orkamp felt Shirone's extraordinariness firsthand. Despite living as a commoner for eighteen years, there wasn't the slightest sign of nervousness within the royal palace of a foreign country. Moreover, he was someone with a strong spirit who could push through his demands even when facing the king and queen.

'Indeed... blood doesn't run thin, does it?'

Having reached this conclusion, Orkamp turned toward his study to proceed to the next stage. But then, suddenly thinking that Shirone would be left alone, he turned back and asked.

"Dinner is in thirty minutes. Will you stay here?"

Shirone shook his head. He felt like he would suffocate to death if he stayed in this room even one more minute.

"No. I'll go out. May I tour the royal palace?"

This request was pure curiosity without any calculation behind it. For a mere commoner, or even a noble, being invited to the royal palace was a great honor. Setting aside matters of honor, it was a good opportunity to tour the royal palace he had been curious about since childhood.

Orkamp readily agreed.

"Of course. You may tour anywhere. After all, this place will become your home now."

Shirone was thinking of returning to magic school. But bringing up such talk at this moment was premature, so he simply expressed gratitude for Orkamp's kindness and left the room.

Shirone walked down the corridor with an excited feeling. Where should he visit first? The armory, bakery, chapel - anywhere would be fine, but what appealed to him most was the gallery where various artworks were displayed.

When he saw an elderly steward standing at the corner of the corridor, Shirone approached him to ask for directions. But before he could say anything, the steward bowed his head first.

"Lord Shirone, there is someone who wishes to meet you."

Shirone felt annoyed the moment he heard the steward's words.

Normally he would have followed without complaint, but he was feeling fatigued by the royal family's autocratic and self-centered way of thinking, so he didn't like this situation.

"Later. I want to be alone right now. His Majesty also said I could go anywhere until dinner time."

Though Shirone didn't know the steward's position, he openly showed his displeasure. Having spoken his mind even before the king, there seemed no need to be mindful of a mere steward's feelings.

But the unidentified steward spoke with a cunning smile, as if Shirone would ultimately have no choice but to follow his words.

"Of course that's fine, but wouldn't it be better if you met with them?"

Reading an ominous feeling from the steward's smile, Shirone set aside his annoyed emotions and regained his composure. It was clearly a threat. That made him curious as well. There wasn't much time left until dinner. Was there a reason to seek him out so urgently?

"Who is this person?"

A sharp glint flashed through the steward's eyes.

"It is Lord Theraze Zion. The first prince of Kasula. For now, at least."

The steward emphasized "for now, at least." It meant the position of first prince would change hands in the future, but somehow it carried a nuance that suggested the opposite interpretation.

Shirone became cautious at the name Zion. The target he should be most wary of in the royal palace was undoubtedly the Theraze faction. The core of that faction had requested a meeting first.

In Shirone's thinking, it would be better to meet as soon as possible to confirm what kind of person he was. Knowing someone's disposition allows you to roughly deduce how they will move. Zion probably had the same thought, which is why he sent the steward.

"Fine, let's meet."

"An excellent decision. Please come this way."

The steward led Shirone toward the eastern part of the inner palace.

It was where the royal family's apartments were located - smaller in scale than the inner palace where Orkamp stayed, but sufficiently luxurious.

In the hall that divided the wings, there was a lion sculpture reaching to the ceiling, with four paths extending north, south, east, and west from there.

After advancing twenty meters eastward, a door decorated with gold awaited Shirone. When the steward opened it from outside, an artificial garden with white marble flooring appeared.

Before entering, Shirone surveyed the interior.

The garden was beautiful, but it provided optimal conditions for plotting something. Though it was winter, palm trees that evoked a southern atmosphere were planted.

At the central table, siblings younger than Shirone were drinking tea, and on the floor, a sleek black cat and a fluffy white cat were playing and teasing each other.

"Lord Zion, I have brought Lord Shirone."

Zion was watching the cats play when he heard the steward's words and slightly raised his head without turning his gaze.

"Tell him to come in."

When the order was given, the steward made a sinister smile and gestured for Shirone to enter.

Shirone pulled his chin up and walked in upright.

If he was looked down upon from the start, all strategies would be ruined. The sound of the unidentified steward closing the door and leaving was strangely ominous.

Walking to the table, Shirone ignored manners and examined the siblings' faces with intense eyes.

'So these are...'

Theraze Zion and Theraze Uorin.

The current first prince and princess of Kasula.

They were, of course, Orkamp's children. But their surname followed their mother Theraze's. The reason was simple. Orkamp had lost in the power game of political marriage. Society called this Orkamp's humiliation.

Only then did Zion turn his head to look up at Shirone. Then, finding Shirone's serious face amusing, he joked around.

"Haha! Don't be so tense. I won't eat you."

Shirone didn't know what Empress Theraze of Kashan looked like. But if he removed Orkamp's features from Zion's face, he felt he could vaguely understand the empress's appearance.

He was a beautiful boy with cold silver hair, deep double eyelids, and a cat-like sharp jaw line. From that alone, it was easy to imagine that Theraze's beauty was beyond imagination.

Uorin smiled and welcomed Shirone.

"Hello, I'm Uorin. You're a mage, right, big brother? I saw you in that magazine."

The white cat jumped onto Uorin's lap. Shirone couldn't take his eyes off the fourteen-year-old girl who was hugging the cat and stroking its fur.

If he had inferred Theraze through Zion's appearance, Uorin felt like she clearly revealed what kind of person Theraze was.

She resembled Theraze much more than Zion. No, to be precise, it seemed as if Orkamp's blood was hardly mixed in at all.

She was a beautiful girl, and beyond that beauty, she had an appearance that conveyed some kind of spiritual mystique.

Shirone had experienced similar emotions before. He never expected to feel again in a human the same feeling he had when first seeing Ikael in heaven.

Uorin slightly bowed her head and looked up at Shirone with anxious eyes.

"Why, why are you looking at me like that? We'll be family in a few days, but that kind of gaze is burdensome."

Shirone's face flushed bright red.

"No, I didn't mean it that way..."

As if nothing had happened, Uorin clutched her stomach and laughed.

"Hohoho! I'm joking, joking! I heard you're eighteen, but you're really innocent. Don't be like that and come sit over here."

Shirone collected himself and sat in the seat Uorin offered. He had almost lost the initiative, but this was just the beginning.

A servant brought tea and a full conversation ensued.

Contrary to expectations that a fierce psychological battle would begin, Zion was optimistic about the current situation.

This was possible because he was looking down on Shirone.

"If you're not an idiot, you'll understand the palace situation. And the weight that the surname Theraze carries. I called you here to end this cleanly. I don't know what father was thinking when he found you, but you can't become king anyway. So it would be better not to walk around with your head held so high."

Openly urging the first prince candidate to give up was tantamount to an official declaration of intent to aim for the throne.

Having devoured history books, Shirone knew exactly how bloody royal family blood feuds unfolded.

But this time, he was rather grateful that Zion came out like this. He had no interest in royal power from the beginning.

"Don't worry. I only came because I was invited. I'll return when this is over. I have no desire to live here. No thoughts of becoming king either."

"Hahaha! You speak well. Usually cunning bastards say that and then stab you in the back, right? Truly like a despicable mage. Oh wait! You're not even a mage, are you? A mage aspirant."

Uorin scolded Zion.

"Brother, don't be like that. Shirone had an unfortunate childhood. A commoner entering magic school is really amazing. And now he's evaluated as a tremendous prospect."

Uorin was favorable toward Shirone, opposite to Zion.

But from Shirone's perspective, she felt like a more dangerous element than Zion's overt hostility.

Uorin was also Theraze's daughter. There was no reason at all for her to be kind to him.

Uorin spoke with a pretty smile.

"It seems Shirone is still wary of us. This is all because of brother Zion. Ah, is it okay if I call you big brother?"

Shirone couldn't adapt to the atmosphere here.

The Theraze siblings had completely opposite dispositions, like going between heaven and hell. Trying to pay attention to both at once made his head spin in confusion.

"Well, nothing's been decided for certain yet. I suppose it's okay though?"

"Aw, what does it matter? I'll just call you big brother. You're older than me anyway. But big brother, do you cast magic and stuff?"

"Magic? Uh, basic things, sure."

Uorin clapped and was delighted.

"Wow! Exciting! You have to show me later! Magic is amazing every time I see it. How can fire come out of your hand?"

Shirone was increasingly caught up in a strange feeling.

He couldn't find any strategic feeling in Uorin's attitude. He even began to think she might simply be a kind and innocent girl.

But if she were a mountain village girl, that would be one thing - as the empress's daughter, her mind would be superior to others, not inferior.

Shirone suddenly discovered something the siblings had in common.

They weren't afraid of anything.

Both Zion's overt hostility and Uorin's inappropriately friendly attitude for the situation were possible because they had the enormous power of Theraze backing them.
