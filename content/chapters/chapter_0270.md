Woorin glanced at the wall clock, then hurriedly set down the cat and stood up from her seat.

"Oh? It's time to eat. Brother, let's go."

Zion set down his teacup, stood up, and leaned his face close to Shirone's.

"I don't know what thoughts brought you here, but it would be best not to expect too much. If you don't want to get hurt, that is."

Shirone didn't even snort in response.

"Let me be clear—I'm not expecting anything at all. The only reason I came here is because I wanted to meet my birth parents."

"Haha! Birth parents? Yes, that's important. But you know what? Do you think parents who abandoned their child once won't abandon them a second time?"

Shirone frowned, not understanding.

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"How pathetic. When it comes to power, there's no such thing as blood relations or anything else. You don't really think Father suddenly started looking for you for no reason, do you?"

Shirone had also expected that there must be some reason why they had sought him out after eighteen years. But hearing such words directly from Zion was shocking.

Woorin tapped Zion's shoulder.

"Come on! Let's go quickly. We'll get scolded if we're late."

Zion sneered at Shirone and was led out of the room by his sister's hand.

Only after leaving the room and abandoning Shirone alone did Zion finally look back and click his tongue.

"Tch! What an annoying bastard. I especially don't like his eyes. Is it because he lived so basely? He should be trembling in fear, but where does he get off talking back so boldly?"

Woorin soothed Zion.

"Don't be so harsh. I'm happy to have a mage brother. Besides, he can't possibly be your competitor anyway. As long as Mother is here, the Kingdom of Kasula belongs to you, brother."

"Who doesn't know that? It's just that I don't like what he's doing. I don't even want to call him Father. That bastard Orcamp. When I become king, I'll definitely get rid of him."

Woorin pursed her lips.

In any country, the idea of a son killing his father would be considered treasonous. Moreover, this was the royal palace. If these words leaked outside, the kingdom would be turned upside down.

But Woorin's reaction was merely that—nothing more.

They were children of Theraze.

The food that appeared on the royal dining table was so grand that commoners couldn't even dream of it in their wildest fantasies of dying from overeating.

Shirone thought there was no need to spend so much money on daily meals, but in reality, indulging in luxury even when no one would eat was a virtue of the royal family.

Royalty had to be superior to nobility in even the smallest things.

As long as the world's nobles engaged in all manner of luxury, the royal family's ridiculously excessive spending would never be corrected.

Shirone's party sat at the lowest seats. Not only Vincent and his wife, but also Reina and Amy had pale faces.

They never imagined they would actually be invited to the king's table.

Perhaps it was the first time in the hundred-year history of the Kingdom of Kasula?

Their anxiety increased accordingly, and they didn't even know where the food was going down their throats.

The atmosphere at the dining table was utterly cold.

Orcamp was hurt in his pride by this situation that violated protocol, and both Shirone and Zion were emotionally wounded from their conversation in the room earlier.

However, Eliza was in quite a good mood. She was pleased with the clothes she had chosen in the dressing room. She wore a dress with sleeves decorated with sable fur and had chosen diamonds as accessories.

Eliza, who had been picking at her food as if trying to break it down to the molecular level, suddenly set down her utensils and smiled brightly.

"We need to decorate Shirone's room. Splendidly and magnificently. Since you resemble your father with that blonde hair, we should order some navy formal wear too. Oh, you'll need a carriage as well. We'll be quite busy for a while."

Olina's face darkened. These were all things she couldn't provide for him.

Shirone spoke with determination.

"Those things aren't necessary. What my parents who raised me all this time have given me is already enough."

"Hoho, our son is quite modest. But there's such a thing as royal dignity, so you can't live the same life as before. Let's see... yes, gold would suit you. Or perhaps sapphires?"

"Gold, jewels—those things aren't what's important. The parents here gave their best to me. That kind of love is something I could never receive anywhere else."

Eliza frowned. Where could there be anything more important than gold and jewels? Their job was to enjoy the most luxurious wealth in the kingdom. It was not a right but a duty.

She was displeased with her son who was reciting a caretaker's love when she was trying to teach him royal duties before he became the First Prince.

No, perhaps Shirone had too much sentiment. That's why he couldn't say he would live well alone while leaving his caretakers behind.

Eliza looked at Shirone's parents.

"Vincent, was it?"

Vincent hurriedly set down his utensils.

"Ah, yes! My name is Arian Vincent!"

"I shall reward you separately. Since you took such good care of our son, compensation should naturally follow. Giving money would be too heavy to carry, so dear, how about granting some land in the Cosent region?"

Orcamp replied with an uninterested expression.

"That would be good."

Shirone's anger flared up. They had come to the royal palace as requested. Vincent and Olina were anxiously worried about losing their child. In such a situation, the only gift they could give these two people was pride in having raised their child well.

He hoped these great people wearing the nameplate of royalty would just say one word—thank you for raising our son. But why was it so difficult to draw out those words?

"Wait a moment. Why do you keep speaking that way? They raised me for eighteen years. They're the parents who taught me how to live from childhood until now, taking the place of my birth parents."

Eliza's expression turned fierce. Of course, it was regrettable that they had abandoned Shirone. But she was becoming irritated because he kept taking the side of these lowly people.

"Is the compensation too small? Then we'll build a small castle on the land..."

Shirone's voice rose.

"That's not what I'm talking about! Why won't you ever say thank you?"

Eliza looked dazed. At first, she wondered if Shirone's mind was somewhat strange. Why should royalty say thank you to commoners?

Zion spoke with an uncomfortable expression.

"What are you doing so ungracefully? Do you think this is the commoners' dining table where you used to live?"

Shirone glared at Zion. Resentment welled up inside him, but his words also had some merit. If he pushed harder in a gathering of royalty, the situation could take a strange turn.

Woorin hurriedly stepped in to mediate.

"Oh my. It's because brother Shirone is such a kind person. I think brother Shirone believes emotions are more important than material things. So compensation that doesn't convey emotion is merely an exchange of objects."

At this moment, Shirone saw Woorin as a lovable younger sister. He was so grateful to her for saying what he wanted to say.

Woorin, meeting Shirone's eyes, winked at him. Then she spoke to Vincent and his wife.

"I'm sorry for being so pushy. And thank you so much for raising our big brother so wonderfully."

"Oh, no. How could I..."

Vincent trembled with overwhelming gratitude. He never dreamed in his lifetime that he would receive thanks from royalty.

Shirone's expression also softened a bit. He felt sorry, wondering if he had been misunderstanding this child named Woorin all along.

On the other hand, Reina was shocked. Woorin was a princess of the Theraze family. And the emperors of the Kashan Empire had traditionally been inherited by women bearing the Theraze name.

While Zion's limit was being king of one country, if Woorin defeated just a few competitors, she would become emperor of the Kashan Empire and rise to a position ruling the continent. Therefore, regardless of Kasula's politics, Woorin's actual power would undoubtedly be overwhelming.

For a child with such power to express gratitude to commoners was an amazing event, and from another angle, it could be seen as having the strong qualities of a supreme ruler.

As Reina expected, Woorin's statement exercised tremendous influence. When she treated Vincent and his wife with respect, even Orcamp, who had been maintaining silence, couldn't help but support her will.

"Perhaps I was thinking too much from only the royal family's perspective. We are sufficiently grateful to you both."

Vincent bowed his head again.

"Oh, no. We only did what was natural."

A subtle anger crept into the eyes of his wife, Olina. A woman's intuition could tell. Woorin's words were sincere, but Orcamp's were not.

Of course, she hadn't given birth to Shirone from her womb. But after raising him for eighteen years, he was the son who had filled her heart with love thicker than blood.

If Shirone could be happy, she would gladly send him away even if he said he was leaving with his birth parents. But despite the appearance of the best parents anyone could envy, she didn't feel good about it.

"We don't need money. We only wish for Shirone to live happily."

Shirone looked back at Olina with surprise.

Unlike just before when she had been afraid and intimidated by royal authority, her voice now carried a subtle anger.

Eliza, who had an incredible sense for such things, couldn't miss that feeling. Her face crumpled with displeasure. She could tolerate Shirone, but she couldn't stand a caretaker acting so presumptuously.

Still, she couldn't immediately drive them out because Woorin's statement was still exercising influence.

From Eliza's perspective, Theraze was the detestable family that had stolen her husband, but she wasn't foolish enough to act while ignoring the power gap. In the end, all she could do for petty revenge was speak in a condescending tone.

"Still, you will take it. I don't want you to have different thoughts later."

Olina neither affirmed nor denied, just lowered her head. But her gaze remained fixed straight on Eliza.

Thinking things would head toward the worst at this rate, Shirone decided to bring up the core issue at this point.

"Actually, there's something I want to say."

Eliza, perhaps feeling the need to change the atmosphere, switched emotions embarrassingly quickly and smiled with her eyes.

"Yes, say anything. Mother will listen to whatever it is."

This made Olina feel even worse. Eliza's words contained mockery—that no matter how much you act like a mother, Shirone is royalty.

"I have no intention of becoming the heir to the Kingdom of Kasula. I've already finished discussing this matter with Zion. So please let me stay for a while and then return to Tormia."

Everyone's utensils stopped at once. Orcamp's face turned serious, and Eliza gaped as if her soul had left her.

"What are you saying, Shirone? This is your home now. There's no need to return to such a shabby place."

"I want to go back. No, at least let me graduate from the school I'm currently attending."

Shirone first presented the magic school card. Honestly, he wanted to leave the royal palace just like this, but that could put his family in danger.

"No! That's absolutely unacceptable! You're a prince who inherited royal blood! If it's a magic school, there are plenty in Kasula too! I'll introduce you to the best teachers."

"I'll take the graduation exam next year. This is the most important time for me right now. Please give me just one year."

Of course, he had no intention of returning after a year. Once he safely escaped from here, he planned to graduate from magic school and run away with his parents.

Woorin once again supported Shirone.

"I understand brother Shirone's feelings. He must have friends at school too. Managing connections is important."

"What connections with nobles? You should associate with royalty."

Eliza was absolutely opposed. How could she send away the son she had finally found? Above all, it drove her crazy with wounded pride that her qualifications as a mother were being pushed aside by these lowly people.

After long consideration, Orcamp opened his mouth.

"I shall consider it."

"Dear!"

Eliza snapped fiercely. But feeling the cold energy in her husband's eyes, she quickly shut her mouth.

Orcamp also thought it was ridiculous to hand his son over to a woodcutter. It was a disgrace to the royal family. But a child of Theraze was present. If he held onto the departing Shirone, he could earn undue suspicion from the Theraze faction.

Reina finally realized Shirone's strategy.

That the Theraze faction was the most dangerous also meant they were the most powerful. Rather than opposing them, his idea was to use their power in reverse to achieve his goal.

'He really is smart.'

At first she was worried because he seemed too excited, but as expected, Shirone wasn't one to jump into a fight with no chance of winning.

Seating his parents at the royal dining table, deliberately bringing up leaving in such a setting—these were all decisions he could make because the Theraze children were participating.

In the end, Orcamp had no choice but to step back.

"Shirone, all circumstances indicate that you are my son. Of course, I believe so as well. But the verification hasn't been completed clearly yet."

This meant concrete evidence was needed. Usually not something to bring up in such a situation, but Shirone had already expected it. Through this statement, he could reassure the Theraze faction.

"So how about this? Verifying the First Prince must proceed through proper procedures. We'll conduct a paternity test. If we start tomorrow, it will take about four days for the results. Let's think of a good solution by then."

Shirone didn't like dragging out time, but it had been impossible from the start to settle things decisively with royalty in one stroke.

"Alright. I'll also think about it carefully."

Countless dishes appeared on the royal dining table, but no one remembered that day's menu.
