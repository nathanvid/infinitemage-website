title: Theraze's Bloodline (4)

Even past midnight, Orcamp couldn't bring himself to leave his study. Sitting at his desk with his face buried in his hands, he replayed every conversation from today's dinner table, sentence by sentence.

Had he misspoken? Had he provoked Theraze? What variables might his words create in the future?

This daily ritual of reviewing his words was utterly exhausting and draining work.

But there could be no mistakes.

Until he could get his hands on a card capable of opposing the Empress, he had no choice but to be cautious and then cautious again.

A voice came from behind Orcamp.

"You summoned me, Your Majesty."

A man in his mid-thirties emerged from the veil of darkness. His slender eyes seemed to be smiling, and he was an effeminate man wearing seven piercings along his earlobes.

Morrigan Arius.

A mage known by the nickname "Grave Robber" in society, and an Unlocker who had opened the Immortal Function.

As one of the Seven Demon Mages belonging to the Black Line, he had been scouted by the Kingdom of Kasula five years ago after his Scale Magic abilities were recognized.

Unlike the Red Line, the Black Line had no association and therefore no rankings or hierarchy.

While some formed organizations like the Seven Demon Mages, it was also common for individuals like Grave Robber Arius to operate independently. Moreover, the majority were criminals pursued by nations.

There were mages who caused trouble in the Red Line and crossed over to the Black Line, but those couldn't even be considered part of the group - it was a line teeming with those who committed mass slaughter.

Anyone with a somewhat known name had bounties starting in the hundreds of millions, which was why there were even guilds in the Red Line that specialized in hunting only Black Line members.

Nations involved with the Black Line faced external criticism, but considering Kasula's political situation, it was unavoidable.

Even though the civil war had ended through a political marriage with Theraze, there were still many politically unstable elements.

First, neighboring countries wouldn't simply let Kasula grow, and internally, they had to watch out for the Theraze faction as well.

With foreign interference making it difficult to strengthen Red Line forces, it was natural for Orcamp to extend his hand to the Black Line.

"How did the task I assigned go?"

"It was resolved successfully. Most of the classified information has been siphoned off. Theraze probably won't notice."

"I see."

"Now it's time to move to the next stage. From what I've observed, he's decent material. Truly Your Majesty's son, I'd say?"

Orcamp felt self-loathing and sighed. When he had ruthlessly abandoned his son, when was that? Now that he had found a way to use him, bringing him back seemed ridiculous.

Arius smiled like a snake as he offered comfort.

"Don't worry. It's not like we're going to kill him. There won't be any problems."

"That child... said he wants to leave the royal castle."

Arius's slender eyes opened slightly. A sharp flash like starlight flickered in his revealed pupils.

"I see. Well, Unlockers aren't particularly interested in worldly affairs. They're the type who wander around looking only for strange things, mysterious things, things beyond their grasp."

"Like you?"

Arius's nickname was Grave Robber. But what he robbed wasn't gold or jewels.

"Well, I suppose it's similar. Anyway, nothing will change. Shirone isn't what's important - Ataraxia is what matters."

Orcamp's expression twisted. Why that child, of all people? No, this was definitely an opportunity. If he missed this chance now, he would never be able to escape from Theraze's grasp.

Orcamp couldn't forget the moments of humiliation he'd suffered like a male courtesan after marrying Theraze. He had nightmares every night and regularly woke up drenched in cold sweat.

She had trampled a human being's spirit to the very bottom, then left like the wind after planting only two obstacles named Zion and Woorin.

Theraze had plans to devour the world.

One of the core projects was Valkyrie, a multinational army organized to oppose Heaven.

The army, with 24 countries participating, was large enough to finish off a small kingdom in just three days, and Theraze was the commander of that Valkyrie.

The reason the Kingdom of Kasula had grown rapidly over the past 20 years was also thanks to receiving a portion of Valkyrie's shares.

But Orcamp didn't believe the kingdom's growth would last long. Zion was growing up well. And his surname was Theraze, not Orcamp.

Eventually, Theraze would devour Kasula. Just as she had devoured him long ago.

Then one day, intelligence arrived. News that a student at a magic school in the Kingdom of Tormia had used Heaven's power.

They immediately began investigating, and a shocking fact was revealed. That child was Shirone, whom he had abandoned 18 years ago.

Orcamp felt like Heaven was helping him.

Even within Valkyrie, the army opposing Heaven, only a very few could wield Heaven's power.

According to experts, Ataraxia was an archangel's ability that belonged to Triple S in terms of power classification.

Throughout past and present, not a single person in Valkyrie could wield Triple S abilities.

And that Shirone was his bloodline. If he could only elevate Shirone to First Prince, he would have a weapon to oppose Theraze.

Not only would his position within Valkyrie be strengthened, but there was also a real possibility of driving out Theraze's bloodline from Kasula's royal castle.

Having finally made his decision, Orcamp asked.

"Can you replicate Ataraxia?"

"It's my specialty. Leave it to me."

"I don't want to hurt that child. I hope he can live the life he wants."

Of course, it was a lie.

The only reason he had summoned Shirone was to use Ataraxia's power to keep Theraze in check.

In that sense, the existence of Orcamp's bloodline was also a risk factor that could incur Theraze's wrath.

Replicating Ataraxia's information and sending Shirone back would be the best outcome for now. No, if he hadn't summoned him in the first place, there would have been no need to watch Theraze's reactions.

When Arius learned about Ataraxia, he had infiltrated Alpheas Magic School. But someone with brains existed even in the Red Line, and the black box had already been destroyed.

Ultimately, Shirone was the only person in this world who could wield Ataraxia, and they had no choice but to summon him to the royal castle as a second-best option.

"We're not stealing it - it's a good thing, so let's share it. A son should be able to do that much for his father, right?"

"If Shirone refuses the heir position, I don't intend to force it. But we definitely need that ability."

Arius nodded confidently.

"Don't worry. Let me meet Shirone tomorrow during the paternity test."

Orcamp turned his head with a puzzled expression.

"Paternity test? All the ministers will be observing. Since it's verifying royal bloodline, there can be no trickery."

"Of course not. I have no intention of interfering with the test. First... it's good to be certain about such things, haha. But won't there be opportunities before the test?"

Orcamp finally understood and nodded.

While the test would be conducted under strict control, before the test began, he could quietly approach Shirone.

"I'll trust only you."

"Put your mind at ease. It will work out."

Leaving those words behind, Arius scattered like smoke. It was the trademark ability of those who wielded Scale Magic.

The study door opened and Eliza entered. From her poor complexion, it seemed she had overheard the secret conversation.

"What brings you here at this late hour?"

Eliza clasped her hands together and pleaded.

"Honey, he's our son. I don't know what this is about, but please don't put that child in danger."

"There's no need to worry. It's just... a political matter. Don't concern yourself and go back."

"How can I not worry? Don't you feel any guilt? Don't hurt that child's heart anymore!"

Orcamp's expression turned frighteningly grim.

"Guilt? If we hadn't abandoned the child, Kasula would have become a vassal state of Yakma. I would have been beheaded on the guillotine, and you would have become a plaything for foreign officials. Did you really want that to happen?"

Eliza trembled with a pale face. She knew better than anyone what happened to defeated royal families.

She absolutely didn't want to experience such a thing.

Eliza returned to her room without another word. She would continue to enjoy her current lifestyle. She had no intention of giving up the queen's position that allowed her to obtain whatever she desired.

@

A village 14 kilometers from Kasula's royal castle.

Armin of Eternal Contemplation and Enlightened Eyes was staying in a small village called Toshka while carrying out a special mission.

Of course, his profession as a painter was still valid. Though he had lost his sight, the enlightened eyes that filled his eye sockets allowed him to see the hidden side of the world.

The charcoal passing over the drawing paper drew lines as rough as his emotions.

Today, his hand movements particularly displeased him.

Since artwork inevitably contained the artist's spirit, as the drawing neared completion, only his troubled heart became prominent.

"Huu."

Armin stopped his hand and put down the charcoal.

Due to his professional nature, he accessed and disseminated information from countries around the world. Though the world appeared quietly asleep to ordinary eyes, countless turbulent currents were forming beneath the surface.

'Shirone...'

Recently, among those active in the abyss, Shirone was undoubtedly the most frequently discussed figure.

When Armin first began reading articles about Shirone in Spirit magazine, he was pleased.

He thought the outstanding talent he had sensed at the time was finally beginning to shine.

But the moment he realized what the magic circle introduced in the article was, he was shocked.

He didn't know how Shirone had obtained an archangel's ability, but it was an event worthy of attention from world leaders.

And yesterday, he had gathered intelligence that Shirone had received an invitation from the Kingdom of Kasula.

He was said to be the son Orcamp had lost 18 years ago.

He couldn't verify the truth of the rumor, but if it were true, the Kingdom of Kasula's choice was excellent.

On the other hand, it was dangerous for Shirone.

The Kingdom of Kasula was under the influence of Theraze, the commander of Valkyrie and Empress of the Kashan Empire.

It was too vast a torrent for Shirone, still an incomplete mage, to be swept up in.

"What are you doing? You said you were busy today, but you're not even drawing."

Kayla entered carrying groceries from the market.

Though officially his wife, she was actually his monitor. Seeing Armin lost in thought, she frowned.

"Huh? Oh."

Armin hastily emerged from his thoughts and picked up the charcoal, but he couldn't escape Kayla's sharp eyes.

Even if her perception was slightly dull, she too was someone active in the abyss. She could well guess what Armin was thinking about.

"..."

Kayla waited for Armin to confess honestly without even setting down her shopping basket.

But he just moved his charcoal around as if nothing had happened.

Not being able to tell what he was thinking because his eyes were covered with cloth was the second most irritating thing about dealing with him for Kayla.

"You're not thinking something foolish, are you?"

Armin's hand stopped abruptly. Looking displeased and frowning, he turned to Kayla and asked back.

"Something foolish?"

"Shirone. Of course we should monitor, but it's not our place to interfere. The order from above is to wait until the Kingdom of Kasula reaches its own conclusion."

Armin threw his charcoal carelessly and stood up.

"The Kingdom of Kasula is involved with Black Line mages. You know their abilities better than anyone. Shirone is an important figure to us too. When a conclusion is reached, it will already be too late."

"That's precisely why we can't. The higher-ups strictly control conflicts with the Black Line. This time too, it's better to leave it to the Red Line."

"This isn't something to think about so lightly. The reason they took Shirone is..."

Kayla's eyes turned cold.

"Armin, let me say this again - don't act rashly. This is an order from a superior, not a colleague. If you don't follow my instructions, I'll have no choice but to bring out the Covenant Oath."

Armin glared at Kayla with his mouth firmly shut. If he disobeyed her orders, his loved ones would be hurt. Naturally, Siena was included in that list.

When the enlightened eyes hidden beneath the bandages emitted a cold light, Kayla shivered.

But she couldn't bend her will.

They had been avoiding friction with the Black Line for 40 years. Breaking the balance of power now would only bring greater disaster.

Armin sighed and walked to the window to survey the outside scenery. Though winter had begun, the sun still illuminated the world with strong force.

"...So you're going to come at me like this?"

"I have no choice. That's my job."

Kayla acted out a deliberately cold voice. As one mage, she too didn't want to torment someone who had reached the ultimate in time magic in this way.

But the Covenant Oath was valid from above. It wasn't something she could decide, and therefore she had to persuade Armin by any means necessary. Everything was for his sake.

Armin shot back coldly.

"Is it your job to bind me, constrain me, and restrict me?"

Kayla looked a little wronged.

"Fine! If you're angry, curse at me instead. I'll accept any insult you throw at me. But until orders come down, you can't go anywhere. That's my job."

Armin's breathing became rough.

Feeling like a wild beast was growling, Kayla hurriedly put her right hand in her pocket.

In a one-on-one confrontation, Kayla would be at a slight disadvantage. But she had something to rely on.

The Covenant Oath held in her right hand could be activated at any time.

"Huu, this is really too much."

Armin ended the blood-draining standoff with a long sigh. Then he walked to the table and gently caressed the flowers in the vase.

Flowers forcibly plucked by someone and trapped in a glass bottle. Perhaps his own situation was no different from these flowers.

"Kayla..."

Armin's voice was melancholy. Kayla also approached with a softened expression, as if understanding his feelings.

"Armin, I'm sorry. But..."

"No one can bind me."

At that moment, Armin turned to Kayla and spoke. Then he swept his hand and knocked the vase to the floor.

Kayla's gaze reflexively moved toward the vase.

'Oh no!'

She had lost sight of Armin for just a moment. When she realized this fact, the time field had already been activated.

The vase that had been falling upward stopped in mid-air, and Kayla froze like a doll, unable to return her gaze.

Within the frozen time, Armin's figure was nowhere to be seen.
