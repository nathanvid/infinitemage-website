Dawn broke over the royal castle of Kasula.

Sirone waited in the waiting room prepared by the inspection department for his paternity test.

While visits weren't impossible, since this was a matter the nobles of Kasula were closely watching, no one came to see him.

Once the paternity test was finished, he could never return to his former life. What would his future hold?

"Phew, I'm getting nervous for no reason."

"There's nothing to worry about. It's just a simple test."

Sirone's head snapped up.

A tall, slender man stood there. He didn't have a cold impression, but there was something unsettlingly piercing about him.

A subtle tremor spread through Sirone's nerves. It was the same feeling he'd had when he first met Armin.

"Could it be... an Unlocker?"

Instead of answering, the man politely bowed.

"My introduction is overdue. I am Arius. I serve as an advisor to His Majesty Orcamp."

Sirone narrowed his eyes and raised his guard.

"What brings someone like you here?"

The waiting room was an enclosed space by human standards. Being alone with a master who had infiltrated without anyone knowing was definitely not a safe situation.

"I just wanted to meet you. Unlockers have something that connects us, after all."

Arius seemed to understand Sirone's feelings of resonant trembling and freely revealed his temperament.

"I've heard plenty about your heroic deeds, Sirone. Especially the Photon Cannon—quite impressive. It's probably a battle technique that manipulates mass, isn't it?"

Sirone's tension heightened. If this person were an enemy, having his abilities figured out was not good.

Arius raised both hands to show he meant no harm.

"No need to be so wary. It's pure interest. You could say I'm a fan. As for my own ability, let me introduce it..."

"Scale magic, right?"

"Ho, and what makes you think that?"

"This is a room with all six sides blocked. You couldn't have entered with just spatial movement magic. If you warped time and space simultaneously, it could only be Scale magic."

Arius readily admitted it. Besides, it wasn't particularly secret among the mages working in this field.

"Correct. More than half of all Unlockers are Scale mages. Did you know that too?"

"No, I didn't know that."

This was the first Sirone had heard of it. More than half of Unlockers were Scale mages.

Come to think of it, Armin's magic could also be called a type of Scale magic. Time and space couldn't be thought of as separate, after all.

"The exact reason why there are so many Scale mages among Unlockers hasn't been clarified. We can only guess it has something to do with the nature of Immortal Function. In that regard, your battle technique is quite unique, Sirone. The ability to manipulate mass is extremely rare. I'm truly envious."

"No, it's not that remarkable..."

Arius leaned forward and interrupted.

"Still, I'm stronger."

It was a childish thing to say coming from a high-level mage's mouth. But Arius added without concern:

"I wanted to make this clear."

"Ah, of course."

Sirone didn't bother to deny it. As a skilled practitioner employed by a nation's king, he was a vastly superior senior to a magic school student.

Then Arius tilted his head as if surprised.

"Huh? Aren't you accepting that too easily? Excessive modesty is poison."

"What? No, I'm just a student."

"Of course your magical power is still lacking. But who knows what would happen if you cast Ataraxia?"

Sirone was startled. Ataraxia was the language of heaven. Besides his acquaintances, no one knew about it, and even in academic journals, Killine had used the term "magical amplification array."

'This person has also been to heaven.'

Arius stared intently into Sirone's eyes, as if trying to find a small fairy living inside his pupils. Confirming that the keyword had properly registered, the corners of his mouth slightly rose.

"How do you know about Ataraxia?"

"Haha! Most mages who've been around in this field know about it. It's Archangel Ikael's specialty, after all. Of course, the fact that a human could master it was shocking."

"Then have you been to heaven too?"

Arius nodded casually.

"Once, long ago. But it wasn't particularly interesting to me. Still, I steadily collect information. It's a matter of humanity's survival, after all. We all owe a debt to Miro. Though thanks to that, she also became the greatest mage, so she probably doesn't feel wronged."

Having only thought of Miro's choice as a sacrifice, Sirone found Arius's words refreshingly different.

"Is Miss Miro the greatest Unlocker?"

Arius smiled self-deprecatingly.

"Well, wouldn't she be? Actually, how can anyone know who's the greatest? But she saved humanity itself. And even now she remains in another dimension we can't challenge. No mage born in this era will surpass Miro's legacy. It's unfortunate."

Though it might sound cold, it wasn't unreasonable.

Everyone should have a chance to achieve their dreams. Otherwise, this world that Miro protected with her sacrifice would already be as good as dead.

"I see. But Miss Miro also thought that way..."

"Haha! Of course I know! Don't take it so seriously. If it weren't for Oberek, the founder of Turn Undead magic, humanity would have been conquered by necromancers. Depending on the situation, the number one changes—that's the nature of magic. Besides, this world already had the greatest mage that no one could surpass."

"The greatest mage? Who's that?"

Sirone recalled several names.

Kergoth, who established photonization theory? Ibris, founder of the ignition magic Ignite? Maybe it was Gloria, who systematized the Four-Method System of Spirit Zone.

"The greatest mage in history is... Maclean Guffin."

Sirone slapped his knee in regret.

"Ah! I should have known!"

The mage who installed the gate to heaven in the Kergo Autonomous District. He could tell from Ikael's words just how great a mage he was.

"What kind of person was Guffin?"

Arius scratched his head as if the answer was difficult.

"Hmm, actually, I don't know. There are no records of Guffin left. There's even debate about whether he really existed in this world."

"Huh? But Guffin..."

"Yes. His achievements exist all over the world. But only ruins remain. There are absolutely no historical records of the actual Guffin. Even now, archaeologists wander the world trying to find traces of Guffin, but no form of record has been discovered. Not even folklore."

"How is that possible?"

Sirone was puzzled.

Any human leaves traces of their life. When even nameless nobodies have records passed down through acquaintances, someone like Guffin should be known by the whole world.

"Whether Guffin was a real person is still a matter of academic debate. Some scholars claim he never made contact with any intelligent life during his lifetime. But there's another hypothesis that's currently most favored."

The one called history's greatest mage had vanished without leaving any records. Sirone thought this might itself be tremendous magic.

Arius raised a finger and said:

"Guffin existed in the world. But for some reason, the world forgot him—that's the hypothesis."

Hearing this brought up a memory. It was a story he'd heard from Peope, the fairy of heaven.

Archangel Ikael committed an unforgivable sin. But heaven's citizens don't know what that sin was.

Because Ankh Ra erased the memory.

"Guffin certainly existed in the world but is currently in a state of non-existence. Academia calls this Guffin Erasure, or Reset."

"Reset means..."

"Guffin might have simply erased his own name from the Akashic Records. But then this world should be a corrected whole. Yet why do Guffin's ruins still exist? The Reset theory provides an answer to that. Namely, this world we experience was once initialized at some point."

To Sirone, who hadn't yet reached the depths of intellect, Arius's words sounded like the ravings of a madman. Yet he couldn't turn his thoughts away because of the Unlocker tendency to naturally fall into such problems.

"The representative evidence of Guffin Erasure is something called the 'Fracture Field Verification Experiment.' The total time and energy of the world we live in are subtly misaligned."

Arius spread all ten fingers as if grasping a sphere.

"The Akashic Records are perfect as a whole. Therefore, this world cannot lose its perfection. But fractures can occur. Fractures are individuality, not deficiency. Scholars presume that traces of the reset remain in those fractures."

Sirone couldn't believe it. But if many scholars were seriously discussing it, it wasn't a wild tale.

"If the reset is true, does that mean everyone in this world is living the same life for the second time?"

"That would be the case. Don't think too hard about it. Time doesn't flow—it's perceived. For example, suppose humanity began 10,000 years ago. Did today's people wait 10,000 years to live today? No. They didn't wait even a second. Because time is perceived from the moment of birth. That's why scholars point to déjà vu as evidence of reset. The feeling of experiencing something you've been through before. This too is supposedly a cognitive error caused by the brain confusing time before and after initialization."

Arius raised his index finger and asked:

"So here's the question. How could Maclean Guffin initialize the world?"

A word automatically came to Sirone's mind.

"Immortal Function."

Arius nodded with satisfaction.

"Exactly. If you expand your mind endlessly, the ego dissolves. But every phenomenon has something called a critical point. If you could perfectly control Immortal Function, you'd become a contradictory state that's both infinite and finite. In other words, becoming the whole while retaining your ego."

Arius's explanation reminded Sirone of a similar concept he knew. Becoming the whole while retaining your ego meant, conversely, that ego would dwell in everything. And people called such an existence God.

"I see. So this person called Guffin..."

Sirone finally understood why Maclean Guffin was the greatest mage in this world that no one could surpass.

"Yes. Maclean Guffin is..."

Arius smiled and said:

"The one and only infinite mage in human history."

This was the second time he'd heard the term "infinite mage" since Armin, but the feeling of acceptance was much more intense.

Back then, he'd been ignorant about Immortal Function and Akashic Records. But now he could dimly picture how a human could claim divine status.

"We can't know what era Guffin lived in. 100 years ago? 1,000 years ago? Maybe even before humanity began. However, regarding the timing of the reset, the theory that it was 18 years ago is most credible. Because Guffin's achievements don't appear from that point onward. Coincidentally, 18 years ago was also the year Miro's space-time was born."

Arius spoke of possibilities, but Sirone had directly heard from Ikael that Miro was Guffin's successor.

Also, 18 years ago was... the year he was born too.

But he didn't think deeply about that. He wasn't the only one born 18 years ago, after all.

Arius checked his watch. With little time left before the examination, it was time to be faithful to his original mission.
