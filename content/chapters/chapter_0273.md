He approached Shirone and extended his hand for a handshake.

"I should be going now. I can't leave my post for too long. Since you're also an Unlocker, Shirone, knowing about these matters will help you work as a unique in magical society."

Shirone quickly grasped Arius's hand.

"Yes. This has been really helpful. Thank you."

"Haha! No need to thank me. From now on, I'm planning to steal your Ataraxia."

Arius smiled coldly, but Shirone couldn't see his expression. He had already fallen deep into sleep, his head drooping heavily.

High-level sleep magic cuts the subject's consciousness like a blade, making them unable to even feel the severance of mental waves. Even if Shirone's consciousness revived and clung to the severed memories, he wouldn't sense anything strange.

"Shall we begin?"

Arius was a Scale mage who dealt with mental disciplines and could use a magic called Dive that penetrated human minds.

Among the twelve layers of human consciousness, he could infiltrate anywhere except the twelfth layer shell, which was the domain of intelligence.

However, the interior of the human mind was such a dangerous environment that diving carelessly would cost you ten lives.

Therefore, most divers used the method of casting nets from the surface to pull up only the desired information, with keywords playing the crucial role.

After suddenly implanting keywords in Shirone to make him recall impressions of Ataraxia, Arius warmed up by rotating his waist before casting the dive magic.

Even now, dozens of divers lose their lives each year inside people's minds, but befitting a mage of the Seven Deadly Sins, he cast the magic without hesitation.

"Dive. Ataraxia."

The separation-type Spirit Zone shrunk to its extreme scale and penetrated into Shirone's head. At the same time, Arius's figure disappeared from the waiting room.

He reappeared about five minutes later. He was on his knees, his clothes soaked with sweat as if he had emerged from underwater.

Arius caught his breath and slowly stood up. He stared at Shirone with a troubled expression for quite some time before moving to leave, when a manager's voice came from outside the door.

"Lord Shirone, the trial will begin shortly. Please attend."

Arius clicked his tongue and activated Flicker, the signature technique of Scale mages, disappearing from the waiting room.

"Huh?"

Shirone blinked and looked around.

Though he had been asleep for a full five minutes, his consciousness had been so cleanly severed that it was as if those five minutes had never existed.

With his consciousness in a state of having been cut and reattached, he could only think that Arius had suddenly disappeared while they were shaking hands.

'He really comes and goes like a ghost. Well, Armin was like that too.'

When Shirone didn't respond even after time passed, the manager opened the door and entered.

"Lord Shirone, you must come out now."

"Ah, I'm sorry. I'll come now."

Shirone followed the manager into the courtroom.

The notable nobles of Kasula sat in the jury seats, and two chairs were placed side by side below the judge's bench.

Instead of evidence, various tools were lined up in the evidence storage area, with alchemists and mages inspecting them.

Shirone sat in the right chair and waited briefly. A loud shout came from outside the courtroom, then the door opened.

"His Majesty Orcamp enters!"

The nobles rose to greet him as Orcamp entered with confident steps.

He didn't even glance at the other nobles and examined Shirone's condition. Arius should have already made contact, but there was no way to know if he had succeeded in copying Ataraxia.

"Let us begin."

As Arius, who sat beside Shirone, gave the instruction, the judge proceeded with the examination.

A mage drew blood from both men with a syringe.

The moment the needle pierced the king's body, the atmosphere in the courtroom turned cold.

Once blood collection from Shirone was also complete, an alchemist mixed both types of blood into a substance called Oxstamine. When the beaker was shaken, the liquid changed from deep purple to clear like water.

The alchemist explained.

"The blood mixed with Oxstamine will be stored in a vacuum state for three days. A positive reaction indicates paternity, a negative reaction indicates no paternal relationship."

When the alchemist handed over the blood, the judge placed it into an alchemical box called Caspi.

When the lid closed, air was expelled, creating a vacuum state.

It would break if even a little air seeped in, making it perfect for examinations requiring security.

The judge held up the Caspi and announced.

"This Caspi will go into the vault and be placed in the inner castle garden. The royal castle guards will monitor it 24 hours a day, and any noble with inner castle access privileges may verify it at any time. However, crossing the approach boundary line is strictly forbidden. If separate monitors are assigned, their identities must be registered within one hour."

Shirone nodded at the inspection department's judgment.

By exposing the vault to an unspecified number of people, everyone would monitor everyone else, making it impossible to pull any tricks.

"This concludes the examination regarding the verification of the First Prince of the Kingdom of Kasula."

The procedure ended with the judge striking the gavel.

Orcamp left the courtroom as if he had urgent business, without even saying a word of thanks to Shirone for his trouble.

Shirone, who knew Orcamp's personality, didn't mind anymore. Rather, he was concerned about the fact that there had been no contact from Reina since last night.

He knew she was frantically busy having to approve all administrative tasks as his legal representative. And it was precisely because of this that he could spend his time leisurely like a man of leisure.

But wasn't that why he had brought Amy? Even if the lodging was far away, it was strange that there hadn't been even a word.

"You failed?"

Orcamp's face contorted.

It was the first time he had heard such words since hiring Arius. Moreover, it was something that absolutely should not happen.

The reason he had recruited a criminal from the Black Line, enduring criticism, was solely because he trusted his skills. But failure?

"I apologize. I succeeded in casting the net, but I couldn't replicate it."

Divers pull up concepts sunken in the deep sea of the unconscious to the surface using keywords, a process they call casting nets.

"What's the reason? Didn't you say it would definitely succeed just by implanting keywords?"

"Replication is still possible now. It's just that there's no need to do so."

"No need to do so?"

Arius recalled the situation from that time with a bitter expression.

"The Ataraxia was encapsulated."

"What's encapsulation? A code?"

"No. A code is a rule. You write 100 characters on a one-meter paper strip. You wrap it around a wooden stick of a specific thickness and read the characters reflected on one side. If a sentence appears, it's a code. Then what about encapsulation? You write a clear sentence on a one-meter paper strip. Then you crumple it up randomly. There's no pattern and no way to solve it. What I actually saw wasn't Ataraxia but an information cloud where all kinds of information were tangled like thread."

Arius raised his index finger and continued.

"So why is there no need to replicate it? Keywords make the target recall specific concepts. For example, like this: apples are delicious. Then an apple comes to mind in Your Majesty's head. But that's the apple Your Majesty thinks of, not the perfect apple. The perfect apple is dissolved in the unconscious in a pre-linguistic form. Ultimately, thoughts revealed through keywords are just shadows. Usually that's enough, but when it's encapsulated like this time, it's useless. Even if you replicate the information cloud, it's just an information cloud."

Orcamp couldn't blame Arius. Because he understood. And if he blamed him, it would only reveal his own ignorance.

"Then what do you plan to do now? We absolutely need Ataraxia."

"First, try talking to Shirone. To find a solution, I think I need to see Ataraxia directly. What kind of information system it is, what its activation principle is. Only after such information is gathered can I tell you. Of course, I've installed a door so I can go back in anytime."

"A demonstration of Ataraxia..."

Orcamp didn't like Arius's proposal.

Since Shirone was a clever child, there was a high probability he suspected he hadn't been invited to the royal castle simply for a paternity test.

In such a situation, if they brought up their true purpose, the shock Shirone would receive would be tremendous.

For the sake of protecting the kingdom, he could bear the stigma of being a despicable father. But he wanted to avoid a situation where Shirone would refuse to cooperate because of it.

"Isn't that too obvious? He'll definitely be suspicious."

"Your Majesty, this is a major matter involving a change of First Prince. The Theraze faction will also try to settle things within the three days before the test results come out. If we don't use the advantage of having negotiation rights with Shirone first, the initiative will pass to Theraze's side."

Orcamp fell into careful thought.

Whether to embrace Shirone to the end or use him and cast him aside. Either choice was better made sooner rather than later.

"If we're going to do it anyway, something grand would be good, right?"

Arius replied with a cunning smile instead of words.

Shirone, who had been heading to his parents' lodging, stopped in the second-floor corridor. An unnamed manager who was Zion's messenger was blocking his path. In this vast royal castle, it was amazing how they could find him like ghosts.

"Lord Shirone, you must come with me."

Shirone straightened his back and pulled in his chin.

It certainly wasn't for something pleasant, but avoidance wasn't a good choice.

Rather than running away and getting hit from behind, it was more effective to meet directly and observe the reaction.

"Lead the way."

"Indeed, an excellent choice. Please follow me."

The manager took Shirone to the basement. It was a place where storage warehouses were concentrated, so foot traffic was extremely limited, and the sections were complex like a maze due to frequent expansion construction.

They arrived at the outermost area, where a door was installed that allowed further entry into the wall.

It wasn't a room that had existed originally.

"This is the place. Please enter."

Shirone didn't relax his tension as he grasped the door handle.

Contrary to his expectation of a room, there was a square tunnel with torches burning, and he could see another door installed 15 meters ahead.

A double entrance.

They probably didn't choose this structure as a joke, but no reasonable explanation came to mind either.

When they were about halfway through the tunnel, the manager slammed the door shut with a thud. It was clearly to signal someone of their presence.

Shirone, who had stopped in surprise, took another deep breath and opened the second door.

It was an entirely white room.

It wasn't painted but made entirely of marble, and various objects were displayed on shelves running along the walls.

No particularly luxurious items were visible, but knowing Zion's tendencies, it felt rather unsettling.

Zion and Woorin were drinking tea at a table. Seeing Woorin put him a little at ease, but he realized even such thoughts were dangerous and erased them from his mind.

"You're here. What are you standing around for? Come in quickly."

Shirone couldn't readily move his feet. Zion and Woorin were looking at him with eyes full of mischief.

But he couldn't keep standing at the door forever, so he stepped forward while being as vigilant as possible of his surroundings.

At that moment, the floor suddenly sank with a thud, and his body tumbled forward.

"Ugh! What!"

Shirone quickly raised his head. The floor was soft so he didn't receive any impact, but when he heard Zion and Woorin giggling, he became so embarrassed that even his ears turned red.

'What kind of floor is so soft?'

As he crawled around feeling his surroundings, he felt solid floor at some boundary.

"Are you okay, brother? Sorry for playing a trick on you. But it was fun, wasn't it?"

Woorin approached and extended her hand.

Shirone grasped her hand and stood up, then looked back at where he had fallen. There were no distinguishing features from the other floors.

"What is this?"

"It's 'Soft and Fluffy Everywhere.'"

"Soft and fluffy... what?"
