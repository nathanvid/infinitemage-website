Woorin scraped the floor where Shirone had fallen with her finger. A transparent vinyl peeled away with a stretching sound and came off in her hand.

"Ta-da! This is it. Take another look at the floor now."

When Shirone pressed down with his foot, unlike when he had fallen earlier, he felt the hardness of marble that matched common sense. Even when he put his full weight on it and tapped, the result was the same.

"Amazing, right? With just this, you can take a nap even in rocky terrain. It can even do things like this. Watch carefully."

Woorin walked over to an eagle sculpture taller than herself and covered it with the vinyl. Like magic, the sculpture sank down and a flat floor was revealed.

She pressed down her skirt and jumped up, landing on her bottom. Her buttocks sank into the soft floor and bounced back up.

Though her actions were childish, Shirone watched seriously. He couldn't guess what was causing this phenomenon.

It wasn't science. But it wasn't magic either.

Shirone looked around seriously. Finally, he realized why the objects in the room weren't luxurious. This was a place where the world's most expensive items were gathered.

Woorin grinned and said, "That's right. This is a place for collecting Objects."

He had expected it, but hearing the words spoken aloud brought a realistic shock.

He recalled the Sleep Object that the 2nd-rank demon Baal had possessed in Heaven.

Even then, he had shuddered at its grotesqueness, but the current shock was on a completely different level.

'You're saying everything here is an Object?'

Tableware belongs in the kitchen, books in the libraryâ€”objects are usually arranged according to their function. But the objects here had no order to their placement, and no consistency could be found in the order they were displayed.

Roughly counting, there were over 50 objects on display. Only the Theraze family, which dominated the continent, could make this possible.

While Shirone was lost in thought, Zion approached. He held a Spirit academic journal in his hand.

His reaction was predictably cynical. With a sneer that showed his contempt, he thrust the magazine forward and said, "So you're a genius magic student hopeful?"

Shirone didn't even want to respond.

"Of course magic is a great power. I acknowledge that. But you know, even such abilities are nothing compared to Objects, right? A 3rd-rank Grand Mage working at Kasula Royal Castle makes about 30 million gold annually. If we sold one object here, how many Grand Mages could we hire?"

"What are you trying to say?"

"That no matter how outstanding a mage is, they're ultimately just a dog of the royalty. A ruler's talent isn't determined by something like magic."

Zion held the Spirit magazine at Shirone's eye level and dropped it. Then, as if he knew nothing, he stepped on the magazine while passing by Shirone and turning around.

"How nice for you, becoming First Prince in three days. How does it feel? Are you already feeling like a king?"

Since the paternity test was finished, the nobles' psychological warfare would intensify further. In such a situation, it was natural for Zion, who was at the center of power, to check Shirone's mental state.

"I thought I made it clear. I'm not interested. Once the results come out, I'm going home."

"Hah, sure you will."

Zion didn't believe it.

Who in the world would refuse the throne? Even if such a person existed, it would be because they hadn't yet tasted the sweetness of power.

Power guarantees every kind of pleasure that humans crave.

Once he became First Prince, no matter how cultivated Shirone's character was, his thinking would have to change.

"There's no point in acting noble. This is the royal castle, after all. Especially that kind of act won't work on me."

Zion snatched the "Soft and Fluffy Everywhere" from Woorin and threw it on the floor.

"With just one toy-like object like this, I could buy your entire magic school. In an instant, I'd become your teacher. Your instructor would have to crawl between my legs. And what? You're not interested in the throne? Do you think I'd believe that?"

Shirone realized that Zion was an extremely materialistic person. The reason for attending school was to gain intangible values contained within, not the visible things.

Hearing the story, "Soft and Fluffy Everywhere" apparently cost in the hundreds of millions, yet he dismissed it as merely a children's toy.

The reality-defying abilities of Objects could be worth anything depending on how they were used.

For example, what if it concealed a vault storing an 'Elemental Essence'?

No matter how expensive Objects were, they were nothing compared to the Elemental Essences, of which only 17 existed in the world (Fire 2, Water 3, Wind 5, Earth 7).

Once equipped, they not only allowed casting magic of the corresponding element but could also block 100% of magic of the same element, making their value known to exceed a small kingdom's budget.

Ultimately, there would always be those in the world who absolutely needed them, and they wouldn't hesitate to spend to get what they wanted.

The Theraze family might buy them for fun, but thinking Objects were expensive simply due to a collector's desire was just Zion's misconception.

"I think it would be better to transfer 'Soft and Fluffy Everywhere' to someone else. No matter how good a book is, it's useless to someone who uses it as a pot stand."

"Haha! That's exactly the privilege of royalty. A good book? We'd even use gold as a pot stand."

Shirone gritted his teeth and swallowed his anger. Since they were different from birth, they couldn't find common ground even in trivial matters.

"Fine. If you're done talking, I'm going back."

Since staying longer would only hurt his feelings, he headed for the door, but Woorin ran over and grabbed his sleeve.

"Wait! I also have business with Shirone oppa. There's something I want to show you. Come this way."

Shirone couldn't firmly refuse if it was Woorin.

First, she was someone he could communicate with, and she had supported him among the arrogant royalty. Most importantly, she was the daughter of the powerful Theraze family.

"Quickly, quickly. This way."

When Shirone was dragged away by Woorin, Zion sneered, but his situation wasn't much different.

When Woorin said she had business, he couldn't say anything and just followed his sister.

Woorin sat Shirone at a table and brought over a small box.

It was a shabby rectangular wooden frame with a hemispherical depression inside. In the center was a finger-stained arrow-shaped pointer, which seemed to be a roulette that you flicked with your finger to spin.

"This is an Object called 'Daily Gift.' It leaves a gift once a day."

Though it was simple enough for a child to understand, Shirone felt like something crucial was missing, as if there were no subject or object.

"Hehe, strange, right? Everyone's like that at first. Objects exist in a category beyond common sense, so when you encounter their 'instructions,' there are often cases that don't make sense."

"That's true. The strangest thing is the phrase 'leaves behind.' Who exactly? This is just an object."

"The 'instructions' contain two meanings. First, for 'leaving' to be established, gravity is needed. Also, it 'goes' but doesn't 'come.' Therefore, there must be a space that cannot be observed from inside or outside."

Shirone realized why the entrance to this place had a double structure.

A third location was needed where people wouldn't pass by from inside or outside.

"'Gravity' and 'no observers.' When these two conditions are met, it gives a gift once a day. If you look closely at this roulette, you'll see it's divided into four colors."

Shirone turned his gaze to where Woorin pointed.

It seemed quite old, with paint peeling off, but the brightness levels were different. The areas were of varying sizes, with writing carved inside. Though faint and hard to see, it definitely wasn't Tormian language.

Woorin explained while pointing to each of the four areas.

"The letters written here are in the language used by gypsies in the eastern mountain regions. Translated, they mean modest gift, pleasant gift, excessive gift, and miracle. Measuring the radian values, modest gift occupies about 75%, pleasant gift 20%, excessive gift 4%, and miracle 1%."

"Hmm..."

The fact that modest gift was 75% meant the gift disparity was quite high. The 4% probability excessive gift was also exciting, but he was even more curious about what the miracle was.

Since it could only be spun once a day, by simple calculation, a miracle should hit within 100 days. But considering probability concepts, it could take much longer.

Shirone carefully pointed at the roulette's pointer, worried his fingertip might touch it.

"Do I spin this arrow?"

"Yes. That's why I was waiting for oppa to come."

"Huh? For me?"

"Try spinning it once. I'll give you whatever gift comes out."

At the unexpected words, Shirone blinked.

With Woorin's wealth, no matter how good the gift, she wouldn't be greedy for it, but not knowing what might come up, she wasn't the type to readily yield to others either.

"Probability..."

In any case, it was an opportunity to experience an Object firsthand.

Shirone wasn't particularly greedy for gifts either. He was just extremely curious about what kind of gift would come out.

Perhaps that was the true value of this Object.

The excitement felt while imagining gifts.

In that sense, "Daily Gift" was a recreational tool that understood human psychology very well. Unlike other gambling, there was no failure.

"At least a modest gift is guaranteed. Then, may I try once?"

"Of course. I do it every day anyway."

Woorin readily agreed while adding an explanation.

"You flick the end of the pointer with your finger. From experiments, we found that if it doesn't spin at least ten times, it's judged invalid. But that doesn't forfeit the day's opportunity, so you don't need to be nervous."

"Oh, I see."

Shirone's eyes lit up with interest.

Why must it spin at least ten times? If there was no rotation limit, one could hit a miracle just by gently pushing the pointer.

'Really amazing. Even though it's an object, it has rules like a regulation exception.'

At that moment, a good idea came to mind.

"This... I might be able to make it always land on miracle."

Then Woorin's eyes lit up like Shirone's.

The insight to analyze one object from multiple angles is an essential condition for Object collectors. In that sense, Shirone had considerable collector instincts.

"As expected of a mage, you're different. You mean controlling your senses to spin exactly 3,600 degrees?"

"Right. Or hiring a professional gambler. If you feel the roulette's sensitivity and control the force, you can always produce the same value."

"Good thinking. But unfortunately, it's impossible. I've already tried. Probably when the roulette spins, the position is determined through some specific random number conversion."

"Hmm, that means 'Daily Gift' is manipulating probability, right? Even the 1% for miracle might be deception. Then it wouldn't be fair gambling."

If it was a gambling Object, at least the probability should be fair. Otherwise, there would be no need to have an interface for testing probability in the first place.

Woorin felt a strong sense of kinship with Shirone.

Actually, she had let several people besides Shirone spin the roulette. But most were more absorbed in the gift they would receive rather than being fascinated by the Object's nature.

When she saw them praying for expensive gifts in front of the roulette, she sometimes got annoyed and left.

They say Object collectors need two things: an interesting Object and an audience who recognizes the Object's true value.

Zion occasionally procured decent Objects, but his discernment was utterly lacking.
