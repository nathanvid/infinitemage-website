But Shirone was different.

In her opinion, Daily Gift held significance not in the material value of the gifts, but in being able to feel the anticipation of receiving a present every day.

In that sense, Shirone's tendency to explore Objets resonated with her own feelings when she first obtained Daily Gift.

"That's right. That's why I once invited a master of Schema. I can't reveal his name, but he was a world-class professional gambler. He spun it ten times over ten days with the same force, but the results were different every time. However, I still believe this is valid as gambling."

"Why? Did you discover some other characteristic?"

Zion couldn't bear the boredom and yawned.

Of course, he knew that understanding the Objet's instructions was important.

But such headache-inducing work could be left to subordinates. Royalty just needed to purchase and enjoy Objets.

Regardless, Woorin's gaze was focused entirely on Shirone.

"It's because of the statistics. I obtained this roulette exactly 1,003 days ago. So excluding today, I've spun it 1,002 times. Among those, miracles came up twice. Modest gifts 823 times, pleasant gifts 171 times, and excessive gifts 6 times."

Shirone caught on to what Woorin was trying to say.

"Ah, the probability and statistics roughly match. Then we'd have to consider the variable fair. Perhaps that variable is something humans can't control...?"

Woorin pointed at Shirone and shouted.

"Exactly! The fact that statistics follow probability means there's no trickery. Therefore, this Objet still has value as a gambling tool."

Shirone rested his chin on his hand and fell into thought.

From a statistical perspective, fair rules existed. But even the world's best gambler couldn't produce the same result. That meant it was ultimately a variable that activated in a realm humans couldn't control.

"An extremely sensitive sensor, one that can't be controlled by muscle strength?"

"Yes. The experts' opinion is the same. They say it's probably quantum-level variance."

Quantum level.

Indeed, it would be impossible to control the weight of an electron, lighter than an atom, with muscular force. In the end, it meant that despite looking childish, it was an extremely precise device.

Shirone examined Daily Gift more carefully than before.

On the surface, it just looked like an old antique. A crude wooden case. A miniature clown was smiling, and childish drawings were painted on the hemispherical surface.

Suddenly, he remembered the sight of gypsy village children happily spinning roulettes. Normally it would be a heartwarming scene, but now it somehow gave him a creepy feeling.

"What kind of gift does it give when a miracle comes up?"

Woorin's face hardened coldly.

"I can't tell you that."

Shirone stared at her blankly. Then, as if nothing had happened, she stuck out her tongue and returned to a cute expression.

"Hehe, just kidding. It wouldn't be fun if I told you in advance. Oh my, now hurry up and spin it."

"Hmm, shall I?"

Shirone also stopped analyzing and prepared to enter the real test.

He flicked his finger, but control with human strength was impossible anyway.

Everything had to be left entirely to luck. Toward a childish future where only enjoyment awaited.

"Then I'll start."

Shirone placed his finger on the end of the pointer and flicked it.

Tiri-ri-ri. Making a sound like you'd hear from a toy, the arrow spun around.

Woorin watched with sparkling eyes. Even Zion seemed interested this time, crossing his arms and fixing his gaze on the roulette.

When the pointer stopped, Woorin slammed the table and jumped up.

"Wow! It's an excessive gift! This is a 4 percent probability!"

Shirone was so gripped by tension that he couldn't even feel joy at winning such low odds.

The roulette had spun exactly according to its instructions. Now what would happen?

Knock knock!

Shirone turned toward the door at the knocking sound. But no matter how long he waited, he couldn't sense any further presence.

"It's here! Brother, quickly go out and see!"

Shirone walked quickly to the door. On the other hand, it took quite a bit of mental preparation before opening it.

When he pulled the door handle, he saw a scene of torches burning in a rectangular cave.

There was no sign of life, not even a fly buzzing around.

Shirone recalled gravity and looked at the floor. A gift box decorated with a red ribbon was placed there.

Seeing the gift that had appeared out of nowhere, chills ran down his spine.

This was an enclosed space. He hadn't heard the sound of the first door opening either. Then who on earth had knocked?

"Brother, quickly show us. I'm curious."

As Woorin urged him, Shirone picked up the gift with an uneasy feeling and placed it on the table.

Zion and Woorin craned their necks like turtles to look.

"It's yours, brother, so you open it."

When he pulled the red ribbon, the square package came undone smoothly by itself.

It was a romantic scene, but Shirone handled the gift as carefully as if dealing with explosives.

"Huh? What's this?"

Inside the gift box was a porcelain doll.

It was a three-head-tall girl with black hair that fell to her ankles. She had long eyelashes, and her eyes, crafted from jewels, looked like real human eyes.

It wasn't particularly grotesque in form, but Shirone felt such revulsion that he didn't even want to touch it.

They say the point where humans feel the most fear is the midpoint between the unfamiliar and the familiar.

The porcelain doll was the same.

The proportions were a mess and it had no life, but the hair, eyelashes, and eyes were exactly like a human's, evoking fear in those who looked at it.

On the other hand, Woorin's eyes widened as she showed interest.

"Oh, this?"

Woorin's hand unconsciously reached for the doll, but she hesitated and glanced at Shirone. After offering to give a gift, showing interest might make him feel burdened.

Shirone readily yielded. Honestly, he hated even looking at it.

"It's fine. I don't know what it is, so you take a look."

Woorin carefully took out the doll, worried she might crack the surface.

Zion followed it with his gaze.

Though he wasn't knowledgeable about dolls, he couldn't fail to recognize that. It was one of his sister's main collections, something he had searched high and low to obtain for her.

"It's El Crouch's seamless joint doll."

"Huh? El Crouch?"

Woorin held the doll up to the ceiling light and examined the inside of the porcelain face. As expected, it was authentic with no traces of joints.

With confidence, she spoke belatedly.

"El Crouch is a doll maker. He's famous for not using adhesives. Only twelve of Crouch's works have been made public, and they all have owners. I own four of them too. In other words, this is an unpublished work. If put up for auction, it would start at a minimum of 100 million gold."

"What? 100 million gold?"

Shirone's eyes widened.

The annual living expenses of a commoner family in the Kingdom of Tormia were roughly 100 gold. Moreover, Shirone's poor family had once lived on 50 gold for a year before entering the Ozent family as servants.

Even by a mage's income standards, it was an enormous amount.

The annual salary of a mage just entering the profession was about 4,000 gold, and even a certified 6th-grade mage's average annual salary didn't exceed 200,000 gold. In other words, it was money that Teacher Shiina would have to work herself to the bone for 500 years to accumulate.

From 5th grade and above, classified as veterans, annual salaries varied greatly depending on ability, but considering that a 3rd-grade Great Magician at Kasula's royal castle earned about 30 million, 100 million was an amount that would change any noble's expression.

'Wait, come to think of it...'

The amount wasn't the problem. How could El Crouch's work be selected as a gift?

If it was an artist's work, it was something that clearly existed in the world. Unless the gift was prepared in advance, it meant that objects from a specific space had been moved instantaneously.

"...How is this possible?"

"Because it's an Objet. Excessive gifts judge the value of rarity. Once, a deep-sea fish that looked like a human face arrived. It died immediately though. There's no guarantee that excessive gifts are necessarily expensive items. In that sense, if it's El Crouch's doll, it's a tremendous material gain. You can even sell this."

Woorin glanced at Shirone.

"Um, so what I'm saying is..."

Shirone could guess without even hearing.

She had already collected four dolls. Though it might look hideous to others, for an enthusiast, nothing could be more lovely.

"If you want it, take it. I can give this much as a gift."

"What? Oh, no! There's no need to go that far! I was just going to buy this for 100 million. But I thought you might dislike such transactions..."

She seemed to remember how he had gotten angry when Eliza offered to buy his parents a castle on the first day he was invited to the royal castle.

"Haha! Right. I don't need the money. Just take it. After all, the Objet is yours too."

100 million gold was an amount that even Shirone would be reluctant to throw away.

But if the recipient was Woorin, the supreme power holder of Kasula, it was worth giving up. No matter how much he liked money, it wouldn't be more expensive than his life.

As expected, Zion's face contorted.

Why incur a debt to the rival competing with his real brother for the throne? No matter how thoughtless she might be, this time her thinking was too short-sighted.

'No, would she really do that?'

An ominous thought suddenly crossed Zion's mind.

Woorin was a sister who listened well to her brother. Despite being Theraze's direct heir, she had never once disrespected him.

But today was a bit strange.

It was Woorin who had chosen the place to meet Shirone.

Of course, she liked to show off Objets, so choosing the gallery was understandable. But among all the many Objets, why Daily Gift specifically?

'Because it's the most probabilistic Objet...'

If Shirone had landed on the 75 percent modest gift, there would have been no problem at all.

But the result was an excessive gift with only 4 percent probability.

Moreover, the gift was El Crouch's porcelain doll that Woorin treasured so much.

'Woorin isn't a fool who incurs debts to just anyone. Perhaps she was testing Shirone's luck? If so, that means she's weighing between me and Shirone...'

Just imagining it made his throat burn.

It was a delusion. A simple coincidence. He had to think that way.

When Shirone could win even a 4 percent probability, what reason was there to think Woorin's choice of Daily Gift wasn't coincidental?

Moreover, she was Theraze's daughter. Even if she pretended not to know, she wouldn't lack the ambition of a conqueror. Even if she liked Shirone, she wasn't empty-headed enough to betray her real brother who held Kasula's political power.

"Ah, it's really pretty. Thank you, Brother Shirone."

Watching Woorin hug the porcelain doll and rejoice, Shirone understood why brothers take care of their sisters.

But his pleased smile soon turned to worry. No matter how he thought about it, the Objet wasn't a normal item.

"Woorin, it would be better not to spin this roulette anymore."

"Huh? Why?"

Shirone looked at Daily Gift with distaste.

"It doesn't make sense. No magic can violate the principle of equivalent exchange. Even unorthodox techniques are a type of mental equivalent exchange. But Objets are too bizarre. If you keep getting gifts like this, someday you might have to pay a price."

Woorin blinked for a moment, then carefully placed the porcelain doll in the box with deliberate movements. Then she sat down, rested her chin on her hand, and flicked the ineffective pointer of Daily Gift.

"Hmm, I understand what you mean. But if you think that way, nothing in the world is 100 percent safe. For example, the frequency of deaths from Objets is lower than deaths from kitchen knives."

"But there are fewer Objet users than kitchen knife users. One out of ten dying is different from ten out of a hundred dying. You can't judge just by numbers. Besides, from what I hear, there are definitely people who die from Objets?"

Woorin held out Daily Gift to Shirone.

"This Objet first appeared in the world 240 years ago. And among the people who owned this item, some actually met miserable deaths."
