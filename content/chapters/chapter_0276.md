"Equivalent exchange of fortune and misfortune?"

"No. It's not a problem with the Objet, but with humans. The first owner of *Daily Gift* was a cobbler living in the lower class. He probably made a lot of money. But he couldn't overcome the obsession. On days when he got modest gifts, he became extremely depressed. That happened 75 out of 100 days. Eventually, he developed a mental illness and went insane, spinning the roulette all day long."

It was a phenomenon that occurred when humans became addicted to probability.

In reality, people who became addicted to gambling and fell to rock bottom don't gamble to make money. What they want is the thrill of winning in a battle of odds, and money is merely a tool to achieve that.

"As time passed, *Daily Gift* ended up in the hands of a nobleman. He wasn't the type to stare at the roulette just because he lacked money. But one day, he hit the miracle. And..."

"And?"

Woorin pouted her lips, imagining the situation at that time.

"The family was ruined."

"Ruined? Why?"

"When you hit the miracle, it gives you an Objet. The Objet the nobleman received was a small stone called *Nemesis*, and when you make contact with it, the user's imagination manifests as reality within a 20-meter radius. The nobleman who obtained *Nemesis* became immersed in imagination every day. You know, brother. That thing called human desire..."

Feeling embarrassed to say it out loud, Woorin wiggled her index finger and clicked her tongue.

Sirone understood immediately. He also didn't think it was necessarily bad.

All humans live with desires and achieve balance with reality through imagination.

The problem was when that imagination became reality.

"Anyway, that's how they were ruined. And *Nemesis* left to find a new owner. Even now, it's very popular among enthusiasts. But it seems they can't last long. There was a case where it returned to the auction house in just a month. Of course, it's true that Objets are dangerous. But that's a human problem, not an Objet problem. In fact, most owners of *Daily Gift* lived comfortable lives."

In that case, Sirone had nothing to say. But his feelings became even stranger.

If it wasn't particularly dangerous, then what exactly were Objets? Why were such things circulating in the world?

Sirone turned his gaze to *Daily Gift*.

From a collector's perspective, an Objet that produces other Objets was like a goose that lays golden eggs.

But on the other hand, he thought it was terribly destructive. If there was no limit to Objet production, the world would eventually be destroyed, if not immediately, then someday.

When he voiced these thoughts, Woorin agreed to some extent.

"That's possible. Though not in our generation. But it'll be fine. Even Objets aren't more durable than other objects. They're bound to break down over time. Among the items that have appeared from hitting the miracle so far, the most dangerous is *Nemesis*. Curia Auction classifies *Nemesis* as A-grade. *Daily Gift* is also A-grade. It seems it can't give gifts above its own grade."

Curia was a global auction company, which Sirone had heard about from Ned before.

But Sirone was more interested in something else.

*Daily Gift* couldn't produce gifts above its own grade. It sounded plausible at first glance, but it didn't make sense.

"How is that possible? Grades are determined by auction companies, so there's no way the Objet would know the criteria. Isn't it just a coincidence? Even after 240 years, the frequency of hitting miracles is low. When you factor in the probability of A-grade items appearing, there isn't enough data to make statistics."

"That might be true, but..."

Woorin neither confirmed nor denied, speaking vaguely. Sirone's thinking was certainly logical, but when you own over 40 Objets personally, you inevitably gain access to new information that ordinary people can't reach.

One of those was the VIP membership card issued by Curia Auction Company. On the back of the card were precautions, and the first item contained this phrase:

*Document* Objets do not guarantee 100% safety to users.

Members see the first item and demand explanations from curators. The curators then share several cases that allow speculation about the principles behind Objet generation, and after hearing those stories, you realize that the warning in the first item isn't just a threatening clause.

But Woorin kept quiet about this particular matter.

You can't become a VIP member of Curia just by having a lot of money. You need to have an alliance-like consciousness toward Objets.

Abusing privileges to non-VIP members would be an act of diminishing the value of Objets themselves.

But stopping the game wouldn't be tolerated by Theraze's pride, so Woorin gave Sirone a chance to realize it himself.

"Come this way. I'll show you other Objets."

Woorin guided Sirone to the shelves. The first thing she introduced was a magnifying glass you could get anywhere.

"This is an Objet called *Just Once!* It shows people's bare skin."

"You mean it can see through clothes?"

"Yes. But the effect only works within 5 centimeters."

Woorin said "Oh my" and pointed it toward Sirone's lower body.

Even though he had already heard the instructions, Sirone unconsciously crossed his legs. Then Woorin stuck out her tongue and handed him the magnifying glass.

"Hehe, try it yourself, brother."

Sirone used the magnifying glass to look at his arm.

At first, only the fabric appeared magnified, but when he brought it closer, bare skin was revealed.

"Interesting. But if it works like this, it would be better to just look openly."

"Exactly! If you were peeping at women, you'd get caught immediately. That's probably why it's called *Just Once!*"

"Haha! That could be it. But depending on how you use it, this could be useful. It seems like it could see through armor too, so you could use it for inspections."

Sirone returned *Just Once!*

"What's the principle? See-through vision."

"I haven't confirmed it yet. Objet abilities don't necessarily follow the function of the object, so it could be the ability of the handle or frame. Actually, it's not a high-grade Objet. I bought it by chance and just keep it to round out the numbers."

Even to Sirone, it seemed inferior compared to *Daily Gift*.

The next Objet Woorin introduced was a bookshelf. It was packed full of works by renowned scholars.

"This belongs to Zion. It's an Objet called *The Philosopher*. If you place books on this shelf, their contents enter your mind without reading them. It can hold about 124 books in Kasula format. However, be aware that when you remove books from the shelf, the memories disappear too."

Sirone was astonished. The idea that simply placing books on a shelf would put their contents into your head was a different kind of shock from *Daily Gift*.

"How can a bookshelf connect to a person's mind?"

"Well, that's surprisingly simple. Some Objets have a tendency to be bound to their users. In auctions, this is called *Contract Type*. In other words, *The Philosopher* is a *Contract Type* Objet that's bound to Zion. This is B-grade according to Curia Auction standards."

Sirone examined *The Philosopher* with fascination.

If nothing else, he really wanted to have this *The Philosopher*. He could somewhat understand why collectors became obsessed with Objets.

Woorin introduced several other Objets. A headband called *Beauty* would make you exercise for an hour while unconscious when worn.

You could lose weight without difficulty, but since you often made ugly movements, the instructions were to preferably lock the door.

There was also an Objet called *Soulless Massage*. It was a pair of stones in red and blue colors, and when held in both hands, painful areas would contract to relax muscles.

When Sirone tried it himself, it was quite refreshing. As massage was applied simultaneously to his arms, legs, shoulders, ankles, and soles of his feet, he felt so good he nearly lost consciousness. Even though he couldn't feel human warmth, the effect was the best.

'So that's why it's called *Soulless Massage*? This is probably about D-grade.'

Having thought that far, Sirone's eyes widened.

The names of the Objets he had encountered so far. Plus the grades that even an outsider like himself could judge. These two facts were revealing the secret of Objets.

'I see. Objets are...'

*Daily Gift* doesn't give Objets above A-grade. But for that instruction to hold true, one of two hypotheses must be followed.

Either Objets know the auction company's standards, or Objets themselves have predetermined values.

The answer was the latter.

Objets possess inherent value from birth. This is because their functions are all directly connected to human desires.

To see them as naturally occurring objects, their purpose was too clear, meaning they were artificial products of intelligent beings.

The desire to be beautiful, the desire to gain knowledge, the desire to receive gifts daily, the desire to make imagination reality.

In that sense, *Nemesis*, which fulfills the highest desires, certainly deserved an A-grade rating.

'Then what's S-grade?'

Thinking in reverse about *Daily Gift* not giving anything above A-grade meant that S-grade existed.

Sirone thought there was a high probability of that. Humans have not only animal desires but also higher-dimensional aspirations.

If *Nemesis*, the pinnacle of animal desires, was A-grade, then S-grade was likely to be an Objet containing rational aspirations.

'Hehe. It seems I'm getting a bit of a feel for this.'

As Sirone remained lost in thought for a long time, Woorin smiled contentedly. This was why she collected Objets.

Meanwhile, Zion was burning up inside.

This was the first time Woorin had kept someone other than a Curia Auction VIP member in the gallery for so long.

'That bastard dares...'

To Zion, Woorin was more than a sister. She was the most powerful weapon he possessed. More than the royal blood flowing through his veins.

'Why? What's so special about that bastard that she's fussing over him?'

Unaware of Zion's boiling emotions, Sirone quickly examined the other items.

Looking at it now, it was truly enormous wealth. Most of the Objets lined up along the shelves were C-grade or B-grade, but occasionally A-grade ones caught his eye.

It was a luxury that even a king of a nation couldn't afford. You could imagine how powerful Woorin, the direct lineage of Theraze, was.

After examining all the eastern shelves, Sirone turned his gaze north. But that area was desolately empty, with only a single sword on display.

"Hm? Woorin, what's that sword?"

"That's *Magic Sword Armand*. It's the Objet Zion treasures most."

Something that Zion, who considered even gold worthless, treasured most. For such a thing, it wasn't particularly ornate.

It wasn't covered with colorful treasures, and it didn't even have a sheath. However, there was strangely something captivating about it. There seemed to be subtle design differences that ordinary people couldn't distinguish.

But even that assessment disappeared the moment he saw the gem embedded in the center of the handle. An overwhelming presence was conveyed that made it impossible to look away.

As if Armand itself was calling, his feet moved on their own. When he came to his senses, he had somehow arrived at the northern wall.

The moment he slowly reached out his hand to grasp the sword's handle, Zion shouted.

"That's mine! Don't touch it."

Even after Sirone stepped back in surprise, Zion's distorted expression showed no signs of relaxing.

*Magic Sword Armand* was a *Contract Type* Objet bound to its user. But its presence was so strong that it sometimes reached out to other users.

The exact instructions for the criteria by which it chooses users haven't been revealed yet, but the very fact that it seduced another person in the presence of its owner was unpleasant.

Sirone came to his senses and asked Zion.

"Ah, sorry. I did that without realizing. But this is S-grade, right?"

"What would you do knowing that? You can't even afford junk grade. Get away from my sword quickly. Where does a bastard like you get off coveting royalty's treasures?"

Sirone frowned and turned away. No matter how much *Magic Sword Armand* was an S-grade Objet, he didn't lack enough self-respect to maintain interest after hearing such words.

Watching this, Zion reconsidered. Wasn't this actually a good thing? This was a good opportunity to show the gap between royalty and a mountain hunter.
