"Fine. If you're that curious, I'll introduce you specially."

"No, I'm not really..."

Before Shirone could finish speaking, Zion extended his hand toward where the sword was.

"Come, Armand."

The clear ring of metal resonated throughout the room.

The moment Shirone turned toward Armand, the sword that had risen on its own was drawn into Zion's hand.

Shirone, who had turned around again following the sword's trajectory, stopped his movement abruptly. Before he knew it, a blade had reached his throat. The cold metal vibrated, sending high-frequency waves around his ears.

Woorin, whose hobby time had been interrupted, complained irritably.

"Brother! Why are you suddenly acting like this?"

"You stay quiet."

This time, even Zion couldn't back down.

As he glared at Shirone, his lips twisted naturally. The look in Shirone's eyes—showing no fear even with a blade at his throat—was so infuriating it drove him nearly mad.

"What's wrong? You've suddenly gone silent. Don't tell me you're afraid I might actually kill you?"

Shirone focused his attention on the vibrations he felt beneath his chin.

His Spirit Zone was already active. The nature of Armand conveyed through synesthesia was truly bizarre.

Was this really a sword, or was it a living organism?

"Why aren't you answering? Aren't you supposed to be a genius mage?"

It was a petty remark to make after ambushing someone.

Of course, Shirone was confident he could deploy spatial teleportation faster than Zion's reaction speed. However, he couldn't guarantee he could avoid the magic sword flying through the air as well.

Interpreting Shirone's silence as an admission of defeat, Zion burst into laughter and withdrew his sword.

"Hahaha! As expected, it won't work, will it? My prediction was right. All those magazine articles were just exaggerated packaging. A mere student claiming to have the greatest talent..."

Woorin put her hands on her hips and spoke with a displeased expression.

"Brother, that's too harsh."

Zion paid no attention and threw Armand.

The magic sword, emitting a cold light, flew swiftly and stealthily back to its original position and stood upright.

Shirone belatedly realized there had been no stand supporting the sword from the beginning.

"Do you know why I don't kill you? Because you're not worth it. Even without me, there are plenty of people in the royal castle who hate you. You probably felt it, didn't you? This morning."

Shirone didn't understand what Zion meant. If he was talking about the morning, he had been busy with paternity tests, and there was nothing unusual besides that.

If he had to pick something, it would be that he couldn't contact Reina.

But if something had happened on that side, rumors should have already spread throughout the royal castle.

"What are you talking about? What about this morning?"

Then Zion tilted his head in confusion.

Although Shirone was disagreeable, Zion knew better than anyone that he wasn't stupid.

This meant that Reina, as his legal guardian, had blocked information from reaching Shirone in advance.

'Hmm, she's no ordinary person either.'

He had underestimated her for not being the family head, but she was a woman with better skills than expected. Well, that's probably why the Ozent family sent her.

In any case, she clearly didn't want last night's incident to surface.

Though she was an enemy, it was an excellent judgment.

"Hmph, now I see you're truly a pitiful fellow. In the end, even your allies don't trust you. You're probably the only one in the royal castle who doesn't know about last night's events."

Shirone asked indignantly, his emotions welling up.

"That's why I'm asking what happened!"

According to Zion's words, Reina knew about it. How could she know something that he didn't?

It wouldn't be a notification excluding him from full information. But he couldn't figure out what circumstances would prevent even Amy from being sent.

"Fine. I'll go ask directly myself."

Thinking he couldn't get answers from Zion, Shirone walked toward the door, but Woorin, who had been listening all along, spoke up.

"You probably won't be able to meet them even if you go. I heard they moved accommodations last night."

Shirone looked back at Woorin while gripping the door handle.

This was also the first time he'd heard this. What on earth was happening around him?

"Moved? Where to?"

"I didn't hear about that either. My brother's legal guardian added a disclosure prohibition clause at dawn. You'll probably find out if you go to the audience chamber."

She was telling him to go directly to the highest authority and ask.

Moreover, a disclosure prohibition clause. Though it wasn't a diplomatic tool with tremendous power, from Reina's position as the relatively weaker party, it was an aggressive response.

Finally sensing that the situation was serious, Shirone rushed out of the gallery without looking back.

An awkward silence fell over the gallery after Shirone left.

Zion glared at Woorin. Whether she knew about the sharp atmosphere piercing through the space or not, she was simply concentrating on drinking tea. Even if an hour passed like this, she wouldn't bat an eye. His sister was that kind of woman.

"Whose side are you on, exactly?"

"What are you suddenly talking about? Sides?"

Woorin asked back with an innocent expression.

Zion's anger finally exploded.

"Why are you being nice to Shirone? That bastard is my enemy! An enemy trying to steal the throne! Then naturally you should help me!"

Woorin felt burdened by his blatant demand.

"Why are you acting like this, brother? We've never had conversations like this before. Don't tell me you were nice to me expecting this? Because I'm Theraze's daughter?"

"No, it's not like that, but..."

Zion's face flushed hot.

People wouldn't know how humiliating it was to hear such words from his sister.

In fact, she helped just by existing.

Just presenting the business card of being Woorin's older brother, any noble would spare no support. With that tremendous firepower, he had eliminated countless enemies until now.

Woorin probably knew this. Yet she had never once brought it up.

That's what was good about it. But he never expected it would come back like a boomerang to stab him in the back.

'Tch! So this is how you're going to play it?'

Zion turned away with a bitter heart and huffed angrily through his nose.

In an atmosphere suggesting he would never speak to her again, Woorin sighed and stroked her sulking brother's back.

"Oh, really. Fine, I get it. Did you think I had no thoughts about it? It's just awkward to talk about these things between us. This is the number one reason why royalty splits apart. There's no one here who can threaten you anyway. What are you so afraid of?"

Zion suddenly wondered about that too.

What exactly was he afraid of?

Shirone was just an illegitimate child with no connections or foundation. All he had to show for himself was his meager reputation in the magic community. Archangel abilities? This was a royal castle teeming with even Great Magicians.

"Got it. I was narrow-minded. Sorry."

Zion immediately changed his stance. He felt good that his sister had understood his feelings.

After Woorin said a few more things that Zion had always wanted to hear, she returned to her seat.

Unlike Zion, whose mouth stretched to his ears, she looked exhausted and stopped pouring tea to let out a long sigh toward the ceiling.

'Sigh, men, really.'

**The Trap of False Dichotomy (1)**

Shirone went to the administrative department to request an audience.

Permission was granted in just ten minutes. It was such quick processing that it seemed like there had been instructions.

When he arrived at the audience chamber, a royal guard opened the door for him. Orcamp, dressed in formal attire, was waiting.

"I was just about to summon you. Come this way."

Shirone sat in the seat across from Orcamp.

While he was thinking about where to begin, Orcamp answered before receiving any questions.

"Your family's accommodation has been moved to the annex. Ask the manager to guide you there."

The quick explanation sounded almost like an excuse.

But he hadn't come to see the king just to find out about accommodations. What Shirone wanted to know was something more fundamental.

"What exactly am I not being told about?"

Orcamp sighed.

Being a king ultimately means occupying a dead-end position. Reina could have run away from difficult questions, but he couldn't.

"From yesterday evening until dawn, there were five assassination attempts. Three poisoning cases and two assassin incidents. Lethal doses of poison were detected in the food going to your family. At dawn, assassins were caught at one-hour intervals in the royal apartment. They committed suicide before we could investigate the mastermind, but anyone could tell they were targeting you."

Shirone felt like he'd been hit in the head with a hammer.

Assassination was something people committed. But it was so unexpected that it felt like experiencing a natural disaster.

"Why are they trying to kill us?"

"What do you mean? Did you think nothing would happen?"

Honestly speaking... yes, he had.

Of course, he hadn't been careless. But having the confidence that enemies would take action just two days after arriving at the royal castle was an entirely different matter.

"I don't know. Assassination of a First Prince candidate is a serious crime. If the mastermind were revealed, it wouldn't be enough even if their family were destroyed. Does it make sense to carry out such a major affair in just two days?"

"Do you think they're foolish? No, Shirone. Rather, this is a very rational and clever judgment. They're hitting a blind spot in thinking."

"A blind spot in... thinking?"

"Assassins are divided into two types: assassins and hitmen. Among the maxims of orthodox assassins, there's this one: 'It's not people who kill, but situations that kill.' You can dodge a sword if you see it coming. But you can't avoid situations. If they had to kill you anyway, yesterday was indeed the perfect opportunity."

Shirone corrected his error in thinking.

He hadn't forgotten about the danger of assassination. But on the other hand, he couldn't deny that the thought 'surely not now?' had been underlying everything.

"Assassins aren't those skilled with swords, but those adept at manipulating situations. That's why in the royal castle, one assassin is more frightening than a hundred guards. They hit blind spots in thinking. Once caught, you have no choice but to offer your neck even while knowing it."

Orcamp was right.

Why had he been at ease?

No, it wasn't even that level of misconception. You can't live checking every aspect of your thoughts. Even if he corrected one thought, they would have found another blind spot to exploit.

"Shirone, don't try to analyze everything with your head. The royal castle is a place crawling with beasts. No matter how great the cost of failure, there are no cowards here who miss their moment to act because they're afraid of it."

Orcamp rose from his seat and walked to his desk. Pouring strong liquor into a crystal glass, he said:

"Reina made a good judgment. In three days, you can become an official successor anyway. Fighting in the mud would only be a loss for us. So you should also pretend not to know."

Shirone clenched his fists.

He acknowledged that Reina's judgment was correct. But it had been a situation where even his parents could have died.

"Are you telling me to just take it? We could use this as grounds for counterattack."

Orcamp smiled bitterly.

"Then let me ask you. Who do you think is behind this?"

"Obviously the Theraze faction..."

Shirone stopped speaking.

Was it really only the Theraze faction targeting him? That too was a blind spot in thinking he hadn't examined until now.

"...I don't know."

"Right, it's unknowable. The change of a First Prince candidate is no exaggeration to say that all the kingdom's interests are at stake. Even without the Theraze faction, anyone has a motive to eliminate you."

Shirone tried to narrow down those on the list of suspects.

Countless faces flashed through his mind. Even Orcamp was among them...

"Does everyone want me dead?"

Orcamp returned to his seat with the crystal glass.

"If the mastermind is Theraze, it's a kind of warning. If it's the neutral faction, it would be to gauge your reaction. They want an accurate source to know what kind of person you are."

"A warning? It was a lethal dose of poison. If we had eaten it, we would have died. Even Amy, who came along innocently, almost died."

Orcamp gulped down the strong liquor. Shirone was getting too excited, but perhaps that was normal.

For ordinary people, assassination is too distant a concept. You might be robbed or hit by a carriage, but if you spent a day thinking that professional killers were targeting you, you'd go crazy within a month.

He had lived such a life. He had lived his entire life cohabitating with assassins while eating, using the bathroom, and having children. The fact that he could forget everything with a sip of strong liquor made him the abnormal one.
