"Shirone, even a beautiful butterfly is nothing but a hideous creature when seen up close. No one in this world is beautiful except for you, and expressing emotions is never a good thing. Especially if you want to protect those you love."

Shirone took a deep breath to calm his excitement. Now was the time to devise countermeasures rather than get angry.

"What should I do from now on?"

"Show your power. If they want to have criteria for judging whose side to stand on, providing them with an accurate source could be one method."

Orcamp finally spoke what was in his heart.

"I'll arrange a venue for you. Please demonstrate Ataraxia. If you show your power there, at least friend and foe will be clearly distinguished. Then they won't touch your family at the very least."

Shirone's gaze dropped downward. While his mind settled calmly, a hot energy flowed up his throat and caught in his neck.

"That's... the real reason you called me here."

Orcamp let out a small breath. As expected, lies didn't work on Shirone.

"Have you heard of Valkyrie? It's an army organized by Theraze in preparation for the final war. The Kingdom of Kasula was able to survive economically thanks to receiving orders for war weapons from there. But the situation isn't optimistic. The reason Theraze planted their children here is to eventually drive me out and devour Kasula. We need to strengthen our influence within Valkyrie even more. With your Ataraxia, it's definitely possible."

Shirone felt the strength drain from his body. He had vaguely suspected it, but hearing these words from someone he considered his biological parent made tears leak out.

In the end, blood ties weren't what mattered. What they wanted was Ataraxia, the archangel's ability.

"Please. Demonstrate it. Just showing it in front of the nobles will have tremendous impact. It's an opportunity to draw the Neutral Faction to our side."

Shirone struggled to swallow his falling tears. Since Orcamp wasn't crying, he shouldn't cry either.

"Did you think I would obediently comply if you said that?"

"Actually, quite the opposite. That's why I'm thinking of making a proposal. Previously, you said you wanted to return home. Is that thought still valid?"

"No, it's not valid. I want to return home even more than I did then."

Orcamp wasn't displeased even by Shirone's sarcastic words.

"If you demonstrate for us, I'll send you home as soon as the paternity confirmation is complete. You can attend magic school or do whatever you want. If you don't want to come to the royal castle, you don't have to. How about it?"

Even Shirone couldn't just pass by this proposal.

After actually experiencing the royal castle, contrary to his initial thoughts, returning home wasn't as simple as he had imagined. In such a situation, Orcamp's proposal was certainly tempting.

"But then you won't be able to use Ataraxia. Eventually you'll need me, so how do you plan to persuade the ministers?"

Orcamp felt anxious as if his true intentions had been discovered. The reason he proposed the demonstration was for a much bigger purpose than drawing in the Neutral Faction.

Arius had said that if he could see Ataraxia directly, he would be able to find a way to replicate it.

Once replication succeeded, Shirone would be unnecessary. No, rather, it would be better for him to leave the royal castle. For Shirone's own life...

"That's why a secret deal is necessary. I'll announce to the ministers that you'll return after graduating from magic school. One year, was it? During that time, I'll purge Theraze's faction. After that, we can each go our separate ways."

In the end, it meant the deal would be nullified if he couldn't purge Theraze's faction.

But Shirone nodded as if that level of risk was natural. As long as one year was guaranteed, it didn't matter whether the promise was kept or not.

He was planning to move his residence after graduating from magic school anyway. He could just think of the moving distance as being a bit farther.

At least until he built up enough power not to be shaken by royal authority, couldn't he live that way?

"Who will observe the demonstration?"

"I've already sent word. All the high nobles will gather. They're expecting a spectacular show."

Shirone looked at Orcamp with sad eyes.

"You knew from the beginning that I couldn't refuse."

"Shirone, it's a proposal you requested first three days ago. I merely created justification to allow it."

Orcamp was cold until the very end.

But thanks to that, Shirone also regained his composure. It wouldn't be for Kasula's sake. He intended to do it for his family.

"Alright. Please call me when preparations are complete. I should go meet my 'parents' now."

He wanted to just walk out. He also knew that even if he did so, Orcamp wouldn't scold him.

But Shirone left the room courteously.

Orcamp was the king of a neighboring country.

Upon arriving at his lodging, Shirone first checked on his parents' wellbeing.

Their eyes were sunken as if they hadn't slept all night. Though they were trying to smile to avoid worrying their child, Olina's face was as pale as white paper.

Even he, who had learned magic, had his heart pounding wildly, so it must have been too great a burden for her who had lived her entire life without harming anyone.

'I'm sorry, Mother.'

Amy, who welcomed Shirone, neither tried to act bright nor showed a tense expression. She simply gave a bitter smile and raised her hand in greeting.

From her appearance, Shirone felt deep camaraderie.

Reina, who had been meeting with attendants in the next room, greeted him with a bright expression.

"You're here, Shirone. I was waiting for you."

While everyone else was haggard, only Reina was full of vitality. She certainly seemed well-seasoned in the royal castle atmosphere, befitting a court musician.

Though it was refreshing to see this new side of her, his mood wasn't particularly good at this moment.

It wasn't that he disliked her. But no one would understand the feelings of someone who had become a fool for a day while leaving his family's lives in someone else's hands.

"I met with Orcamp."

Reina's expression hardened.

Not only because of Shirone's cold voice, but also from seeing him call the king by name, she could guess how angry he was about this incident.

"I'm sorry for not telling you in advance. But I was worried you might be concerned..."

"I understand the reason. But everyone was in a dangerous situation."

Reina gulped. It was the expression that only appeared when Shirone was truly angry, which she had seen once at her family home.

Now that she was on the receiving end, it felt like her heart was freezing. Had her father felt this way back then too?

"It's okay now. I've strengthened security procedures. I requested the guard unit to further enhance security..."

"You should have informed me."

Reina's mouth closed like a clam. Then Amy, who had been watching like a bystander, let out a sigh.

'That's what I said we should tell him.'

This mess happened because they overlooked how much Shirone loved his family.

But honestly, Amy was in no position to say anything either. Even though she had clearly anticipated Shirone's reaction, she had followed Reina's judgment because ultimately her thinking was correct.

He was getting this angry now, but if he had known at the time, the situation could have spiraled out of control. Shirone couldn't be unaware of this fact. That's why it was ultimately Reina's victory.

Vincent, unable to hide his embarrassment, tried to calm Shirone.

"Shirone, Reina was in a position where she had no choice. Besides, she made the decision after sufficiently asking for our understanding. Rather, get angry at me."

Shirone bowed his head. He had known that from the beginning.

He was just angry.

His family was suffering under assassination threats, the people who were supposedly his biological parents were obsessed with Ataraxia, and now even Reina was excluding himâ€”thinking about it made him feel miserably dejected to the point of shuddering.

"I'm sorry. I know that Reina saved all of us. I just... was so frustrated that I acted that way without realizing it."

Reina detected a faint sobbing in Shirone's voice. What on earth had he heard from Orcamp that this usually strong child had returned in such tatters?

"No, I'm sorry. It was certainly something to feel hurt about. Informing you was also one of my duties. I'll report everything without fail from now on."

When Shirone forced a smile, Reina also felt relieved.

Indeed, this child was most beautiful when smiling. That's why she didn't want to see his sad face even more.

To safely leave the royal castle, one had to be cold-hearted. If the same situation arose, Reina intended to make the exact same judgment.

Once the two people's emotions were settled, Amy asked.

"So what did you talk about in the audience chamber?"

"Oh, that's..."

Shirone told them about Orcamp's proposal. Amy thought carefully and then nodded.

"Hmm, it's a decent proposal. Of course, assuming he keeps his promise."

"It doesn't matter. We'll have to move anyway after graduation. The next problem can be thought about when the time comes. So I accepted the proposal for now."

"Right. Same for me."

The reason nobles have the concept of a family home is because they move their residence according to their work.

Amy's older brother Diane was also serving as archery captain at the royal castle, and especially her second brother Ares, who was an explorer, was traveling through remote regions so it was unclear which country he was currently in.

Globally, the employment rate for mages was about 80 percent, and the hire rate approached 99 percent. The reason the employment rate was lower than the hire rate was because quite many mages refused job positions.

But competition was fierce accordingly, so most students went up to the capital Bashka after graduation to look for jobs or prepare for certification exams. When both weren't feasible, it was frequent for them to study abroad in other countries.

Though Creas also had magical institutions, Shirone also had no intention of ending his magical career in a provincial city.

In the future, if he reached about certified 5th-grade, he could be appointed as deputy director of the Magic Association's Creas branch, but right now he had many things he wanted to do.

Alpheas Magic School was a nationally designated institution, and upon graduation, one received an uncertified 10th-grade mage certificate. Once the certificate was obtained, guilds would provide work, so mercenary life was also possible. Then there would be no need to purchase a house, making it convenient to move around.

Living that way, if he met good connections, he thought he could settle down somewhere.

Amy clapped as if supporting Shirone's intention and pumped him up with encouragement.

"Good! If we're going to do it, let's do it properly!"

@

The Colosseum was built in a basin area 2 kilometers north of Kasula's royal castle. In the past, it had been a massive gambling den where gladiators fought bloody battles with wild beasts while nobles placed bets, but currently it was indefinitely closed due to the royal castle's financial situation.

On the unsorted sandy floor, traces of blood remained. No matter how much the workers swept with brooms, the red bloodstains wouldn't disappear.

Nobles entered with their escorts, and Amy and Reina also took seats in the third-floor viewing area.

Orcamp had permitted the parents' observation out of consideration for Shirone's feelings, but since Olina's mind and body were in a weakened state, they decided to leave her at the lodging with Vincent.

Shirone was waiting in the underground waiting room of the Colosseum for the time to come.

Around him were exercise equipment and sandbags that champions had used, scattered about, and various weapons were displayed on shelves.

The iron door of the waiting room opened and Zion and Woorin entered. Woorin looked around as if it was her first time in the underground waiting room.

Shirone no longer welcomed anyone. After learning about last night's incident, everyone looked like enemies.

Zion approached with a swaggering gait and spoke.

"Truly a desolate place. What did the warriors who waited here think about? Please don't let me be eaten by lions? Or perhaps they were plotting to break down that door and escape."

"No, they must have resolved to definitely kill their enemies. That's the only path left for a warrior."

Zion made a twisted smile. As expected, he was no match for a mage in words.
