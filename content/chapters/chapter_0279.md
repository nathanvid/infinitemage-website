"Hmph, your mouth is still as sharp as ever. What's the reason for putting on this clown show? Did father promise to make you king later or something?"

"I told you clearly. I'm not interested."

Zion turned around without even listening properly and began walking along the wall, taking in the scenery of the waiting room.

Actually, today's demonstration schedule had been unexpected for him too. He hadn't thought Orcamp would challenge him to a real sword duel so quickly.

But it meant that side was also quite pressed for time.

After making a large circle around the waiting room and arriving back in front of Shirone, Zion made an enticing proposal.

"I'll send you home."

Shirone looked puzzled and asked back.

"What are you talking about?"

"You said you're not interested in the position of First Prince, right? Then what you'd gain from this demonstration is freedom. And I'm saying I'll give you that. No matter how much you avoid the eyes of Kasula's royal castle, you can't avoid the eyes of Theraze. Because we operate globally. But if I send you away? Kasula becomes mine and you gain your freedom. It's good for both of us, isn't it?"

It was a temptation sweet enough to be hard to refuse. But it wasn't something to accept easily.

Empress Theraze had planted Zion to devour Kasula. Therefore, if Zion became king, Orcamp and Eliza would die. Without cutting off the royal family's legitimacy, they couldn't plan for the future.

"What do you want me to do?"

"Simple. Ruin the show. That archangel ability or whatever, just mess it up. And tell the nobles this: actually, the rumors were exaggerated, I just got lucky, someone as insignificant as me can't perform such magic."

Shirone nodded in understanding.

Today's demonstration was a political stage. Whether the nobles believed the lie or not, the moment he raised the white flag, the game would be over.

However, what weighed on his mind was the deaths of Orcamp and Eliza. Was it really okay to do that?

No matter how much they had abandoned their child, they had at least kept him alive. Did he have the right to repay even that tiny bit of kindness with death?

"I'll think about it. No, give me time to think."

"Take all the time you need. Either way, I'll hear your answer in the colosseum. Whichever you choose, Kasula is destined to fall to me anyway. Make a wise decision."

As Shirone lowered his head, he heard the sound of Zion leaving. But his mind was too complicated to pay attention.

If he helped Orcamp, he'd be hunted by Theraze's faction for life. But if he sided with Zion, Orcamp and Eliza would die.

'What should I do? What exactly am I supposed to do?'

Woorin, who had finished retrieving her pet cat that had been wandering around the waiting room and was ready to leave, said goodbye to Shirone.

"Take care, brother."

Shirone looked up at Woorin with lifeless eyes. She probably knew about his dilemma. But she offered no advice other than words of comfort.

He tried to convey his desperate feelings with earnest eyes, but she tilted her head as if she knew nothing and smiled.

Shirone looked down at the ground with a resigned expression.

What exactly was he hoping for? There couldn't be anyone in the royal castle who would help him, could there?

At that moment, Woorin let out a sigh.

"Haa."

And in a calm, settled voice, she said:

"Do you want me to help you, brother?"

Shirone raised his head again.

Woorin was still beautiful. But the bright feeling that had been evident just moments before had disappeared.

"Of course, I could help you."

Woorin stepped back a couple of paces as if reestablishing distance.

"But I might not help you either. What's important is plausibility. For example, suppose there's a wealthy person who owns 100 billion gold. That person wouldn't mind giving away 1 gold to just anyone. But they don't do that. Not because the money is precious, but because there's no plausibility. If they gave 1 gold to someone for no reason, they'd eventually have to give 1 gold to everyone in the world. You don't have plausibility yet, brother. So you need to create a reason why I must help you."

"What should I... how should I do that?"

"That's also your responsibility. You might lose a lot in this demonstration. But it's also an opportunity to gain something more precious. I hope you make a wise choice."

With those words, Woorin headed toward the door. Shirone couldn't see the beautiful smile he had expected until the very end.

Left alone in the waiting room, Shirone fell into thought. He was analyzing her words left at the last moment of this false dichotomy.

'I see.'

Losing many things referred to the material losses that would occur if he gave up the First Prince position. Conversely, gaining something precious meant the lives of Orcamp and Eliza.

If Zion became king of Kasula, Woorin would also have plausibility to help him.

In other words, she was saying this: she would guarantee his birth parents' lives if he handed the throne over to Zion.

'Yes, that's enough.'

Shirone decided to ruin the show.

Orcamp would probably be disappointed, but since he'd be saving his life as a result, he would have fulfilled his responsibility as a son.

The lamp on the ceiling lit up and a loud siren sounded.

Having organized his thoughts, Shirone entered the elevator installed on the wall. When he pulled the switch, the elevator rose to the surface with clanking sounds.

What he saw upon reaching the surface was enclosed darkness and only iron bars installed 10 meters ahead.

Though the sunlight was weak since it was before sunset, the champions of long ago would have looked at the intense midday sun and renewed their hopes for life.

The iron bars rose up, and Shirone walked toward the center of the colosseum.

Zion's words about a clown show were right. As countless gazes fixed on him, he felt as if he had been stripped naked.

The target stood in the direction of the setting sun. It seemed hastily found as a last resortâ€”a shabby wooden board if there ever was one.

Not even a slingshot target, and they expected magic to hit that? If the intention was mockery, it was perfect.

He almost snorted thinking about how there must have been power struggles even in choosing a single target.

"We will now begin the qualification verification for the First Prince candidate."

Qualification verification for the First Prince candidate. It was certainly a good excuse for setting up a clown.

Shirone paid his respects to Orcamp and said:

"Your Majesty, magic is a powerful force. There's a risk that property might be damaged if I'm not careful. I'd like to ask for your understanding first."

It meant the precious target might break. It was a jab at those mocking him.

Orcamp quickly understood and supported Shirone's intention.

"Don't worry about it. The target is just an excuse. As long as you can demonstrate your abilities, you may do whatever you wish."

Shirone felt satisfied at having gotten one over on them. But in the end, this was all he could do.

Feeling slightly self-deprecating, he turned toward the target. With everyone holding their breath, he concentrated and cast Halo.

Starlike intense light embedded itself in space and began slowly moving to draw a huge circle.

He had to draw it as large as possible.

After the 2,000-round duel ended, Amy had told him that Halo could shock those with sensitive perception. Then it would surely work on someone here.

It might be meaningless resistance, but without doing what he could, he couldn't create any variables.

Finally, as the Halo was completed, a brilliantly shining ring of light appeared.

Amy quickly surveyed the surroundings.

First, Reina frowned. If she could feel pressure from the Halo, it meant her Schema sensitivity was considerable.

On the other hand, the nobles were calm. Most nobles at the center of power were from administrative backgrounds, so they were distant from Schema or Spirit Zone.

But those protecting them were different. Without exception, they were desperately gritting their teeth.

'Hmm, they're definitely strong...'

Zion and Woorin didn't seem particularly shocked.

Since Amy hadn't expected anything from the start anyway, she looked toward where Orcamp was.

More precisely, at the tall man standing behind Orcamp.

Though many masters existed in this place, no one had as high a tension level as that man. Moreover, he was still covering his face with his right hand as if he couldn't adapt.

'Damn it! That startled me.'

Arius decided to believe in the existence of souls. The moment the ring of light was born, he felt something in his head fly outward. It was such a terrible shock.

Since joining the Seven Deadly Sins, he had never been mentally stunned for more than a second, so this was surprising.

'He's implemented Immortal Function in form. Is that the basic mental structure of Nephilim?'

Having finished analyzing the Halo, Arius waited calmly. Through this demonstration, he planned to understand the mechanism and find a way to break the encapsulation. As Ataraxia began to be integrated, his eyes shone intensely.

'It's started! First is the false dichotomy. Is it binary-based?'

Starting with the first magic circle embedding in the center of the Halo, a shower of light rushed in.

The nobles admired the spectacular sight, but Arius organized every single concept being integrated into Ataraxia without missing any.

'Algebra. Musho geometry. Multiple operation equations. Vanessa's theorem. Spherical integration. Eisen relativity. And that one is... Hegel's paradox?'

As concepts accumulated in Ataraxia, his thinking began to overload. His head felt like it would explode.

When the integration process passed the halfway point, even the Zeta function, the cutting edge of human intelligence, appeared. It was a kind of hypothesis presumed to contain the blueprint of the universe as a formula for discovering patterns in prime numbers.

Arius stopped thinking. No, he couldn't think.

From the Zeta function onward, everything was concepts he'd never seen before, and they were embedding into the Halo at tremendous speed.

Analysis impossible.

'Damn it...'

As the integration ended, Ataraxia was born as a colorful, comprehensive concept. It was the reality of a super-magic amplification circle that humans could never implement.

Arius shuddered with a sense of defeat.

He had only understood 65 percent of the entire circuit. Compared to when Shirone had given up at the 17 percent point during his possession with Ikael, this was an incredible level of intelligence, but not knowing even 1 percent was the same as not knowing anything.

Shirone stared at the Ataraxia floating before his eyes and fell into thought. From now on, his life would change depending on what he chose.

After about 10 seconds passed, the nobles who had been watching intently gradually lost interest.

Knowing how important one second was in actual combat, they were merely disappointed by Shirone's inexperience.

"What is he doing? If he's going to do it, do it; if not, then don't."

"His personality is indecisive. Or does he need more preparation?"

The nobles who commanded great magicians had no patience for a student-level demonstration. As complaints arose from here and there, Zion added his voice too.

"Haha! Rumors are always greatly exaggerated. With so many high-level magicians in the royal castle, how could a mere magic student wannabe receive verification with this?"

Then those presumed to be from Theraze's faction each added their own comments.

Letting them handle the atmosphere themselves, Zion looked down at Shirone arrogantly.

The stage was all set now. All that remained was for Shirone to confess his inadequacy.

Shirone listened to the voices coming from all directions. As expected, most were Zion's cronies.

'Right, let's quit. From the beginning, this enemy was too strong for me to handle.'

Shirone weakly dropped his shoulders and opened his mouth.

"I am..."

The first words of a momentous announcement came out, but the nobles' murmuring showed no signs of stopping.

Realizing his voice was too quiet, Shirone took a deep breath and filled his lungs with air so everyone could hear.

'Wait...'

Then suddenly, a strange thought occurred to him.

Was giving up really the right decision?

It was a thought that arose suddenlyâ€”not from his head, but pushed up from his body.
