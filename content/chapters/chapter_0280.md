title: Chapter 280 - The Trap of False Dichotomy (4)
date: 2025-08-30

Throughout his entire life, he had never made judgments based on what others possessed. That eighteen years of inertia had sounded the alarm bell of doubt.

Only then did his mind finally start working.

This was the trap of false dichotomy. No matter what he chose, it would be a fight that Zion would win.

The terrifying aspect of false dichotomy logic lies in how it blocks off possibilities outside the given choices in advance. By presenting something bad and something worse, then inducing someone to choose the bad option, it creates the illusion of gaining an advantage when in reality, one is merely dancing in the enemy's palm.

Shirone realized he had misunderstood Woorin's words.

No one gives away 1 gold without reason. In other words, that meant there would be no one to help those who give up.

It had been a delusion to think that the Theraze faction would spare his life if he begged with a servile expression.

The royal castle is a den of beasts. Showing weakness would only result in having even the flesh clinging to his bones torn away and devoured.

That was what Woorin had wanted to say.

If you want to live, bare your fangs. Show your teeth and growl. Swing your claws so that no one thinks you're easy prey.

The moment you stop fighting, all the beasts in the royal castle will come running to devour you.

"Huuuuuu!"

Shirone finally exhaled.

He didn't know how long he had been holding his breath, but air poured out endlessly. It felt as if even all the miscellaneous thoughts in his head were being expelled.

As his mind cleared, his target became distinctly visible.

Shirone properly positioned himself and took a stance to cast magic. But the nobles were still sneering dismissively.

In their minds, if Shirone had any sense, he should have deployed his techniques quickly and flashily somehow.

His magical skill was for experts to judge, and what they wanted to confirm was Shirone's will. With such a lukewarm attitude, he couldn't persuade any noble.

But Shirone didn't care.

He would become a beast.

With that thought, as he concentrated his mind, a Photon Cannon exploded into existence in front of him.

Shirone compressed the photons endlessly. The sphere of light violently shook as it repeated contraction and expansion.

Amy realized that the Photon Cannon's casting was taking much longer than usual and felt chilled.

In the Two Thousand Times battle, even when his mental strength was nearly depleted, it had enough power to crash the system. She couldn't even imagine what results would occur if the strongest Photon Cannon passed through Ataraxia.

'Still not enough. This won't satisfy my anger!'

Shirone continued compressing the sphere of light.

From the beginning, there had been neither enemies nor allies in this place. The Theraze faction, the Orcamp faction—they were all only thinking of using him.

'More... more!'

Tears welled up. Three days' worth of memories came flooding back all at once.

When he recalled the image of his mother's frightened face, the Photon Cannon compressed rapidly and transformed into a state of white light that could no longer accept any more photons. The Photon Cannon, about the size of a human head, shook violently as if it might break free from its focal point.

Amy shot up from her seat. It was too extreme, and dangerous in that its future couldn't be predicted.

But before she could shout to Shirone, the Photon Cannon penetrated through Ataraxia. Having already experienced this in the Two Thousand Times battle, she squeezed her eyes shut and twisted her body.

Flash!

A massive tunnel of light appeared in front of Shirone, pushing away everything in its path. Even the atmosphere itself.

A thunderous roar erupted, paralyzing people's eardrums, and the intense light instantly erased their vision.

Everything was dark for a while.

As their eyes adapted to the scenery, the world that was revealed was completely different from what it had been a second before. Not only the inner walls of the colosseum but even the distant mountain ridge had vanished. Particles decomposed into dust floated above the ground like an enormous smokescreen.

When the wind pushed away the dust, the trail of the Photon Cannon finally appeared. A flat plain wide enough for dozens of carriages to pass through stretched to the horizon.

The nobles were surrounded by high-ranking mages. Swordsmen stood guard around the mages who were scowling and maintaining powerful localized barriers. If Shirone had shown even the slightest suspicious movement, they would have leaped into the colosseum.

"Such insolence! What do you think you're doing!"

A fat noble slammed down his chair and shot to his feet. The other nobles were equally furious.

What would have happened if he had cast magic toward the spectator seats?

The swordsmen would have beheaded Shirone the moment he turned in that direction, but that was merely a matter of regulations. In reality, hadn't they themselves let their guard down, thinking it was just a student demonstration?

The fat noble hurled a string of curses at Shirone. However, at the words of a wolf-like noble sitting beside him, he quickly shut his mouth and sat back down.

This was already a venue approved by Orcamp. To rebel here would be tantamount to exposing their identity.

"That, that bastard..."

Zion trembled with rage.

Not only had Shirone chewed up and spat out his proposal like a piece of gum, but the terrifying power of his magic had shattered his pride to pieces.

How could it possibly make sense for a human to push away a mountain?

No, even if it were possible, that would be at the level of a Great Magician.

For a mere aspiring mage to wield such ability spoke to how unfair the human world was.

Though Zion had refused to be equal with anyone until now, at this moment he couldn't bear the jealousy.

Power that exceeded one's station should belong only to royalty. If such power was given to some bastard without authority, wealth, or status, how could a nation possibly endure?

"I've clearly heard your answer, Shirone. We'll see about this!"

Zion shouted loud enough for everyone to hear and headed for the exit. A large group of nobles followed behind him.

It was probably the Theraze group, but Shirone didn't care. He was just struggling to hold onto his consciousness, which felt like it might fly away from the aftershock of casting a full-power Photon Cannon.

This was the first time he hadn't collapsed after casting Ataraxia. It was partly due to his increased endurance, but it was also proof that he was enduring with such fierce determination.

Shirone turned his head with intense eyes. Woorin was still remaining in her seat. But her reaction was merely raising an eyebrow slightly and pulling up the corner of her mouth in a mocking smile.

Rising from her seat, she whispered something to her cat and left the colosseum without lingering.

**Midnight Ball (1)**

Orcamp's footsteps were faster than usual.

Though he wasn't one to get excited easily, this time it was difficult to control his emotions.

Only after pushing through the door to his study and gulping down the water on his desk could he calm his mind.

Ataraxia.

It was truly a catastrophic magic. No, was it really surprising at this point?

What he had witnessed was the ability of an archangel, the supreme commander of Heaven. And he had heard that Heaven had seven more archangels with equivalent power.

Suddenly, he felt doubtful.

Could the Valkyries really handle them?

'Enough. Don't look too far ahead. In any case, this is good for me.'

If he could just replicate Ataraxia, joining the 'Holy War'—the supreme national representatives' gathering of Valkyries—wouldn't be a dream.

The twelve most powerful rulers in the world.

Though the position in the 'Three Emperors' realm, where Empress Theraze belonged, might be impossible, the 'Seven Stars' below that was certainly worth coveting.

If that happened, even Theraze would have no choice but to acknowledge Kasula's independence.

What would it feel like to control the world's economy, culture, society, life, knowledge, and arts at will? Orcamp was already imagining such things.

"How was it?"

When Orcamp asked, Arius appeared from the corner of the study.

This kind of entrance was unpleasant from a ruler's perspective, but Arius was stubbornly eccentric in strange ways.

But today, unlike before, he wasn't being theatrical. His face was flushed with excitement, no less than Orcamp's.

"Certainly impressive. Ataraxia—what a magnificent ability."

"That's not what I'm asking about. Can you replicate it now?"

"It's impossible."

Orcamp thought he had misheard. But his ears were working fine.

He tried to suppress his surging anger, but it was far from calming.

Until now, he had done everything Arius demanded. He had even pushed through with the demonstration while stabbing a dagger into his child's heart.

"Why can't it be done? Is it encapsulation again?"

"That's the primary cause, yes. But even if we unraveled the encapsulation, it would be the same. Ataraxia is an ability that transcends human concepts. In short, even Shirone himself doesn't know about it."

"Does that make any sense? I saw with my own two eyes Shirone casting Ataraxia clearly. Are you saying Shirone isn't human?"

"In a sense, yes. Something that isn't human is contained within a human body. Shirone doesn't understand and cast Ataraxia either. How about I explain it this way? It just works."

Orcamp's eyes grew coldly calm.

"Speak plainly. This answer must convince me without fail."

Sensing the killing intent, Arius finally dropped his smile.

"The most likely possibility is that Ataraxia is engraved in the very depths of Shirone's unconscious. Probably close to instinct. In that case, it wouldn't be strange for Shirone to use the ability without knowing the principle. We don't understand how to breathe before we breathe."

"Instinct, you say. Then couldn't we extract it from there?"

"Well. Instinct is what we call primordial consciousness—an area determined at the genetic level. No matter how professional a grave robber I am, it's impossible to Dive that deep. No, to be precise, Diving is possible, but I would be crushed to death by Shirone's unconscious."

Orcamp slammed his desk.

All he'd been doing was saying it couldn't be done. Moreover, now he was saying he couldn't Dive because his life was precious.

"Do you think I hired you just to listen to such drivel? If we can't obtain Ataraxia...!"

"There is one method."

Orcamp's expression changed as if nothing had happened.

Indeed, one of the Seven Deadly Sins of the Black Line wouldn't be bragging about his incompetence without any countermeasures.

"I apologize for not mentioning it earlier. But this could be a troublesome method. Perhaps Your Highness will also need to prepare yourself."

"I'm always prepared. What method is it?"

Arius looked around, then whispered in his ear. Usually, he didn't care whether Eliza was eavesdropping or not, but this time it was better to be cautious.

"What, what did you say?"

Orcamp's eyes widened in shock. Meanwhile, Arius's eyes narrowed like a snake's.

When he had been smiling, it wasn't noticeable, but with his expression gone, his face resembled that of a viper.

"It's the only way."

Orcamp gripped the desk with trembling hands.

"That, that can't be done. Do you know what that means?"

"Of course. But with this method, we can definitely obtain Ataraxia."

Orcamp exhaled roughly.

Obtaining Ataraxia. Possessing an ability designated as Triple-S by the Valkyries.

Kasula's independence. The Seven Stars. Various thoughts flashed through his mind.

"But... must we really go that far?"

"Your Highness, as I've said repeatedly, we don't have time. This is when a quick decision is needed."

Orcamp shook his head.

He needed time. Even if he proceeded with the plan, how would he handle the aftermath that would follow? He would need to prepare countermeasures for that as well.

"Just give me a little, just a little time to think."

Arius's face twisted viciously. But when Orcamp looked up, he had returned to his smiling appearance as if nothing had happened.

"Naturally, this requires time to consider. I understand. Please call me when you're certain."

Arius bowed respectfully and left the study.

Walking quickly down the corridor, he leaned his back against a wall where no one was around and spat out curses.

"Tch, stupid bastard. Pathetic fool. What a loser."

Of course, Orcamp's reaction was normal. After calling back the bloodline he'd found after eighteen years, making him endure all kinds of humiliation and insults, and now trying to steal away the most precious thing.

But there should be no limits to a king's ruthlessness. This is okay and that isn't—having such barriers in judgment ultimately meant having a small vessel.

Once you start hesitating, you can't have anything. Even if you follow the proposal belatedly, guilt will disturb your mind. Such people would eventually ruin everything.

'How disappointing, Orcamp. I thought you were a ruthless ruler, but you're no different from any common noble.'
