Most of the Black Line members are wanted criminals. Especially the Seven Deadly Sins, who are branded as notorious global criminals, require absolutely safe hideouts if they wish to stay in one place.

Working under such a incompetent master would surely lead to having one's neck on the guillotine soon enough. When his thoughts reached that point, he couldn't help but worry about his own safety.

"Hmm, shall I start wrapping things up here?"

The reason Arius had avoided capture by Red Line's bounty hunters despite their relentless pursuit was thanks to his animal-like sixth sense for knowing when to strike and when to retreat.

His instincts, honed by over ten years of fugitive life, were now warning him that it would be dangerous if he didn't leave soon.

'But it would be such a waste to end things like this...'

Ataraxia. The greatest catch of his grave robber career had fallen into his net.

While material value played a part in his decision to become a grave robber, what drove him more was satisfying an Unlocker's intellectual desires.

In that sense, the archangel Ikael's ability was definitely something that whetted his appetite.

'Should I pretend to be crazy and dive to the first level? No, that's impossible alone. Especially since a mage's unconscious is much stronger than an ordinary person's. But I can't ally myself with Orcamp either.'

Arius, who had been lost in thought with his chin propped on his hand, slowly raised his head. He looked around the empty corridor and spoke with a thin smile.

"What brings you here?"

A nameless administrator who was one of Zion's subordinates emerged from around the corner, naturally drawing a sneer from Arius. The administrator was neither a mage nor an assassin. But as always, his presence couldn't be felt until he chose to reveal himself.

"There is someone who wishes to meet with Lord Arius."

Arius knew it was Zion. But the administrator didn't reveal his master's name.

It wouldn't be good for anyone to know that Arius, Orcamp's subordinate, and Zion, a core member of the Theraze faction, were secretly meeting to make deals.

"What a welcome proposal to hear. Please lead the way."

As the administrator turned and began walking, Arius watched the old man's Achilles heel.

He walked briskly without making even a sound.

He appeared as light as a cat, but the calf muscles hidden beneath his robes must have been tremendously developed.

That didn't mean he was some great master though. If anything, it was the craftsmanship of someone who had devoted his entire life to serving his master.

'Heh heh, what an interesting place this is. The royal castle.'

@

"Damn it! That bastard completely made a fool of me!"

The glass bottle Zion threw shattered against the gallery door. Glass fragments scattered everywhere and a cat that had been sleeping on the floor leaped away.

Regardless, Woorin sat at the table and brought her teacup to her lips.

"Why? I thought it was good. It was spectacular."

Zion glared at his younger sister.

Her oblivious personality was usually cute, but in situations like this, it was infuriating to death.

"I need to step in personally. I can't just leave Shirone alone."

Woorin stroked the chin of the cat that had climbed onto her lap and said, "He was threatening though. What would have happened if he had cast magic toward the spectator seats?"

Zion's face reddened as he recalled the situation.

As Woorin said, it had been tremendously powerful. No matter how high-level the security guards were, there would have been casualties.

"That's exactly it! He declared war! It must have been revenge for me pointing my sword at him!"

"That seems a bit much though? Maybe he was just angry."

"It's the same thing either way! That lowly thing ignored my proposal! I won't let him get away with it!"

Just then, someone knocked on the gallery door.

Intuiting that it was Arius, Zion calmed his excitement and returned to the table where his sister sat.

"Come in."

Arius opened the door and entered. This was the only place where he could meet Zion away from prying eyes, but the atmosphere seemed particularly tense today. Jumping over the glass fragments scattered on the floor, he offered a polite greeting.

"It's been a while, First Prince. Ah, the young lady is here as well."

Zion snorted dismissively. In the current situation, even the title of First Prince was nothing but an empty shell.

"Sit down first. We have things to discuss."

As Arius gestured for permission and sat in a chair, Woorin poured him tea.

Receiving the teacup with both hands, he looked at Zion and asked, "What did you call me for? Have you grown tired of the Objet I procured for you last time?"

Woorin waved her finger in correction.

"Hey, you didn't procure it for us. You clearly sold it for money."

"Haha! Strictly speaking, that's true. But you know that it's not something money can buy, don't you? Objets, that is."

Zion didn't want to engage in trivial small talk.

"The Objet isn't the problem."

"Oh, then what is?"

"Don't play dumb when you obviously know! Now it's become clear. The reason father called Shirone to the royal castle. It's to grave rob Ataraxia, isn't it?"

"It's Ataraxia, not Arcraxia. And grave robbing? If you're going to say it, please call it extraction."

Zion took a deep breath and calmed his mind. If he got caught up in Arius's shameless conversation, they wouldn't reach the main point even if a whole day passed.

"So... how far has that plan progressed?"

"Hmm, even for the First Prince, that's difficult. After all, I'm also bound to His Majesty, so I can't reveal confidential information."

Zion extended his hand northward. As Armand flew toward him as if being sucked in and stuck to his hand, he immediately swung it to point at Arius's neck.

"I'm not joking around right now, you know? You'd better speak properly."

Arius sipped his tea leisurely, as if he had finally relaxed now that the sword was pointed at him.

But many thoughts were racing through his mind.

Zion was nothing but an ill-mannered brat. On the other hand, Armand was a troublesome weapon. While he had procured it himself, it was truly a waste for such an incompetent royal to possess it.

"If you're asking how far it's progressed... about 49 percent, I'd say?"

It wasn't a lie. All things are half-done when they begin, and since they hadn't even started yet, 49 percent was appropriate.

Woorin, understanding the meaning, let out a snicker, but Zion seemed to think considerable progress had been made and pressed with a surprised expression.

"Stop it absolutely. No, eliminate Ataraxia completely. As a grave robber, that should be possible, right?"

Arius exhaled through his nose.

What a pathetic fool. How could a mere king eliminate the ability of an archangel who had crossed over from another world?

Ataraxia was humanity's treasure that should be analyzed someday, even if he didn't grave rob it himself.

"As I said again, I am employed by His Majesty, so..."

"I'll pay you any amount of money."

Arius closed his mouth.

He had made enormous profits dealing with Zion so far. Of course, he enjoyed grave robbing itself more than money, but he was going to part ways with Orcamp anyway. If he could make one last big score before leaving, couldn't he secure something like severance pay?

"Hmm."

Lost in thought, Arius finally revealed his true nature.

As his cold serpent's eyes appeared, Zion felt goosebumps even while pointing his sword.

But the pupils hidden in Arius's narrow eyes were directed not at Zion, but at Woorin.

'Beautiful.'

It wasn't an emotion one should feel toward a fourteen-year-old girl, but she was truly magnificent. With her mysterious appearance plus the aura of Theraze, she was truly a tempting fruit.

He had analyzed the minds of countless people, but Woorin was the only one whose thoughts he couldn't figure out at all.

When he first worked as a diver, he had once indulged in the pleasure of peering into humanity's intimate desires.

Such murky, ugly, and even grotesque desires.

But after performing Dive over 800 times, no human mind feels new anymore.

In such a situation, Woorin was material that could show him a new world he had never experienced before.

If he could dive one last time before dying, that target would be Woorin, not Ataraxia.

"Let me tell you the exact progress first. Currently, Shirone's Ataraxia cannot be extracted. That's because it's encapsulated. But if you wish, I could remove Ataraxia entirely and give it to you, Prince."

"Give it to me? Ataraxia?"

"Yes. You would possess the archangel's ability."

Zion swallowed his saliva. At this moment, his face was the spitting image of Orcamp.

No, anyone who had confirmed Ataraxia's power would have the same reaction.

But it didn't apply to Woorin, who immediately caught the error in his words.

"You just said extraction was impossible, didn't you?"

"If we're talking about normal methods, that's right. Ataraxia is presumed to be dwelling in the deep sea of Shirone's consciousness. In other words, it's too deep. The deeper one dives into the depths of the psyche, the stronger the ego's resistance becomes. At the level of the deep sea, you'd be buried the moment you enter."

Zion sheathed Armand and asked.

"Then how do you grave rob it?"

"There is one method."

Arius was planning to make the same proposal he had made to Orcamp.

But unlike before, he took his time.

If he could turn the situation around, now was the last chance. The moment he brought up this proposal, he would be completely at odds with Orcamp. Also, he would have to leave Kasula as soon as the job was finished.

"Speak! How can I possess Ataraxia?"

As Zion pressed him, Arius spoke in a cold voice.

"Extract Shirone's brain."

Not only Zion but even Woorin showed surprised expressions.

"Extract... his brain?"

"To be precise, collapse Shirone's unconscious. Consciousness is governed by the brain, but the unconscious is connected to the body. Therefore, if you separate the brain from the body, even if you go deep into consciousness, the ego's resistance becomes significantly weaker. Of course, there's no need to open the skull. Just having everything above the neck would be enough."

Arius made a gesture of slitting his throat with his thumb.

Zion nodded as if he understood.

"In other words, kill Shirone."

"Well, I don't like inductive thinking. A severed neck doesn't necessarily mean death, does it? I'm not saying we should kill Shirone, I'm just telling you a method to safely penetrate the unconscious."

Zion was dumbfounded. Surely this wasn't a remark made under the pretense that it was unrelated to assassinating a First Prince candidate.

"A severed neck doesn't mean death? You're completely insane."

Arius smiled as if he had received a compliment.

"Living as a grave robber, I've learned that there's no one in this world who isn't insane."

Zion refused to engage with the crazy talk and got to the point.

"Can you extract Ataraxia if I bring you Shirone's head?"

"If you ask whether it's possible, it's possible. However, too much time can't pass. I have to enter at the same time as the neck is severed. 'Just in case' death occurs, the mind would disappear as well."

"That quickly? If the neck is severed, life would only be sustained for about 10 seconds at most."

"Time flows slowly in the unconscious. The door has already been installed, so I'll enter as soon as Shirone's neck is cut. I'll dive to the first level there. Then I'll grave rob the real Ataraxia. Then it will become yours, Prince."

Zion puffed out his cheeks and exhaled "Whew!" before pacing around the gallery.

Even so, outright assassination? Wasn't this too hasty?

No, this was right. As time passed, the number of neutral faction members siding with Orcamp would increase. If he had to act before the paternity test results came out, today was indeed the perfect opportunity.

Arius read the murderous intent rising in Zion's eyes and smiled with satisfaction. He was certainly more king-like than Orcamp.

As if he had already heard the answer, Arius asked.

"So, how much will you pay?"

Zion also answered by not objecting.

Now the negotiation table was set. After thinking carefully, he presented a reasonable bid.

"2.7 billion gold."

Arius asked back with a slightly reluctant expression.

"Hmm, wasn't Armand's transaction price 30 billion gold?"

"So what? Are you saying that bastard's magic is worth more than my magic sword?"

Zion's estimate of 2.7 billion had come from that calculation.
