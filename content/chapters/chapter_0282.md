"Well, I'm just a seller, after all. Since you've seen the demonstration yourself, shouldn't the buyer be the one making the offer?"

Zion bit his lip.

No matter how much he denied it, reality was clear. Ataraxia was worth far more than Armand. No, beyond value—he wanted it by any means necessary.

"4 billion. Almost all of my wealth. That should be enough, right?"

"Hmm, 4 billion."

4 billion was enough money to build about four magic schools at current market rates. But Arius wasn't satisfied.

Honestly, no amount would have made a difference.

He had sold Magic Sword Armand for 3 billion, but if he had put it up for auction at Curia, it would have received at least an S-grade rating and could have commanded a blank check.

The reason he couldn't auction it was because it was stolen goods.

Of course, most Objets were stolen, but putting something he had personally stolen up for auction would leave traces that pursuers could follow.

Since money wasn't particularly important to Arius anyway, selling it safely to Zion was the most profitable approach.

When Arius showed signs of dissatisfaction even with 4 billion, Zion grew anxious. Desire grows stronger for things that can't be easily obtained.

But even if he scraped together all his funds, he could only add about 700 million to the current amount.

Woorin probably had ten times 4.7 billion, but wasting his one opportunity to ask for her help on money would be foolish.

Since Arius wasn't the type to be obsessed with material things anyway, Zion decided to play his final card.

"On top of that, I'll get you into Theraze's line."

As expected, Arius's eyes sparkled.

Theraze, the Emperor of Kashan, was one of the Three Emperors with the most powerful force on the continent. If he could receive her protection, he would no longer need to live as a fugitive.

But Zion didn't have the authority to make personnel recommendations. The only gateway to enter Theraze's line was through Woorin.

Zion glanced sideways at his sister's expression and asked.

"Woorin, you can arrange that, right?"

It was the first favor he had ever asked in his life, but he was certain it would be the last. With Ataraxia alone, he could achieve anything through his own power.

Just once, just this once.

"Then Brother Shirone dies?"

"Probably so. Though having your head cut off doesn't guarantee death."

Knowing that his sister had feelings for Shirone, Zion ended up saying the same crazy thing Arius had said. But it was a decent bit of wordplay to dodge the question.

"Hmm."

Woorin placed her finger on her lips and looked up at the ceiling.

She had no desire to get involved in Kasula's politics, but lately she felt sorry watching Zion struggle, and his incompetence was also pitiful. Since this seemed like it would be his last chance anyway, it wouldn't hurt to show some mercy.

"Alright, fine. I'll talk to mom for you."

Zion let out a sigh of relief.

It was ironic to feel anxious about something family should naturally do for each other, but since permission had been granted, it didn't matter anymore.

"There, the deal is done. 4 billion, plus the Theraze line. Cut off Shirone's head tonight and bring me Ataraxia."

Arius blinked and raised his hand.

"Wait a moment. Are you telling me to do that job?"

"What are you talking about? If the grave robber doesn't do it, who will?"

"Well, you see, you might not know this, Your Highness, but this is a specialized profession. I'm an expert in grave robbing, not combat. I especially dislike seeing blood."

Zion stared at him in disbelief.

No matter how many non-combat mages there were in the world, they at least had enough fighting ability to handle dangerous situations.

How could someone who had just been raving about extracting brains now say he disliked seeing blood?

"How can you not know how to fight? You could at least beat Shirone, couldn't you?"

"It's not a matter of winning or losing. Even though I get cursed at from all corners of the world, I'm still an authority on psychoanalysis. I was once counted among the world's top 100 intellectuals. Can you imagine me holding a sword and cutting off the head of an eighteen-year-old boy?"

"Then what do you want me to do? Go and kill him myself?"

"If you could, that would be best."

When Arius raised his hands in a gesture of passing the buck, Zion gritted his teeth. But he couldn't force someone to do something they refused to do.

"Fine. I'll do it myself."

"Oh, as expected of Your Highness. How manly."

When Arius egged him on, Zion snorted. There were plenty of people who could secretly cut off an eighteen-year-old boy's head without looking outside.

"But I can't get blood on my own hands. I'll have to use a professional for this too. Xenoger."

With those words, Zion looked up at empty air.

His gaze, having caught something, slowly descended and fixed on a point beyond Arius's shoulder.

At the killing intent stroking the back of his neck, Arius showed a stiff smile.

"Hehe, this is getting scary to turn around."

As soon as Arius finished speaking, the killing intent vanished like a lie. Shortly after, a man hanging upside down descended before Arius's eyes.

A thin thread that clearly seemed to emerge from his buttocks connected him to the ceiling. He had his legs crossed as if sitting, and both hands were clasped at his lower abdomen in a circular form.

His face was gaunt, and his thin nose bent vertically downward from the bridge. His lips were so thin they were barely there. Most notably, his eyes weren't the usual oval shape but perfect circles, and even those were small.

"Did you call for me, Your Highness?"

Zion turned to introduce him to Arius.

"Say hello. This is Spatour Xenoger, my personal bodyguard. Xenoger, this is Arius."

Xenoger twisted the thread while hanging upside down to change direction. In that way, he nodded to Zion, then turned back to Arius.

"Of course I know him. I've seen him many times. Though this person is seeing me for the first time."

Arius smiled thinly.

He definitely hadn't seen Xenoger before. But Xenoger had probably been watching him every time he came to the gallery.

"Wow, impressive skills. Where were you hiding?"

Xenoger answered with a face as emotionless as a corpse.

"Hiding? I've been behind you the whole time."

"Come on, you're joking..."

Arius's beady eyes narrowed further.

Maybe it was true. Without eyes in the back of his head, the world behind him might as well not exist.

But since tracking down the mastermind of the Seven Deadly Sins wasn't easy, it would be better for his mental health to think of it as a joke.

"Do you think I'm lying?"

As Xenoger said this, flesh bulged from both his cheekbones and temples. Then, tearing through the skin, six additional eyes emerged—three on each side.

They had no pupils and glowed purple like grape berries.

Eight eyes total. His blind spot was probably at most 15 degrees.

'A mimicry ability user...'

As Arius suspected, Xenoger was a master of spider mimicry, a type of Schema martial art.

Mimicry meant rapidly transforming cellular traits through Schema to create organs completely different from humans.

But to cause extreme mutations like Xenoger required the addition of genetic power.

The Spatour clan, who had protected the Theraze family's safety for generations, had been transforming their bodies with spider traits for nearly a thousand years. This was passed down through genetics, allowing them to achieve perfect spider mimicry abilities.

Arius turned his gaze from Xenoger to examine Woorin.

Theraze's children always had personal bodyguards assigned to them. Therefore, Woorin's bodyguard must also be present.

Arius looked as widely as his range of vision allowed. But no matter where he observed, he couldn't see any assassin.

Perhaps... they might be standing behind him.

The thought made him feel a bit chilled.

Using Spirit Zone in front of royalty could cause misunderstandings, so he was restraining himself, but even if he searched with synesthesia, there was a high chance he wouldn't detect them.

Skilled assassins possessed unique techniques that made them undetectable to Spirit Zone.

'Hehe, this is why I can't give up this lifestyle.'

When the strange introductions ended, Zion returned to the main topic.

"Now shall we plan the operation? Xenoger will handle killing Shirone—or rather, separating his brain from his body. Once the head is cut off, you can go in and extract Ataraxia."

Arius had no complaints now.

"Of course. Mobility is sufficient. But the second thing to consider is secrecy. No one besides the people gathered in this room should know about this operation."

Zion immediately understood and asked Xenoger.

"Can you do it without anyone knowing?"

"That's no problem. When you're tailing someone, there's always a moment when they'll be alone. Even if that doesn't happen, we could just kill everyone present."

"That could certainly be one method. But I'd prefer to minimize variables."

Arius said.

"The tricky part is the two women. Reina can be distracted since she has work to do, but the woman named Amy will stick close to Shirone. She's also a daughter of the Karmis family. If we let her roam freely, she might cause complications."

Hearing Arius's words, Xenoger's face sprouted eight eyeballs again.

Having activated his mimicry ability, he was a perfect spider. Even though he existed right before their eyes, his presence felt faint.

"Mistakes do not exist for me."

Arius pushed forward with both hands in a calming gesture.

"Whoa, whoa, I'm not doubting your skills. I'm just considering hypotheticals."

Zion, who had been lost in thought with his chin propped up, made his decision.

"Fine, then while you two handle the job, I'll keep Amy occupied. Killing only takes five minutes, right? So I just need to hold her for about an hour, plenty of time?"

"Oho, so that's your taste."

Zion didn't deny it.

"Well... she's pretty, isn't she? If it's just playing around for one night, it could be my taste."

Arius felt bitter at the words coming from the boy's mouth. Then again, having been born and raised in the royal palace, his experiences would be far more intense than those of typical adolescents.

In any case, he wasn't interested in royal scandals. Grave robbing an archangel's ability—only that excited him.

"Then let's decide on the location and time."

While the three plotted meticulously, Woorin spent her time bored and excluded in one corner.

She petted the cat, and it meowed. She smiled with her eyes and meowed back in response.

@

The royal castle was in a festive mood.

Since Shirone, a First Prince candidate, had displayed tremendous prowess, the subjects were forced to glisten with tears and be moved to emotion.

A grand party was held, and even after sunset, the Grand Hall was bright as day.

Long tables were set up along the hall's perimeter, laden with delicacies from land and sea. Amidst the court musicians' performances echoing throughout, nobles and noble ladies engaged in conversation.

Nobles who had gravitated toward foods to their taste came to greet Shirone.

"The demonstration was excellent. Truly a wonderful verification. The test results aren't out yet, but seeing your martial skills, you're clearly of His Majesty's bloodline, heh heh heh."

When Shirone only listened, a perceptive noble picked up the conversation.

"How could there be any doubt? The reunion after 18 years, and everything else—it's all thanks to His Majesty's virtue reaching the heavens. Don't you think so too, Lord Shirone?"

Shirone didn't respond this time either.

He wouldn't be fooled anymore. The royal court's protocols and manners were just masks to hide true intentions. Remove those masks, and everyone wore the same cold expression as him.

'Are these people enemies or allies?'

It seemed royalty was destined to live their entire lives thinking such thoughts.

The loudest voice in the banquet hall belonged to Eliza.

Despite never having raised him, she praised him endlessly as if she knew everything about Shirone.
