Amy frowned even more than Shirone.

While showing off was also a virtue for royalty, she didn't seem to think that the more he did so, the more dangerous it became for Shirone.

Shirone was checking the faces of the nobles gathered in the banquet hall when his eyes met those of a large man across the room.

The man burst into hearty laughter and strode diagonally across the hall toward him.

"Good evening, Lord Shirone! My apologies for the late greeting. There was some lamb stew over there that I'm quite fond of, you see. Oh, my apologies again for the delayed introduction. I'm Ritney Walker, Captain of the Royal Guard. I'm the chief officer responsible for security within the royal castle."

Shirone smiled for the first time.

Since he was in charge of security, he was someone connected to his parents' safety, so it wouldn't hurt to make a good impression. Besides, his straightforward attitude, unlike typical nobles, was refreshing.

"Hello. It's a pleasure to meet you."

"Ha ha! Indeed it is! There's absolutely nothing good about meeting the security chief too often!"

He was a reliable person. Though his face bore the harsh winds of sixty years, his body was larger and appeared more solid than anyone else's in the banquet hall.

When Walker extended his hand for a handshake, Shirone clasped it.

At that moment, Walker's eyes flashed, and waves of light surged into Shirone's mind.

For an instant, Shirone felt as if his thoughts had stopped.

This was a completely different level of dominance than any eye technique he had experienced before.

But as a mage who had reached the Diamond Body realm, he didn't easily surrender control.

Walker tilted his head with a puzzled expression, then smiled as if he had realized something and released his eye technique.

Shirone swallowed his rough breathing and looked at Walker. His thoughts had been scattered and he had no memory of it, but it hadn't felt particularly hostile.

"Truly impressive. To withstand Clear."

"Clear? Is that an eye technique?"

"That's right. It's a technique that injects madness into the opponent. Prolonged exposure causes loss of consciousness. But it doesn't work on you, Lord Shirone."

Shirone narrowed his eyes.

"Are you saying you were trying to knock me unconscious?"

"Ha ha! Of course not. I'm saying that madness is just that powerful a force. It's so powerful that when caught by Clear, you become unable to think at all. Thanks to that, it cleanly wipes away even mental-type magic. It's like using hydrochloric acid to remove stains that soap can't clean."

Madness was the purest mental state humans could reach. Therefore, any thought would inevitably be swept away before madness.

"As the one responsible for castle security, I had a duty to check whether Lord Shirone had been brainwashed. I apologize if you found it rude."

Shirone understood Walker's position.

This wasn't a battlefield but the inner sanctum of the kingdom. A security chief would need to worry about more than just visible threats.

"It's fine. If someone were brainwashed, they wouldn't know it themselves, right? Having it confirmed like this puts my mind at ease. It feels like getting a vaccination."

Walker scratched his head sheepishly.

"Actually, it didn't fully penetrate. But if you can withstand my Clear technique, which I've refined for decades, no one will be able to brainwash Lord Shirone. Still, if you were brainwashed despite that... what could we do? It would be unavoidable."

Shirone wondered whether he should laugh at this point. For a security chief, it seemed quite irresponsible.

Then Walker winked and added:

"The royal castle is a difficult place to understand. It's like dozens of family members with different surnames living in one house. Always protect yourself."

Shirone belatedly understood the meaning and nodded.

"Yes. I'll keep that in mind. It was nice meeting you."

Walker burst into hearty laughter and crossed the hall once again. Watching him heap lamb stew onto his plate reminded Shirone of Rian, bringing an involuntary smile to his lips.

The meeting between Shirone and Walker was an event that drew the attention of many nobles. And Zion was also one of those who witnessed the scene.

After confirming that Walker had left, Zion went behind Arius and pretended to select food while speaking to him.

"Will it be okay? It looked like Walker just attempted Clear."

Arius had been thinking about that too.

This morning in the waiting room, he had installed a door in Shirone's mind. If Clear had properly penetrated, it might have affected it.

"Clear is certainly the natural enemy of mental magic."

"What, so it failed?"

Arius smiled leisurely.

"Usually, that would be the case. But a door is different from brainwashing or hypnosis. There's no need to interfere with the depths of consciousness. I installed it at the 11th level in anticipation of this kind of situation."

"Are you certain? What if it was broken?"

"That won't happen. If Clear had penetrated to the surface level, Shirone would have lost consciousness. Causing the First Prince Candidate to faint in a banquet hall full of nobles would create a major incident."

The 11th level of human consciousness was where others' thoughts rushed in chaotically, so even with Shirone's pure mind, finding the door would be like looking for a needle on a beach.

Still, when Walker attempted Clear, it had given him chills. While it was probably just the security chief's hasty verification, all layers below the 9th level would have been swept away.

'He couldn't really have thought Shirone was brainwashed. What exactly is he suspicious of?'

Ritney Walker.

The royal castle's security chief and swordsmanship theorist who wrote "Kasula Court Swordsmanship (Beginner)," he was a skilled individual who had won the regional swordsmanship championship at eighteen and been recruited to the castle, rising through the ranks ever since.

Being security chief wasn't a position you could fill with strength alone. You had to understand the ins and outs of politics.

Attempting Clear immediately after the Ataraxia demonstration was proof that he anticipated the existence of flies clinging to the archangel's power.

'Then I'm probably within his range of suspicion too. Though of course, I'm no mere fly.'

Zion asked:

"So what now? Walker seems suspicious. You're not going to give him something to catch you with later, are you?"

"Nothing to worry about. Walker isn't an expert in mental magic, and Clear is just a simple principle with broad application. You know what they say—there's no good medicine among cure-alls. If I wanted to, I could easily work around it. Let's proceed as planned."

"I see. Understood."

Zion filled his plate with food and moved away from Arius.

After parting with Walker, the nobles didn't approach Shirone to talk. There was nothing good about attracting the security chief's attention.

Seeing Shirone standing alone, Amy perceptively approached to keep him company.

"Shirone."

"Yeah. How's the party? Fun?"

Amy shrugged.

"So-so."

"Me too, so-so. But what have you been doing all this time?"

Amy pointed to her own eyes.

"Watching with Red Eyes."

"Watching? What?"

"How many times people glance at you."

Shirone's mouth fell open in bewilderment.

Of course, with self-image memory, it wasn't impossible, just difficult. But was such tedious work really necessary?

"What kind of information could you get from that?"

Amy pursed her lips.

"I don't know. I had nothing else to do, so I just tried it. But as expected, there wasn't much of note. You're the star of the party, so it's natural for people to glance at you."

"Ha ha! Right. You're not saying you just figured that out now, are you?"

Shirone threw out the joke, but Amy didn't laugh.

"But... I discovered something unusual. If I checked correctly, there's a group that hasn't looked at you even once since the party started."

Amy pointed across the room with her chin as if telling him to check for himself. Where his gaze turned, mages from the Magic Department were gathered.

At that moment, a middle-aged mage standing at the center of the group looked back at Shirone. His gaze felt like it was carving into his mind, making his body freeze.

"That's Magic Department Head Aimar Bosun."

"That person..."

A Red Line certified 4th-rank mage.

He was said to be a talented individual skilled in many areas, able to handle any element, and supervising the overall food production of the Kingdom of Kasula.

Since Kasula's magical power was weak compared to other countries, there were no certified 1st-rank mages except for the Association President. The Magic Department Head was a position that would be filled by a 3rd-rank Great Magician in Tormia.

But even so, he wasn't someone Shirone could dare evaluate.

Bosun stared at Shirone for a long time as if relieving his pent-up frustration. Then he chuckled and approached, carrying a bowl of food from the table.

"Good evening. I am Aimar Bosun."

Shirone and Amy bowed their heads in greeting.

Regardless of political leanings, a Red Line 4th-rank was like a senior from heaven. Of course, Shirone ranked higher in the castle hierarchy, but showing respect to a senior was also pride as a mage.

"Impressive, this power of an archangel. It will become a great strength for the Kingdom of Kasula. Provided, of course, that Lord Shirone becomes the First Prince."

Shirone remained silent, tense.

Even though it was the same provocation, it felt different from Zion's. Every word felt like a blade stabbing into his mind.

Bosun offered the food he had brought from the opposite table.

"Would you care for some?"

"No, I..."

Shirone's face turned pale as he confirmed the food.

It was Fresh Truffle, chocolates dusted with cocoa powder—the same type as the dessert laced with lethal poison that had appeared at his family's meal.

Killing intent rose in Shirone's heart. Could Bosun be attempting assassination?

No, that wasn't important. If he wasn't the culprit, he was even more vicious.

Watching Shirone's expression, Bosun tilted his head and asked:

"Hmm? What's wrong? Don't you like chocolate? It's really delicious."

Shirone wanted to smash Bosun's jaw as he chewed the chocolate. He was agitated enough to have such violent thoughts.

Yet Bosun remained calm. That sight made Shirone even more furious.

"You...!"

Just as the sound was about to burst out involuntarily, Amy grabbed his hand.

It was a trap. Anyone among the castle's nobility would know that Fresh Truffle contained poison. Bosun simply wanted to get on Shirone's nerves.

Shirone also came to his senses and calmed his anger.

When his calculated provocation didn't work, Bosun predictably lost interest and put away his plate.

"It was a pleasant meeting. Well then, I'll take my leave."

As Bosun left, the mages who hadn't even glanced over until now sneered at Shirone.

Every single one was a mage who couldn't be treated carelessly. Shirone realized anew where he had come.

"Shirone, are you okay? That bastard deliberately provoked you. You did well to endure it."

"Really. What a thoroughly nasty person."

Though the night was deep, the banquet wasn't over.

The nobles, perhaps intoxicated, danced the traditional Kasula social dances to the court musician's performance. And now was precisely the time for Shirone's group to act.

With alcohol flowing and conversations with ladies, any kind of talk was bound to slip out. The plan was to eavesdrop on this with Reina's powerful hearing.

According to the original plan, Shirone and Reina should be entering the ballroom by now. But when Amy looked, Reina was standing in a corner, just watching nervously.

She seemed dejected from the day's events.

'Was she always that kind of personality? She's different from how she appears on the surface.'

While thinking she was a kind person and not disliking it, one corner of her heart felt heavy.

Anyway, work had to be done, so she sighed and went to Reina. Then she subtly pushed her back, sending her toward Shirone.

Reina also walked toward Shirone as if she couldn't help it. But even there, she hesitated for a long time.

Shirone smiled and extended his hand. He had been bothered by getting angry during the day anyway.

"Shall we begin?"

When Shirone treated her comfortably, Reina also regained her playfulness.

"After learning through so much nagging, wouldn't it be disappointing not to use it?"

Reina followed Shirone's lead as they moved around the ballroom. Countless couples danced the same dance, passing by their sides.

Musicians can hear the discordant parts of specific notes even among dozens of instruments playing. For Reina, human voices were like instruments, so vast amounts of information were collected.

Talk about needing to reserve summer vacation villas from now. Talk about needing to change the bank for creating slush funds. Promises for secret meetings, saying they should meet in rooms since security was tight.

If something big was ahead, it would inevitably show up in conversations somehow. But based on the information received so far, no special atmosphere could be detected.
