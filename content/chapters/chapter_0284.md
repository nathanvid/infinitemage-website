"It looks like today will pass quietly. Still, we can't let our guard down."

Shirone responded with a smile.

She wasn't going through all this trouble just to gather high-level information. He was grateful for Reina's efforts to reassure him.

"I'm sorry about earlier today. I think my nerves are on edge."

"Hehe, it's fine. Don't worry too much. I'll do my best to protect you. By the way, relax a bit. If you stay so tense, you might trip."

When Shirone relaxed his body, the two of them performed a dance as beautiful as flowing water.

They were the most beautiful couple in the ballroom.

"Hoho! What a perfectly matched pair. How can Shirone be so beautiful? It must be thanks to inheriting His Majesty's bloodline."

"And what about her partner? I hear she's a very famous musician in the Kingdom of Tormia. She has such a lovely demeanor - just looking at her brightens one's mood."

Amy stood alongside the noble ladies engaged in conversation. Even in her eyes, they clearly stood out from the other couples.

'Why are they taking so long?'

Checking the time, Amy realized things were taking much longer than originally planned. She was wondering if they had obtained new information when someone approached.

Amy was startled to see Zion and quickly showed proper respect.

"Greetings, Your Highness."

"Yes, are you enjoying the ball?"

"Yes. Everything is to my liking."

Zion smiled with satisfaction. After dealing with Shirone, who treated royalty so casually, facing Amy who was flustered made him finally feel like a prince.

"How about it? May I request a dance for a moment?"

Amy looked at the hand Zion extended.

According to protocol, to refuse a partner request, one needed to have another partner.

But since Shirone was dancing with Reina, she had no grounds for refusal. He had definitely approached her with this in mind.

"Yes. It would be an honor."

Amy took Zion's hand and entered the ballroom.

Though it was her first time with traditional Kasula dance, with her exceptional dancing skills and Insight ability, she could easily match Zion's rhythm.

The nobles' attention now shifted to Zion and Amy.

Praise poured forth, no less than for the Shirone and Reina couple. Lovely. Beautiful. Noble. And so on.

Amy's face burned. Was this what it felt like to be a princess?

But that was the extent of her excitement.

She had never once thought about wanting to be a princess. Though she thought daily about becoming the world's greatest magician.

'Surprisingly innocent. This is unexpected.'

Seeing Amy's shyness, Zion thought he had already passed the halfway point. From his experience spreading rumors with noble ladies since age twelve, he knew what words worked in situations like this.

"Beautiful."

Amy felt like she was under attack.

Was this brat in his right mind? She wanted to scream from embarrassment.

But given the setting, she couldn't show it.

As she continued dancing while inwardly seething with emotion, her gaze collided head-on with Shirone approaching from the opposite direction.

It was truly an instant.

Shirone looked surprised. Even in that brief moment, she could sense him asking something with his eyes.

Amy hastily looked away.

She didn't know why she did that. She just seemed afraid to meet Shirone's eyes.

She realized later that she shouldn't have done that, but by then the distance had already grown.

As her head became complicated and her steps began to tangle, Zion smiled. He probably thought she was nervous being in his arms.

"Relax. As long as you're with me, no one will look down on you."

Zion liked Amy. She felt different from the frivolous nobles from the start. Thinking she was lovely, he pulled her waist close, and at that moment Amy's dancing came to an abrupt stop.

Her body reacted before she could think. Naturally, the nobles' attention focused on them.

Amy's face reddened as she lost her composure, then quickly thought of one solution.

"Ah, I'm a bit tired. It was enjoyable."

As she showed courtesy and turned away as if she had planned to stop from the beginning, a venomous look flashed in Zion's eyes. Immediately pulling Amy's wrist, Zion whispered in a low voice.

"I've taken custody of Vincent and Olina."

Amy's shocked eyes quickly swept the crowd. She was trying to locate Shirone.

Zion threatened with a menacing tone.

"That's not good. Don't tell anyone and follow me quietly. Then I'll release Shirone's parents safely."

Amy turned her gaze back and acted with a calm expression. The biggest problem was that she couldn't gauge whether it was true.

Reina's attendants were supposed to report the situation at one-hour intervals, and the last report had come in 32 minutes ago.

Would it be difficult to carry out such a task within those 32 minutes? Or would it be enough time?

Amy followed Zion as if nothing had happened.

Whatever intention lay behind this scheme, she probably wasn't the main target.

In 28 minutes, Reina would move anyway. If she could just hold out until then, this crisis might become another opportunity.

'Of course, I need to survive first.'

When the two left hand in hand, the nobles finally dropped their suspicions. Young men and women getting heated and slipping out of the hall was a common enough sight.

Zion's insides were boiling as he led Amy away.

The strategy of using Shirone's parents was Plan B that Arius had proposed. Since he had boasted he could make any woman fall for him, his pride was more than a little wounded.

'Fine. I just need to get her out anyway. I've done my part, Arius.'

Without Amy, Shirone would be isolated. Reina had to manage the overall affairs of the royal castle, so she couldn't focus solely on Shirone. Even if she realized and moved belatedly, by then Shirone's head would already be rolling on the ground.

'Hehe, farewell, Shirone.'

@

Reina looked puzzled at Shirone, who had suddenly stopped dancing. He didn't even seem to realize he wasn't moving his legs.

"Shirone, what's wrong? What happened?"

"Oh, well... Amy went somewhere with Zion?"

Reina hurriedly looked around. As Shirone said, the two were nowhere to be seen.

From her investigation, Zion wasn't the type to chase after women. But like boys his age, he didn't dislike them either, so the number of women he'd spent nights with wasn't exactly small.

Simply thinking, he might have taken interest in Amy.

Amy was a beautiful girl who could make even royalty fall for her, and with Zion's personality, he wouldn't hesitate even if she was Shirone's friend.

The problem was Amy. What exactly had she heard to follow Zion?

Reina looked at Shirone. Though he was pretending to be calm, his gaze was fixed on the door.

She gave a bitter smile and pushed Shirone's back. If he was going to go regardless of who tried to stop him, it was better to send him first.

"Go ahead. You can go ask Amy directly, can't you?"

"Would that be alright?"

"What are you talking about? She's your friend. Go quickly. I'll handle things here."

"Then... I'll be back."

Shirone glanced around nervously before turning. But from then on, he left the Grand Hall without looking back.

Reina placed her hand on her hip and exhaled.

'Did I make things too difficult by getting in the middle? Sigh, how do I fix this personality?'

Anyway, now wasn't the time to dwell on emotions.

The reason she sent Shirone first was because the attendant was due to arrive soon. Amy was important, but she couldn't neglect watching over his parents either.

'Hm? Parents?'

The moment she thought that far, one possibility occurred to her.

Amy was definitely not a child who would fall for Zion's tricks. So what was her motive for following him without a word?

'Could it be?'

Reina stomped the floor hard.

This wasn't the time to wait for the attendant. No, if they had made a move, there was a greater chance the attendant wouldn't come at all. Checking the time, she ran toward the lodging where Vincent and Olina were staying.

**Theraze's Proposal (1)**

Shirone ran to the royal apartments.

Though he had followed Zion's trail as quickly as possible, they had already disappeared. For now, he planned to check Zion's room.

'Why did she follow Zion?'

There must be a reasonable explanation, but whatever it was, he didn't feel good about it. Strange emotions kept surging up, preventing his thoughts from connecting as quickly as usual.

Arriving at Zion's room, Shirone hesitated involuntarily just as he was about to turn the door handle.

Bad thoughts came to him. The image of Amy dancing with Zion surfaced.

Why had she looked away? If there was a special reason, she should have sent a signal. The Amy he knew was that kind of person.

'Am I... doing something unnecessary?'

What if it wasn't what he was thinking? And what if it was what he was thinking?

Shirone shook his head frantically.

Amy wasn't someone who would act recklessly before something important. Such thoughts were actually insulting to her.

Shirone steeled his resolve and opened the door.

The brightly lit room showed no signs of people. But there was someone there. He could see Woorin moving toward the table.

"Woorin? Why are you here...?"

Woorin leisurely sat in a chair. From the way she petted the cat on her lap, she seemed unaware of who had entered.

But now Shirone realized that visible actions weren't what mattered.

"Woorin. Where is Zion right now...?"

"Sit down."

Woorin interrupted and offered him a seat. Her voice carried an unusual dignity.

Shirone swallowed hard and sat across from her.

"Why are you in Zion's room? I didn't see you at the ball."

"I thought my brother would come. So I waited."

It was as Shirone had expected. She knew what was happening in the royal castle right now.

"Where is Zion?"

"Well. He's somewhere, I suppose."

Woorin looked around elsewhere as if uninterested.

Shirone felt frustrated. But he didn't make the foolish mistake of pressing her.

He had already revealed all his intentions at the demonstration hall. All that remained was her choice.

As the silence lengthened, Woorin spoke first.

"Why did you do it?"

Shirone focused his eyes and glared at her.

Claiming not to know wouldn't make sense. So this question wasn't the core issue either.

"Why did you unleash all your power? That was tantamount to a declaration of war against the Theraze faction. Brother Zion was very angry because of it."

"If I had done it half-heartedly, you wouldn't have helped me."

Woorin made a puzzled expression, but Shirone wasn't fooled by the mask. That too was something Woorin had taught him.

"You're different from Zion. You're the Empress's successor. The political situation in Kasula is just a small part for you, who dreams of becoming Emperor."

"Is that so? Well, everyone wants to cling to my power. Brother Shirone is the same."

"That might be true. But Ataraxia must have a different meaning for you too, right?"

Interest appeared in Woorin's eyes for the first time.

"What's different about it?"

"The Emperor of the Kashan Empire is the leader of the Valkyries. And Ataraxia is the ability of the archangel, considered the highest among the Valkyries. If that's the case, it would have sufficient value for you to use as well."

Woorin nodded readily. If Shirone's Ataraxia hadn't been as impressive as today, there would indeed be no reason whatsoever to help him.

"That's right. Seeing my brother's ability made me think differently. Ataraxia would be a great help in my becoming Emperor."

"So help me. If you want, after I graduate from magic school, I'll become your ally. So please don't touch my family and friends."

Woorin burst into laughter.

"You're a bit naive."

"What?"

"How many Great Magicians do you think submit their resumes to me each year? If you thought I'd cling to just one Ataraxia, you're mistaken. I'm not dismissing my brother's talent, but you're still just a student."
