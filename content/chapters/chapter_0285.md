"So you cannot accept me?"

Woorin scratched her cheek with an apologetic expression.

"I would like to help you, but there are daughters of Theraze who are my competitors in countless kingdoms. Especially since I'm young, I don't want to stand out yet. Kasula isn't exactly a good foundation either. There's no need to make myself a target of my sisters by acting prematurely, right?"

Shirone felt bitter despite himself. Fourteen years old. That was the age of the girl sitting before him.

'You really are incredible, Woorin.'

He also realized anew how foolish his behavior from a few days ago had been.

Even now that he understood the true nature of the royal castle, it was chilling—what kind of nerve had he had to think he could deal with a woman like this before?

"Fine. If there's no room for negotiation, I'll leave. I need to find Amy."

Shirone stood up as if he had heard enough.

If his assumption was wrong, everything would flow toward the worst possible outcome, but it couldn't be helped.

Because there are no fools in the royal castle who miss the moment when they must act, no matter how great the danger.

"I wish you luck."

The moment he heard Woorin's farewell, his heart sank with a thud. But he didn't show it and walked toward the door.

He must not show hesitation or fear. He had to truly give up everything and leave this room.

'Ataraxia isn't needed. Is that really so?'

Perhaps it wasn't that important to Woorin.

But if there was even the slightest benefit, no matter how trivial, people didn't like giving it to others.

Shirone walked, clinging to a small hope like a lifeline.

Even as he grasped the door handle and turned it, there was no reaction from Woorin.

As the door opened, his eyes squeezed shut.

This was the end of everything.

"But if..."

Shirone's steps came to an abrupt halt.

"If I make the maximum concession... that is, if we consider it an advance on your future..."

Shirone slowly turned around to look back at Woorin.

"You might be able to earn the opportunity to negotiate with me, a daughter of Theraze."

"The opportunity to negotiate?"

Even mortgaging Ataraxia would only get him a seat at the negotiating table at best? And that was an opportunity that required advancing his own future.

"Yes. Negotiation. I can't just help you for nothing. As I said before, I don't want to put myself in a dangerous position. There's one condition. It's not particularly difficult, but if you agree to this condition, I'll become your ally."

Shirone raised his chin as if to say, let's hear it.

"Tonight, spend the night with me."

"What, what?"

For a condition presented at the end of an intense psychological battle, it was absurd. What business did he have spending the night with her?

As if reading Shirone's thoughts, Woorin added:

"Don't worry. I don't mean it that way. I just mean stay with me tonight. Though... if other thoughts occur to you, you're welcome to try."

Shirone's expression crumpled.

"What on earth are you talking about? You're my half-sister."

"That's something we'll only know after the paternity test is finished. And frankly, it's not important anyway. Same-sex marriage is common among royalty when entire kingdoms come as dowries."

Shirone couldn't understand. It felt like solving difficult exam problems in sequence only to encounter a nonsense quiz at the end.

"Why? What does that condition have to do with helping me?"

Woorin exhaled with a reluctant "hmm" and told her story for the first time.

"Women of the Theraze family have traditionally ascended to the imperial throne. This might sound harsh, but to us, men are merely tools to be consumed according to their usefulness. Therefore, daughters of Theraze do not keep men who have other women in their hearts nearby. If you're going to Amy, that means I cannot accept you either."

Shirone understood. For a woman of the Theraze family, such an iron rule wasn't strange.

But Woorin was mistaken. Amy was his dearest friend in the world.

"I understand what you mean. But I don't carry Amy in my heart."

The corners of Woorin's mouth curved up slightly.

"Zion seems to be interested in her."

Something hot surged up from Shirone's chest.

"Of course, if she rejects him, nothing will happen. Despite appearances, he's a man with strong self-respect who doesn't treat women coercively when they refuse him."

If what Woorin said was true, it was fortunate. But the fire that had already attached itself to his heart showed no signs of being extinguished.

Woorin clapped her palms together.

"Well then, let's do this. I simply want to confirm your feelings. From this moment, I'll guarantee everyone's safety, including Amy's. I can send people and give orders right now. But only if you stay with me tonight."

He didn't know what kind of threats had made Amy follow Zion, but if he accepted Woorin's proposal, she could escape safely. Moreover, his family's and Reina's safety would be guaranteed. There was no reason not to accept.

"Zion... where did he take Amy?"

"I can't reveal that yet, not before you make your decision. It's very simple. You just need to trust me. Show me that I take priority over that woman."

Trembling that started from his fingertips spread throughout his body. Everything was turning in his favor, but he couldn't make the decision.

Because he couldn't verify it.

Were humans truly such beings bound by their five senses? What exactly should he believe to follow her words?

There was no evidence that Woorin wasn't helping Zion. If by any chance Woorin was lying, Amy would be in tremendous danger.

"Why are you hesitating? I am Theraze Woorin. I don't lie, and isn't this proposal what you wanted? If you just prove you don't carry another woman in your heart, I'll promote you. I won't spare any support in developing your abilities, and when I become emperor later, you too can become the world's greatest magician."

It was a dream-like story for Shirone. And she had the ability to turn that dream into reality.

Even Great Magicians were writing resumes wanting to serve under Woorin. Such a tremendous opportunity lay before him.

Lost in thought, Shirone finally made his decision.

"I'm going to Amy. I won't accept your proposal."

Woorin sighed as if frustrated.

"You're throwing away an incredible opportunity to form ties with Theraze? No, more than anything, you can protect the family you hold so dear. And yet you're going to let it all go to waste because of one woman?"

"That's right. That's what I intend to do."

Woorin closed her mouth as if shocked. But neither resignation nor regret could be found on Shirone's face.

"But Woorin, that's everything to humans. Only what they see and feel is the real world. Even if you truly would save Amy, if I can't verify it, it's just a world that doesn't exist. I cannot leave Amy in the face of visible danger for the sake of invisible safety. That's why I must go to Amy."

Sadness flickered through Woorin's eyes.

"You live such a difficult life. It would be easy to just choose."

Shirone smiled bitterly. He often thought the same thing. But that was the very shackle of intelligence. Once you know, there's no way not to act.

"I know it was too great an opportunity. I know how far you, the imperial heir, compromised to help me. I'm not doubting you at all. But I have to go."

Woorin walked over to Shirone. She wrapped her arms around his waist and buried her face against him.

"You're such a fool. I'm sorry I couldn't do anything for you. Personally, I really liked you. I hope fortune blesses your future."

Then she stepped back a couple of paces and revealed the information Shirone had wanted to know.

"Go to the gallery. It's the only place where you can avoid people's attention. It's also where you go whenever you're seducing women."

Fire blazed in his heart once more. As Shirone finished preparing to leave, Woorin took something from her pocket.

"Wait. Take this."

Shirone caught the small object Woorin threw.

Opening his palm, he saw a bead emitting red light. From its color it seemed to be a ruby, but it lacked the cold texture characteristic of gemstones.

"This is...?"

"Payment for El Crouch's ceramic doll. It's easily worth over 100 million."

"No. I really gave you that gift..."

"Of course I know your sincerity. But reason and emotion are separate matters. Since negotiations have broken down, I can't be in debt to you either."

Having said that, Shirone had no choice but to accept it.

Personally, he felt fondness for her, but politically they were now strangers. It was better for both their futures to settle debts cleanly.

"Alright. I'll put it to good use after graduation."

Shirone put the bead in his pocket and walked toward the door.

Then he suddenly stopped and looked back at Woorin. When he thought about it, she had truly helped him so much.

At the dinner table, she had preserved his parents' dignity and supported his argument about attending magic school.

In the gallery, she had introduced him to the Objet, and in the Colosseum, she had given him advice that made him realize the true nature of the royal castle.

Now he even had escape funds from payment for the ceramic doll. In a situation where he was being pursued by the royal castle, 100 million gold would be tremendous help.

"Thank you. From the beginning until now. Now that I think about it, I wouldn't have lasted this far without you."

"Hehe, even in hell there's water to drink."

Woorin responded with a Kasula proverb.

It meant there was hope even in difficult situations, but thinking about it in reverse, it also meant that a glimmer of hope intensified suffering.

"Haha! That makes sense."

Realizing his situation, Shirone burst into hollow laughter and left Zion's room.

"Phew."

As the door closed, Woorin exhaled deeply. Then she clasped her hands behind her back—something she didn't usually do—and paced around the room.

"Arian Shirone..."

Stopping in her tracks, she quickly looked back at the door.

With a cool smile, her eyes were tinged with madness like a child facing the greatest toy of their life.

"You're really not ordinary, are you?"

Woorin burst into laughter, then energetically returned to her seat and plopped down in the chair. Crossing her legs and resting her chin on the table, she stared intently at the door Shirone had exited through.

Less than 10 percent of what Woorin had told Shirone moments ago was true.

Everything had been lies. She had no intention of promoting Shirone or guaranteeing Amy's safety.

It also wasn't true that Zion had strong self-respect.

Rather, he was someone who would eliminate any woman he targeted by any means necessary.

Therefore, if Shirone had stayed with her tonight, his life would have been completely ruined.

"Humans have no sense for trusting others. Isn't that right, Cleo?"

Meow.

Woorin's cat answered. It couldn't possibly understand human speech, but nothing would change anyway.

There was no way for humans to trust other humans.

But people turned away from this very simple truth simply because the thought wasn't beautiful.

Those who acknowledge truth and those who turn away from it.

She thought that from this small difference, all the rulers and the ruled of the world were divided.

Woorin leaned her head back over the chair and looked up at the ceiling with a faint smile.

"If you keep transcending yourself like that, you might reach it someday."

The cat didn't answer.
