'Hurry, hurry!'

Reina ran at full speed toward the Annex.

If Theraze's faction had made a move against Shirone's parents, the situation would become serious. Part of her felt guilty as well. She should have been more careful.

'No, this was the best choice. I strengthened all possible security...'

If that was the case, it meant the enemy had acted without considering the consequences. Perhaps all the escorts had been wiped out.

What puzzled her was why now?

Sending assassins on the first day had been perfectly timed.

But now their side had taken full precautions. There was no reason to employ such a high-risk, low-return strategy when getting caught would completely reverse their position.

Entering the annex building, Reina turned toward the quarters where Vincent was staying. At the same time, she bumped into an escort from the Ozent family at the corner.

"Gasp! Miss Reina!"

Reina pushed past the escort and ran to the room.

"Move aside! What's going on?"

Opening the door and entering, Vincent and Olina looked at her with puzzled expressions. There didn't seem to be any signs of commotion.

Vincent was in the middle of carving a piece of wood, while Olina sat beside him covered with a blanket, drinking cocoa.

"Lady Reina, what's the matter? You don't look well."

"Ah, well..."

Reina was at a loss for words at Vincent's question.

Both of them were safe. Then why had Amy followed Zion?

The escort who had returned to the room late asked with a flushed face.

"Miss, what on earth is happening? Why are you suddenly here?"

Reina hurriedly collected herself.

"Oh, that... I came on patrol to see how you were doing."

The escort breathed a sigh of relief.

"Phew, I thought something terrible had happened. I was just about to go make my report. Everything is fine here."

Olina asked with an anxious expression.

"Is something wrong? What about Shirone?"

As expected, a mother's intuition about her child was sharp. Reina swallowed nervously and hastily made up an excuse.

"He's still at the banquet hall. He's having a good time with Amy, so you don't need to worry."

At the mention of Amy, Olina seemed relieved. If something had happened to Shirone, she would surely have rushed here too.

"I see. Don't worry. We're doing fine."

"Hoho! Yes. Then rest comfortably. I'll be back soon."

Reina forced a smile, and as soon as she left the room, she immediately headed in the opposite direction.

Shirone's parents were safe. But Amy would have had no way to confirm that fact. That meant she had been threatened. But why Amy?

Reina stopped abruptly and spoke aloud.

"Shirone."

This was the worst-case scenario.

The reason she hadn't detected any particular danger at the banquet hall was due to the effect of the Ataraxia demonstration. It meant most of the Neutral Faction had become favorable toward Orcamp.

But that had caused Zion to draw his real sword. The reason he had separated Amy with lies that would be exposed soon could only be one thing.

He planned to finish everything tonight.

'I thought the atmosphere was good enough to let it slide, but Zion moved personally. That's why no intelligence came in.'

This wasn't the time to be standing around. Since the escort had just left Vincent's quarters, it had been over twenty minutes since Shirone and Amy had separated.

Reina activated Sound of Silence, a Schema ear technique. As her hearing was enhanced, all the sounds of the castle began to be collected, down to the smallest details.

It was too late to follow Shirone's trail now. Wherever high decibels could be heard, that would be the center of the incident.

Amy followed Zion into the underground gallery.

Whether the castle's underground was naturally quiet or Zion had made arrangements beforehand, not even an ant was moving around.

Come to think of it, since the banquet was going on late into the night, the servants who weren't on duty would be sleeping.

Amy thought this actually worked out well.

While Zion was royalty, his actual combat power was on par with nobles his age. With the elite magic training she'd received since childhood, depending on the opportunity, she could easily subdue him.

Therefore, this silent space was the best situation for her. She could beat up Zion without worrying about anyone watching.

'If possible, even killing him...'

Harming someone was uncomfortable, but as long as Shirone's parents were captured, such thoughts were mere luxury.

Zion entered the gallery's cave chamber with a gentlemanly smile. Seeing that the doors were installed in layers, Amy had the same thought as Shirone.

'I'll need to save at least two spells if I want to break down the doors and escape.'

But such thoughts disappeared when she saw the gallery's leisurely atmosphere.

It was a room where all sorts of items were collected.

She didn't know what they were used for, but at least they weren't good for torturing or harming someone.

Amy examined the northern display case, which contained the only things that could be used as weapons.

She couldn't tell how well-sharpened the blade was without being an expert, but one sword that caught her eye was radiating sharpness by itself.

"Where are Shirone's parents?"

Zion said with a mischievous smile.

"Parents? Well. Do I need to know such things?"

Amy's gaze turned cold.

"Did you deceive me?"

Zion checked the time. The next hour was the execution window. The reason they hadn't set a precise assassination time was because they had planned the strategy with a small number of people.

Some degree of fluid situations was inevitable, but it also had the advantage of being able to flexibly respond to variables.

'One hour...'

Suddenly he felt regretful. Amy was truly a fine woman. With such a beauty, wouldn't an hour feel like an instant?

Anyway, while he killed time here, Zenogger and Arius would finish the job. He just had to receive the Ataraxia that would roll his way.

"I'm sorry for lying. But I trust you'll understand. To seduce a beautiful woman, some white lies are necessary, aren't they?"

Amy didn't want to hear it. Since he had deceived her first, she thought she could be somewhat rude and snapped back.

"I'm leaving. I'll decline such requests in the future."

"Really? Can you still say that after seeing this?"

When Zion opened his fist, a necklace with a golden cross pendant came cascading down. Just from the precision of the craftsmanship, you could tell it was an expensive item.

But Amy snorted.

She didn't know how many women had fallen for such tricks, but the Carmis family was also a renowned house in the Kingdom of Tormia.

Even if he handed her a diamond, she was confident she wouldn't bat an eye.

"What are you doing now? Do you think you can win favor with just this?"

Zion approached with a sneer, as if he had expected this reaction.

"Just this? How about taking a closer look?"

Amy glanced at the pendant with disdain.

Since royalty wouldn't carry around an alloy, it must be pure gold, and from a rough estimate, it looked like the size that would require melting about 500 gold coins to extract.

There was a pearl embedded in the center, but unusually, it had a metallic, iron-colored sheen.

It was far from the beautiful luster of natural pearls.

The shape was perfect, but it definitely wasn't something a woman would wear for beauty.

'What is this? What's so special about...'

Amy suddenly realized.

She remembered reading about it in a book. A pearl with an iron-colored sheen. It was a pearl from the Celestial King Clam that lived in the deep sea of Alcantira.

According to geological surveys, the Alcantira Canyon had the deepest ocean in the world.

Not a ray of light penetrated it, and the water pressure was enormous, making it impossible for fishermen to harvest, accessible only through national projects involving magicians.

The durability of clams that withstood the deep-sea pressure was known to create chemical substances harder than diamonds.

In other words, it was one of the hardest materials in the world.

Moreover, since it was a perfect sphere, it had endless industrial applications.

Of course, there probably weren't many people who would pay money to buy such items, but according to what she had read, Celestial King Clam pearls could replace ball bearings in ancient weapons, so at minimum they were worth 200 million gold each.

Therefore, they were also used as currency in trade between kingdoms where transporting massive amounts of gold coins was impractical.

'So this is a Celestial King Clam pearl...'

The reason ancient weapons from before recorded history could still exist was presumed to be because they were made from the hard rock of Heaven.

But no matter how ancient the weapons were, the parts of their operating mechanisms would inevitably wear down. To replace those components, they needed at least the durability of Celestial King Clam pearls.

200 million gold for one ball bearing.

You could imagine how much budget kingdoms were pouring into maintaining the functionality of ancient weapons.

'Hah. This settles it.'

Zion assumed her silence meant she was conflicted.

Naturally, how could she not be? What he had offered wasn't just any jewel, but currency traded between nations.

"You have good breeding indeed. Most nobles make marriage vows with diamonds. Their hardness symbolizes love that will never break. But this is even harderâ€”a Celestial King Clam pearl. Only direct descendants among royalty can use it as a betrothal gift. How about it? Shall we promise our future with this?"

Zion prepared to put on the necklace with a greasy smile.

Of course, he wouldn't seduce just any woman with a Celestial King Clam pearl. Even if she were truly a wonderful woman, readily handing over 200 million gold would be insane.

But right now, he wouldn't mind giving away all the objets in this room, not just 200 million gold.

Because when Shirone died, Amy would be finished anyway.

"I fell for you at first sight. Will you accept my heart?"

Finally, Zion made his earnest confession. Amy stared at him blankly.

A prince of Theraze's bloodline and the First Prince of the Kingdom of Kasula proposing with a Celestial King Clam pearl was probably a scene countless noble ladies dreamed of. So Amy wondered if she herself was abnormal for feeling no particular emotion.

But she truly felt indifferent. The first thought that came to mind upon hearing Zion's confession was that she should return to Shirone now.

"I'm sorry. I'm grateful that Your Highness looks upon me favorably, but I cannot accept such a burdensome gift."

Zion looked dumbfounded.

This was the first woman he'd met who remained so composed even after seeing a Celestial King Clam pearl. No matter how noble she was, this was 200 million rolling her way all at once. Even if she had no interest in him, most would grab the outstretched hand.

Thinking he couldn't hold onto Amy this way, Zion decided to present a card that would surely captivate her, since he was already making empty promises.

"Then how about this? Bear my child. You could become royalty."

Amy looked incredulous.

'This wet-behind-the-ears brat...'

While nobles also had political marriages, royalty was even worse. They acted as if their blood had tremendous value.

Well, perhaps it was true. Even now, women lined up wanting to bear a prince's child.

But Amy didn't want to become royalty. So Zion's words were almost insulting.

"I'm leaving. I don't think we have anything more to discuss, Your Highness."

Amy walked toward the door without waiting for an answer.

"How dare...!"

Zion grabbed Amy's wrist as forcefully as his wounded pride demanded. Amy hastily shook off his hand and stepped back. Her wrist stung from how tightly he had gripped it.

'For a prince of a nation to show such disgraceful behavior.'

Amy rubbed her wrist while glaring at Zion.

"What do you think you're doing?"

Though emotion crept into her tone, the one who was actually angry was Zion.

"How dare you refuse me? A mere noble!"

Amy felt like she'd heard a novel insult.

Even Tormia's royalty showed respect to Carmis. But such thoughts only made Amy more realistic. After all, the person here wasn't just any prince, but Theraze's son.
