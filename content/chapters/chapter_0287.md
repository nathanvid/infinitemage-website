"Didn't you come along expecting this anyway? Don't you realize what a great honor it is to enter my bedroom?"

"I'm certain I told you I didn't want to."

"Hmph, how arrogant. You don't know your place."

Zion ground his teeth in frustration, then seemed to have a good idea as his smile returned.

"Fine. Then I'll give you an order as royalty. Attend to me in my chambers tonight."

"I refuse. No matter how much of a prince you are, I am nobility of Tormia. I don't follow orders from foreign nations."

"Really? You think you're that special? Then how about this? If you don't come into my arms tonight, I'll wage war against Tormia."

Amy looked at Zion with an incredulous expression.

"You think that's impossible? Kasula is going to fall into my hands anyway. Once I become king, the first thing I'll do is conquer Tormia. Your country will be destroyed because of you."

It wasn't entirely impossible. If Zion became king of Kasula, Theraze would spare no effort in providing support to help expand their influence.

Zion interpreted Amy's slow lowering of her head as a sign of resignation and smiled with vile satisfaction.

But at that moment, a cold voice flowed from Amy's lips as she looked down.

"Try it if you can."

"What?"

"If you want to wage war, go ahead and try."

"This is ridiculous. Are you going to be reckless now?"

How dare a mere noble not use honorifics with the First Prince! But compared to Amy's declaration that she wouldn't hesitate even if it meant war, it hardly seemed worth getting upset about.

"You don't think I'm joking, do you? If so, you'll definitely regret it."

Amy couldn't hold back and burst into laughter.

"You're talking nonsense. You becoming king? Don't act so superior. Your position as First Prince is already shaky."

"This is really...!"

"Yes, I might have been a little nervous if it were Empress Theraze. But you're not going to become emperor, are you? Do you think I'd be scared of a dim-witted brat like you?"

Murderous intent flashed in Zion's eyes. It was the first time in his life he'd been so thoroughly disrespected.

His thinking changed. He would absolutely not kill Amy. He would leave her just barely alive.

And he would definitely turn Tormia to ash so he could watch tears of blood flow from her eyes.

"Those words... you can definitely take responsibility for them, right?"

"Responsibility? No, I won't take responsibility for anything. Even if war breaks out because of me. If you invade our kingdom..."

Amy's Insight glowed red.

"Then I too will fight as one citizen, risking my life."

Zion flinched upon encountering the killing intent emanating from Amy's Insight.

It felt like his blood was freezing. Who would have thought such extreme resolve was contained within the girl who had blushed at the banquet hall?

'They say magicians are eccentric...'

Amy glared and stepped closer.

"You, what are you scheming? Why did you bring me to this room?"

From the circumstances so far, Zion hadn't simply dragged her here with the purpose of taking her body.

It wouldn't match his personality to mention Sirone's parents for just that reason.

'So he has business with Sirone after all, but what exactly...'

Amy's lips trembled as she finally realized.

Zion wasn't the important one. The Theraze faction was planning to settle everything tonight, win or lose.

She had to find Sirone as quickly as possible.

Entering her Spirit Zone, the door's location was conveyed through synesthesia.

'Could it be opened from the inside?'

She could open it, but she remembered that the door had been locked. Thinking she had no choice but to break through, Amy finished charging her Fireball and waited for an opportunity. The moment Zion's face twisted like a beast's, she ran for the door.

"Armand!"

The magic sword flew through the air, ignoring inertia, and landed in Zion's hand. Without even looking, Zion swung his arm and threw the sword.

Sensing the sword's trajectory through her Spirit Zone, Amy twisted her body. With a thud, Armand embedded itself in the door. If not for her Spirit Zone, she would have died.

'He really intends to kill me. So it's going to be a fight to the finish...'

Zion's leisurely expression was irritating. Given their relative abilities, cornering her should have been the perfect opportunity, yet he didn't look rushed at all.

Amy immediately realized why.

Armand. From the sword embedded in the door, she felt a sinister aura she'd never experienced before. It was horrifying just being near it, as if something disgusting was clinging to the door.

"Do you think you'll be safe after doing this? I'm also a well-known person in our kingdom."

"The Carmis family, yes. They are troublesome. But once Sirone dies, everything will be over."

Assassination is the most efficient means of overthrowing power.

Not because the dead person held important value. Because the dead cannot speak.

If Sirone died, the living could create hundreds of different scenarios. Sirone's soul might cry out from the heavens, but there would be no way to voice his grievances.

'I have to get out somehow.'

Amy bit her lip and steadied her mind. As her teeth sank into her lip and she tasted blood, the disgusting feeling from the magic sword faded slightly.

'I'll count to three and then go.'

As she counted in her mind, Zion extended his hand and recalled Armand.

Amy frowned at the unexpected situation. It was strange to block her escape route and then open it again. But she didn't think Zion could face her with a sword either.

Amy watched Zion with wary eyes.

Standing there holding his sword, there was no sense of tension on his face. Had he secretly devoted himself to swordsmanship?

But his next words contained nothing that would suggest such a sophisticated twist.

"How unfortunate. You could have had the most thrilling night of your life. Now you're going to die a virgin because of your petty noble pride."

"I won't die by your hand, but if I become a ghost, I swear I'll kill you first. If you see me in your dreams, you can believe the afterlife exists."

Zion's face contorted.

Magicians are all talk, so it's hard to get even with them in verbal sparring. Physical intimidation is the only effective remedy.

Consoling himself by imagining Amy's miserable future, he held Armand vertically close to his body and chanted.

"Diamond Armament."

With a sharp metallic sound, Armand's blade split and spread apart like spider legs.

The hilt came out and the pommel and grip separated. Following the skeletal framework like the frame of a building, red fibers resembling biological matter oozed out like oil.

Amy was gripped by an even more sinister feeling than when she'd sensed it through her Spirit Zone. Centered on the red gem, Armand transformed into a shape reminiscent of a giant spider.

What followed was even more serious. The blade, split into dozens of legs, began covering Zion from the head down as if swallowing him.

Amy frowned, but after a brief moment, the grotesque scene gradually took shape into a form pleasing to human eyes.

The part that had been the handle transformed into a helmet protecting his face, and the blade that went over his head descended down his back, adhering closely to the core muscle structure to form the basic framework.

Metal spread from that framework to form armor.

Metal that reached his wrists attached as gauntlets, and metal that went down his legs to his soles became pointed metal boots.

As the armor protected his body's vital organs, red fibers wrapped around his joints, tightly encasing his body without gaps.

Finally, an enormous amount of fiber oozed from the neck guard and transformed into a fluttering cloak.

From Amy's perspective, it happened so quickly it looked like a transformation.

Zion, his face hidden by a cross-shaped helmet, lowered his arms and clenched both fists.

Using this as a signal, an extremely thin needle pierced the back of Zion's neck and connected to his spinal cord.

There was no pain, but electricity flowed through his spine.

*Gothic*-User cerebrum copy. Share. Linguistic cognitive ability activated.

Armand's voice echoed in Zion's head and immediately began regulating his biological signals.

*Gothic*-Muscle strength enhancement. Bone density increase. Endoskeleton reinforcement. Neural transmission speed maximized. Metal proliferation complete. Weapon generation and transformation possible. Killing specialization. Close combat advantageous.

Clang! Clang!

30-centimeter blades protruded from both of Zion's gauntlets.

Amy gulped. Except for the eyes visible through the cross's grooves, all of Zion's body parts were concealed by the magic sword. From the external appearance, it seemed like fibers covered most of his body with armor layered on top.

'How is that possible?'

This was an impossible situation. Judging by the metal's weight, even roughly estimating, it was much heavier than the original magic sword. Especially if it was armor, what were those fibers?

If tough muscles protected the joints, not only durability but also mobility would be maximized. Perhaps that's why, despite wearing heavy armor, Zion displayed a much more agile demeanor than before.

Zion was pleased seeing Amy's bewildered expression.

'Hmph, of course. When would someone like her have seen anything like this?'

*Magic Sword Armand* was an S-class Objet with the contradictory characteristics of being a metallic organism.

Its functions could be broadly divided into two: first, standard control that allowed the user to manipulate the sword freely according to their will, and second, Diamond Armament that combined with the user to maximize combat ability.

In standard control mode, metallic characteristics were prominent, while in Diamond Armament mode, biological traits stood out.

Particularly, Diamond Armament could perform intelligent tasks by sharing the user's brain.

"Did I look like some dim-witted prince who just trades on the Theraze name?"

Zion took a step forward.

Clank! As the friction sound of steel boots touching the floor echoed eerily, Amy unconsciously leaned her back against the door.

"Of course, that might be possible. But so what? Before the name of Theraze, everything else is trivial. Your family, your talent—I'm not envious of any of it. Because I am..."

Zion extended his palm toward Amy.

"Glorious royalty."

The glove made of fibers writhed, then a tentacle shot out from the center of his palm and rushed toward Amy.

Even in the urgent situation, Amy confirmed that the tip of the flying tentacle was sharpening and hardening, then desperately threw herself aside.

Bang! The tentacle struck the door. At the same time, the tentacle connected to Zion's palm snapped off like a tail being severed.

Amy looked at the door with a disgusted expression. As the tentacle penetrated the surface, root-like structures spread out, completely sealing the door.

Amy bit her lip with a defeated expression.

No matter how tough the tentacle's fibers were, they didn't seem breakable with ordinary force.

"When are you going to use that fire in your hand?"

Zion slowly approached. The pressure was on a different level from Zion before Diamond Armament. It was as if Armand's sinister aura had been directly overlaid on him.

"Well, you don't really think something like that would work, do you?"

Zion held the blade protruding from his gauntlet vertically. Amy's face, glaring at Zion, was reflected on the smooth blade's surface.

**All Kinds of Variables (1)**

Even while rushing to Zion's gallery, Sirone couldn't shake off strange imaginings.

Though he told himself it was absolutely impossible, scenes he never wanted to see filled his mind.

'What am I thinking?'

He had to judge rationally.

First was Amy's motivation for following Zion. She wasn't the type to act rashly in any situation, but she was also someone who had left for danger in Galliant, worried about Jiss's safety.
