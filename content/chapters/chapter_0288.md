'Right, that happened back then too. I was late because I met Sister Marsha...'

Then it suddenly occurred to him that Amy might be upset with him for that reason. Had dancing with Sister Reina hurt her feelings?

Even going to Falcoa despite knowing it was a trapâ€”looking back now, there might have been some element of that involved.

'No. I'm overthinking this. Dancing with Sister Reina was already part of the plan. Amy wouldn't be like that.'

Even as he thought this, he couldn't be certain.

The reason was simple. When he saw Amy dancing with Zion, some unpleasant ripples had stirred in his own heart.

Amy probably wouldn't be any different, would she?

If she felt the same emotions, she might have followed Zion out for even the smallest reason.

Because Amy is such a sensitive girl.

Sirone's steps quickened. Even though he tried to control his emotions by thinking rationally, his heartbeat was racing faster than before.

"Hm?"

Sirone hurriedly stopped and looked back.

Ever since coming down to the basement, the back of his neck had felt eerily cold. But along the path he'd walked, there wasn't even a trace of presence, let alone a single mouse.

"Must be my imagination."

Sirone rubbed his neck and slowly continued walking.

'Kekeke, no good, no good.'

The man hanging upside down from the ceiling where Sirone had been grinned wickedly. It was Zenogger of the Spatur clan, who had received special orders to assassinate Sirone.

He was clinging to the ceiling using only the strength of his ten fingers.

The spider mimicry ability granted his clan the power to overcome gravity. Fine hairs sprouting from his fingertips and sticky oils seeping from his skin created a chemical reaction that supported his body weight.

Of course, this was only possible because his assassination training had honed his physical skills to the point where he could support his lower body with just his upper body strength.

Moreover, the oils seeping from his finger skin would evaporate within 20 seconds once he stopped secreting them, leaving no trace of his existence.

An assassin approaching perfection.

Zenogger extended his long tongue down to his chin before retracting it.

'Quite a perceptive prey. Like... a mosquito.'

But this was because Zenogger was continuously sending very subtle killing intent toward Sirone.

Observing the prey's reactions and considering countermeasures was basic for assassins. He could kill at any time if he wanted to. He was just gauging the situation for a 100% success rate.

'Mm, indeed.'

Assassins were those who used situations rather than brute force. That's why it was also a profession that involved spending extremely long periods alone. Having to make direct judgments and evaluations about everything had made talking to himself a habitual trait.

Zenogger liked being an assassin. It was far more sophisticated than hit-men who relied on improvisation and quick retreats.

Though his body had become too grotesque to blend in with the human world, this was precisely the pinnacle of functional beauty that the Spatur assassination clan pursued.

'Shall I... push him a bit more?'

Zenogger moved along the wall using his ten fingers, following his prey. Then he extracted spider silk from his buttocks and descended behind Sirone.

The thin thread stuck to the ceiling, propelling Zenogger's body forward. The thread would sway with even the slightest breeze, but perfect control was not difficult for the spider clan.

Sirone's head was right in front of him. Close enough that his hair would flutter if he exhaled. The white nape of his neck looked like fish flesh, arousing the desire to bite.

Zenogger grinned widely as he slowly brought his finger toward Sirone's neck.

'Let's see if you can sense this.'

Zenogger's finger approached until it was just before the fine hairs would touch. It was practically touching distance.

Sirone turned around with a startled expression.

But all he could see was just the scenery of the underground passage. Even the flickering patterns of the torches seemed exactly the same.

"What the hell?"

Something was definitely strange. He might be especially sensitive today, but he kept feeling like something was bothering him.

'Better to be sure.'

Sirone pretended to walk slowly, then suddenly expanded his Spirit Zone.

"..."

All kinds of information flowed in through synesthesia.

Countless small things were scurrying about everywhere. Since there was a food storage nearby, they were probably mice or cockroaches.

"Ugh..."

Sirone rubbed his goosebump-covered arms.

Anyway, all he could sense through synesthesia were small creatures. After days of being threatened with assassination, he wondered if something had gone wrong with his nervous system.

"Phew, let's hurry."

As Sirone moved away, a satisfied smile crossed the lips of Zenogger clinging to the ceiling.

'He took the bait. Congratulations on your death.'

A mage's Spirit Zone was one of the most troublesome abilities for close-combat assassins. It wasn't easy to approach those who expanded their consciousness and perceived things through synesthesia.

But assassins say this:

There is no sense without blind spots.

Spirit Zone comprehensively perceives all information within its range. Rather than precise sensations like sight, hearing, or touch, it was more akin to a kind of sixth sense.

So what if one assimilated with specific objects or creatures? The sixth sense that comprehensively receives information would be unable to distinguish the difference between two entities.

That blind spot of the sixth sense.

Just as creatures in nature had mastered concealment techniques through evolution, assassins had also developed unique techniques through eons of fighting against Spirit Zone.

That was the object assimilation ability: Equalizing.

'Mm, indeed.'

Sirone had sensed Zenogger's presence through Spirit Zone, but his sixth sense alone couldn't distinguish the difference between the stone wall and Zenogger.

And this was exactly what Zenogger was aiming for.

For mages, dependence on Spirit Zone was as great as ordinary people's dependence on sight. They would even think something didn't exist if they couldn't sense it with Spirit Zone.

That's why Sirone had been stimulated all this time.

Having confirmed his surroundings with Spirit Zone, Sirone's wariness was much lower than before.

Therefore, he dies.

Zenogger doesn't kill him. The situation kills him.

While hit-men specialized in quick strikes and retreats would bet their lives on 50% odds, assassins wouldn't move easily even with 99% probability. They only moved when their target took the first step into the swamp of death.

This was why high-ranking power holders feared a single assassin more than multiple armies. Once they appeared, it meant one's current situation was in the midst of death.

That didn't mean the best assassins were the best swordsmen. Equalizing was such a difficult technique that reaching mastery required dedicating one's entire life to it alone.

But they were strong.

If swordsmen fought with equal abilities from 1 to 100, assassins were those who became invincible in 1 out of 100 situations to overwhelm their opponents.

Therefore, Sirone bore no fault. He had simply trusted what he believed. And Zenogger had exploited that blind spot to render his target completely defenseless.

The current Zenogger was in an invincible state.

'Keke, shall we get going then?'

Zenogger approached Sirone along the ceiling and landed on the floor without making a sound. Then he pursed his lips and made a motion of inserting his finger and pulling something out.

A thread as hard as wire was extracted.

This would be enough.

'Indeed.'

The method Zenogger chose was the death noose.

By tying steel wire into a noose shape and throwing it at Sirone, then pulling it tight, his face would pop off like plucking grapes.

'7 seconds ahead.'

Zenogger waved the fluttering thread in the air and instantly tied a noose knot. Then, riding the air currents, it advanced gracefully and floated above Sirone's head like a kite.

Perfect murder without sound, presence, or even smell.

'4 seconds ahead. 3 seconds. 2 seconds.'

The noose that passed through Sirone's face descended to around his neck.

'Now!'

Zenogger pulled the thread with a grotesque grin.

The sharp spider silk noose instantly tightened its perimeter, bunching up to a size smaller than a grain of rice.

"..."

Sirone sat on the ground having fallen on his bottom, looking back at Zenogger.

"What, what? Who are you?"

"..."

Zenogger stared like someone who had lost all thinking ability. No matter how he thought about it, he couldn't understand the current situation.

The moment he tightened the noose, Sirone suddenly lowered his body and rolled on the ground. Then he looked back and made eye contact with him.

'What? Where did the calculation go wrong?'

Sirone should die. Because that's the situation.

Therefore, he bore no fault. There must have been an unexpected variable.

Sirone swallowed and glared at Zenogger.

After confirming his surroundings with Spirit Zone, he had been walking without worry when suddenly a voice shouted "Danger!" loudly in his head.

Without time to think, he rolled on the ground. When he looked back, a man with a sinister appearance was staring at him.

Zenogger asked in an ominous voice.

"How... did you dodge it?"

Sirone furrowed his brow at the incomprehensible words.

'How did I dodge it? Well, obviously...'

Because he heard someone's voice. But judging by the reaction, it seemed the opponent hadn't heard it.

Then came the sound of glass breaking from his pocket.

Without taking his eyes off Zenogger, Sirone searched his pocket. What he pulled out was the gem Woorin had said was worth well over 100 million, now split into two pieces.

Zenogger's shoulders twitched. The gem he saw in Sirone's hand through his insect eyes was definitely the one he knew.

"The Last Cry of the Jaeger Family?"

There was no possibility Sirone would have that. But it was definitely the Last Cry of the Jaeger Family. Otherwise, there would be no reason for him to escape death from his perfect design.

'Damn... of all things.'

According to records, there was the Jaeger family on the western continent 480 years ago.

Then one day, an incident occurred where people from the main house were assassinated one by one each day. No matter how much they strengthened security, without fail, one corpse would be found each morning.

The family head made every effort to find the culprit, but there was no way to stop the daily increasing number of victims.

When the family members had fallen to less than half, he made an extreme choice.

He sealed the mansion.

But that night, another servant died.

The family head intuited that the assassin was inside and interrogated the family members. But he couldn't find any suspicious points in anyone, and as time passed, the main house members who had numbered 287 were reduced to 63.

The family was already as good as ruined.

Everyone's spirits were devastated, and they wouldn't even speak to each other due to mutual distrust.

The family head no longer made efforts.

Whoever died, he would just wait. As long as he could confirm the culprit's identity, he didn't care even if his family died.

On the 286th day since the assassinations began.

Only two people remained in the mansion.

The family head and his most beloved youngest daughter.

"How, how could it be you...?"

The family head couldn't believe the reality before his eyes.

He was not the assassin. Therefore, the culprit must be his fourteen-year-old youngest daughter.

"No! I'm not the culprit, Father! I really am not!"

The family head drew the sword at his waist.

He had to kill her. No matter how beloved his daughter was, everyone had died because of her.

But the family head couldn't kill his daughter.

Because she was already dead.

Looking down blankly at his youngest daughter who had become a corpse, the family head finally realized and trembled.

Finally, all secrets were solved.

The sword fell and both knees hit the floor.

"No, no! This can't be! No!"

The family head clutched his head and screamed.

There was no one left to die. Except for himself alone.

He took strong liquor and headed to his study. Sitting at his desk, he recorded the 286 days of incidents in a single letter.

The family head's life or death was never confirmed to the end.

Opinions were divided on whether he left the mansion or was the last person to be assassinated, but anyway, the Jaeger family disappeared from the world.

Two years later, a merchant acquired the Jaeger family mansion at a bargain price.

Since it was the family head's private property, no one could touch it, but after the legal deadline of two years passed, the kingdom sold it.

When the doors of the mansion sealed for two years were flung wide open, the first thing that entered the merchant's eyes were 287 red beads scattered on the floor.

This is the secret story of the Last Cry of the Jaeger Family. It was also the example the Curia auction company cited for why Objets were not 100% safe.
