The true origins behind the creation of actual Objets are not clearly revealed anywhere.

Names of objects have simply been passed down from someone, and through these, people merely spread their wings of imagination.

However, *The Last Cry of the Jaeger Family* is unique in that actual records remain.

The merchant who acquired the mansion soon discovered what abilities the 287 beads possessed.

When carried, the moment one encounters killing intent, a girl's warning can be heard. It was such a sensitive alarm system that even the restrained killing intent of supreme masters could not escape its detection.

The merchant is said to have sold it at auction and became the richest person on the continent. The 287 Objets then passed into the hands of rulers from various nations, and it's estimated that about 82 remain today.

'Indeed.'

This was the story Zenogger had heard during his assassination training days.

That's why the current situation was all the more bizarre.

There was no way Shirone could possess an item that only the highest nobles or royalty of each nation could even hope to obtain.

"Where did you... get that? You don't seem to have such a valuable life."

Shirone hurriedly got to his feet and took a fighting stance.

"What are you? What were you trying to do to me?"

Without answering, Zenogger swept his hand through the air.

Threads tangled together, forming visible white thread balls that wound around his wrists. Connecting one end to the ceiling and pulling, his body shot upward at tremendous speed.

Shirone cast teleportation. But Zenogger's figure had already completely vanished from sight.

He was an incredible master. At least from Shirone's perspective.

Zenogger pursued Shirone while moving along the walls.

He could eliminate this target with over 90% certainty using hitman methods anyway. Most importantly, there wouldn't be another *Last Cry of the Jaeger Family*, so the fact that Shirone would die remained unchanged.

Shirone couldn't escape.

However he had hidden it until now, Zenogger's killing intent was suffocating.

Moreover, the source of killing intent wasn't from just one location. It meant he was disrupting the synesthesia of the Spirit Zone at tremendous speed.

'I'll die at this rate!'

In this desperate situation, Shirone abandoned escape. Instead, he thrust his fist downward and cast Photon Cannon with all his might.

BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!

The underground walls shook as dust cascaded down.

"Kekeke! Magic, it's magic."

While no profession in the world looks down on mages, the assassination clan Spatur had manuals for dealing with every situation.

When Zenogger pursed his lips, spider silk twisted into a steel wire shot out. The wire penetrated straight through the Photon Cannon and pierced Shirone's shoulder.

"Urgh!"

Shirone hurriedly pulled out the thread and rolled on the ground. Though not a fatal wound, this single strike made him clearly realize the difference in their abilities.

Expansive defensive magic like Photon Cannon boasts wide-ranging defensive power, but inevitably has weaknesses against localized penetration.

A skilled fighter who could immediately identify weaknesses and respond upon seeing magic. His thinking speed probably far exceeded Shirone's.

Zenogger, who had been staying outside Shirone's field of vision, dropped down with a thud. Landing with both hands on the ground, he was the perfect spider.

Zenogger's tongue extended long and licked his entire face.

"Kiki, good reflexes. I aimed for the heart but you dodged. A kid like you is my type. I'd love to tie you up with spider webs and dote on you plenty, but..."

Shirone shuddered with a creepy feeling.

"I'm also quite busy."

When Zenogger disappeared from sight faster than before, Shirone fell into an impossible-to-judge state.

While mages can produce powerful effects that transcend human common sense, it was true that they struggled against those who had pushed their physical abilities to the extreme in one-on-one combat.

Zenogger was a master unlike any he'd seen before. Thinking he could respond from the beginning had been a misjudgment.

Shirone turned completely around and deployed teleportation.

If escape was impossible and facing him was difficult, the only remaining option was to hide and buy time.

The flash that became light bounced off walls as it moved and entered the food storage. The space was enormous enough to feed hundreds of castle residents, divided into sections by food type.

Shirone hid with his back against wheat sacks piled like castle walls. Though he hadn't cast magic for particularly long, he was already breathing hard.

'Where might he target me from? The ceiling? Behind the sacks? Or the opposite section?'

Shirone moved his gaze trying to find traces of Zenogger.

But in reality, Zenogger was embedded in the corner ceiling of the warehouse, completely different from Shirone's expectations.

'Kikiki, foolish. To think common sense would work against a mimic.'

Zenogger's eight eyes precisely captured Shirone.

Zion's combat power, borrowing the strength of his Armament, matched that of a certified swordsman. He was unleashing sharp attacks without giving Amy a chance to cast teleportation.

Seeing Amy's pale face, Zion felt somewhat satisfied. Armand, rated as an S-class Objet even among dealers, was certainly worth its price.

Effort doesn't suit royalty. Of course, neither does talent. The reason royalty is noble is solely bloodlineâ€”with that bloodline, one can simply buy effort and talent.

"You're holding up quite well though."

He certainly hadn't expected the battle to drag on this long. Thinking she was a weak mage, her movements were as agile as a swordsman's.

"Hmph, so you've been thoroughly preparing since childhood? That makes it all the more pitiful. To be defeated by me, who learned neither magic nor swordsmanship."

"Stop spouting nonsense! I'll never lose to someone like you who only relies on weapons!"

Amy gritted her teeth and charged at Zion.

She was frustrated to the point of tears. These were the results of ten years of daily effort without missing a single day. Someone who had never experienced hardship in his life couldn't defeat her just by wielding a single magic sword.

Amy utilized her Schema's abilities to the maximum, deploying disruption tactics. But correspondingly, Armand also altered Zion's constitution.

<Gothic> - Enemy entity acceleration change detection. Retinal afterimage removal. Visual cognitive ability maximization.

Afterimages occur because the human brain remembers objects for one-tenth of a second after seeing them.

But when Armand removed retinal afterimages, Amy's movements came through clearly as if cut into distinct frames.

Zion stood still for a moment, then suddenly launched his body. The sword mounted on his gauntlet sliced through space, grazing Amy's collar.

Zion wasn't a Schema user. But the physical coordination ability of his Armament was reproducing Schema effects exactly.

'No. I absolutely cannot accept this!'

Amy bit her lip.

To avoid Zion's gaze required speed that transcended his cognitive abilities. But her Schema wasn't at that level.

'Then...'

Amy entered the Spirit Zone.

She didn't know how effective magic would be in a narrow space against an agile warrior equipped with close-range weapons, but when orthodox methods didn't work, it was a situation where survival itself was difficult.

'Take this!'

Amy spread Fireballs in all directions. Instead of targeting, it was a tactic to restrict movement through suppression.

'Tch! Annoying.'

Zion abandoned his charge and retreated.

The gallery contained numerous Objets. While only Armand mattered, the problem was that most of them belonged to Woorin.

'I need to preserve the Objets for now.'

Reading Zion's emotions, Armand extended tentacles in all directions.

When the tentacles attached to the walls, Zion's body lifted.

With tension acting, Zion's body flew like a flying insect. Swinging his sword at tremendous speed, he split a Fireball in two.

Amy snorted.

'Hmph, you think you can block it like that?'

Even when the form changes, heat doesn't disappear.

As expected, flames engulfed Zion and a combustion reaction occurred in Armand's organic material.

But the epidermis that had hardened like charcoal fell away and was filled with new organic material.

Regeneration was truly the strength of living things. The reason *Magic Sword Armand* was S-class was because it possessed the advantages of both metal and living organisms.

Having blocked the Fireball, Zion looked down at Amy while suspended in mid-air.

"You have quite a fiery personality. But you won't be able to act up any longer."

Amy retreated and surrounded herself with Fire Mist. While it couldn't exactly reverse the tide of battle, nothing beat heat for blocking the approach of living things.

"Hmph, you're really going wild."

Amy knew it too. The fact that all she could manage was improvisation was miserable.

But the opponent's movements were unpredictable, and in the narrow space, even her specialty Sniper Mode was impossible.

However, she didn't give up because she saw a glimmer of hope. For reasons unknown, Zion's movements clearly showed he disliked the destruction of items in the room.

'They don't even look that expensive.'

Though she was puzzled, it was the only gap in the current situation. Amy experimentally shot a Fire Strike blatantly toward the display case.

As expected, Zion launched his body. Tentacles extending from over his shoulder blocked the Fire Strike's path.

With a bang, the tips of the tentacles burned away.

Amy, who had intended to sever the tentacles, clicked her tongue at their stronger durability than expected.

But her magic was just beginning. Rotating her targeted Spirit Zone, she rained Fire Strikes in all directions.

Though Zion blocked them repeatedly by swinging his tentacles, even Armand's durability had limits.

'Hmph! Then I just need to catch the mage!'

One tentacle pressed against Amy's nape and pushed forward. Her head struck the wall and her consciousness wavered momentarily, but she activated Insight to immediately reset.

"Urgh, you think something like this can stop me..."

At that moment, sharp needles shot out from the tentacle and pierced her neck. The Spirit Zone disappeared and her magic was dispelled.

Zion came down to the ground while hearing Armand's voice.

<Gothic> - User pituitary hormone extraction. Combination. Nerve stabilizing substance production. Complete. Injection.

The human body was no different from a massive chemical factory. Armand had extracted hormones from Zion's body to manufacture its own unique nerve stabilizing substance.

Amy couldn't hold onto her clouding consciousness.

'Damn...! What kind of sword is this?'

She tried activating Insight, but with endless nerve stabilizers flooding in, she couldn't muster the concentration to form a Spirit Zone. Rather, more chemicals flooded in, poisoning her liver.

"Huhu, mages are finished once you just muddle their minds. Both you and Shirone. What's so great about that pathetic magic that makes you so arrogant?"

Amy gasped for breath while looking up at the ceiling. Her eyes rolled back on their own, making it difficult to look down.

"It must be hard, so why don't you just faint? I'll play with your body nicely in the meantime. Of course, don't think you'll wake up with your limbs intact."

"Kuk! Kurgh...!"

Amy desperately resisted.

"Hahaha! What a sight, watching you struggle. Now do you understand? What happens when you mess with royalty?"

Amy squeezed out the last of her strength and activated Insight.

"Really?"

Zion snorted. He knew she couldn't enter the Spirit Zone anyway.

But the next moment, something amazing happened. A lump of flame blazed above Amy's hand.

Before Zion could organize his thoughts, Amy threw the flame toward the shelf.

"Damn! Block it!"

When Zion's consciousness focused on the shelf, Armand retracted its tentacles and launched its master's body backward.

Just before the display case exploded, Zion barely managed to block the front. The moment he held his breath, bracing for the hot heat, the fireball anticlimactically disappeared before his eyes.

"Wha, what?"

It was Jack O'Lantern's fake flame. Since spirits have their own independent Spirit Zone, casting was possible regardless of Amy's mental state.
