Amy, freed from the tentacles, used Insight to initialize her mind. Though nausea surged from too much sedative, she barely managed to enter her Spirit Zone.

Equipped with her most powerful Fireball, Amy rushed toward the door while swinging her hand. The powerful Fireball crashed into the organically intertwined door, shattering it to pieces.

By the time Zion realized he had been deceived, the second door was already being blown apart.

"Damn it...!"

Zion unfairly blamed Armand.

"What the hell did you do? You let her get away!"

It was the typical behavior of an inexperienced user.

Though Armand could copy the user's brain to gain intelligence, it was strictly speaking just a sword that lived symbiotically with its master. It couldn't make judgments on behalf of its owner regarding any situation.

Therefore, cursing at Armand was no different from cursing his own stupid head.

"We need to chase her. Let's go."

As if responding to Zion's words, countless tentacles extended from the Armament and embedded into the walls. Zion rose with the power of the tentacles and propelled himself forward like swinging on vines.

Reina stopped walking and turned her ear toward the direction of the sound. The ability of Sound of Silence detected the massive vibration that had echoed from underground.

The sound transmitted through the walls was certainly faint. But the fact that it could be heard all the way here in a castle boasting the kingdom's greatest durability meant that tremendous impact had occurred at the epicenter.

'He's underground!'

Reina launched herself toward the stairs visible before her.

The kind of power that could shake a building was impossible even with an ordinary swordsman's blade work. Surely Shirone had cast magic.

The moment she set foot underground, she heard someone running from the end of the corridor. Examining the rhythm of the footsteps, it was the movement of someone extremely agitated.

Reina pressed herself against the wall, wary of the approaching opponent. Through the veil of darkness, she saw one person running toward her.

Reina hastily blocked the way when she spotted Amy.

"Amy!"

"Eek! You scared me! Sister?"

"What? Why are you here?"

"Let's run first!"

As if there was no time to explain, Amy grabbed Reina's arm and ran. Reina activated her Schema to match Amy's speed.

Bang! Bang!

Heavy impacts striking the wall surfaces could be heard.

Reina deactivated Sound of Silence. If she continued listening to vibrations in this state, her eardrums would burst.

"What? Is some monster following us?"

Amy sighed. She wanted to tell the ridiculous story of what she had experienced, but finding Shirone was the urgent priority.

"I'll tell you later. What about Shirone?"

"This way. I heard sounds from over there."

The two entered the left fork and looked at the warehouse waiting at the end of the single path. A sign hanging from the ceiling read "Food Storage."

Upon entering, the interior was in complete chaos from battle traces.

Flour was spilled everywhere, and some parts had dissolved like smoke, making the air opaque. Vegetables appeared to have been sliced and were lying in pieces, covered in flour. Amy was grateful this wasn't a meat storage room.

"Where is Shirone?"

As Amy looked around while walking, Reina spread her arms to block her.

"Dangerous. Don't move."

Startled, Amy examined where Reina was glaring. Through the flour smoke, countless spider webs were strung up.

"This is...!"

Coming to her senses and looking around, spider webs were everywhere. It was an eerie sight, like a warehouse sealed for a hundred years.

"Why are there spider webs in a place like this? And they seem to be from an incredibly large spider."

"Be careful. Something's here."

Reina placed Amy behind her and slowly passed between the spider webs.

At that moment, a faint voice came from across where sacks were piled up.

"...Run."

Reina and Amy simultaneously launched themselves toward that location.

Shirone was hanging upside down in a giant spider web. His clothes were tattered everywhere, and countless cuts were carved into his body.

Tears welled up in Amy's eyes.

"Shirone!"

"Run away... This guy... incredibly strong..."

"Wait! I'll save you right now!"

Amy immediately ran over.

Just imagining an unknown person caught in a spider web was creepy enough, but the fact that it was Shirone was shockingly terrifying.

After examining the spider web for a moment, she grabbed it with her hands and tried to tear it when she found no other way. Sharp pain shot through her. When she let go and examined her hands, her palms were cleanly cut.

"What kind of spider web is this?"

Shirone shouted with all his remaining strength.

"Amy! Run away!"

At that moment, Reina embraced Amy's waist and launched herself. The sharp wind sound was a sound wave that could never be heard except by Reina's hearing.

Amy, who had fallen to the floor, looked back at Reina without understanding what happened. But her gaze was fixed somewhere in the darkness.

"Keke, not bad."

Zenogger, hanging upside down next to Shirone, came down.

Amy and Reina were startled by the man's bizarre appearance. Though the torch was far away and they couldn't see clearly, he definitely had multiple pupils.

"When strings move, they create vibrations. If you have the ability to hear those vibrations, you certainly can't be killed by two-dimensional cutting. Yes, indeed."

Amy stepped forward and shouted.

"What did you do to Shirone! Let him go right now!"

Zenogger turned his head while matching eye level with the upside-down Shirone.

"Ah, this? I caught him for now, kiki. As you can tell by touching it, it's quite sharp. If he struggles, his whole body will be cut to pieces. That's why he can't move even a fingertip."

"You...!"

Just as Amy was about to express her outrage, Zenogger spoke.

"Now, here's a question. So when did the wounds on Shirone's body occur? Number 1, they occurred before being caught in the spider web. Number 2, they occurred after being caught in the spider web."

Amy didn't understand why that was important in the current situation.

But as she pondered Zenogger's words, her face gradually turned red with anger. If the answer was the latter, she was determined to wring Zenogger's neck no matter what.

"You, I'll never forgive you."

When Amy became angry, Zenogger felt somewhat comforted. In fact, number 2 was his favorite game. If you put prey on a spider web and gradually inflict wounds, the prey becomes unable to move or not move.

But unfortunately, the correct answer was number 1.

Shirone's senses, having perceived the assassin's presence, were truly tremendous even from Zenogger's perspective. It was only after a full 10 minutes of pursuit that he had finally managed to bind him in the spider web.

Zion's voice came from the warehouse entrance.

"What? Still not finished?"

Amy looked back with a dismayed expression. Zion, with tentacles hanging down like octopus legs, was arrogantly looking down with his arms behind his back.

Amy and Reina immediately turned back to back.

Shirone was captured by the assassin and even their escape route was blocked. All circumstances were turning unfavorable.

But Zion paid no attention to the two women.

Though Reina chasing here was unexpected, she was a rat in a trap anyway. Rather, he was more interested in Shirone caught in the spider web.

Zenogger, who had landed on the ground, bowed to show respect.

"Have you arrived, Prince? I was just about to finish up."

"Finish up? You're way past the promised time. What happened here?"

"I apologize."

Zenogger didn't make excuses. No matter how excellent an assassin he was, he had no choice but to give one reprieve to someone possessing *The Last Cry of the Jaeger Family*, but Spatur's pride came solely from skill.

Zion waved his hand as if annoyed.

"Whatever, just finish the job quickly. Cut off Shirone's head."

Zenogger immediately bowed his head and climbed onto the spider web where Shirone was bound. But when he was about to finish the job, someone came to mind.

"One person still hasn't shown up."

He was referring to Arius.

But Zion wasn't concerned.

Scale mages' specialty, Flicker magic, could be called short-distance teleportation occurring from extreme space-time distortion.

Even if imprisoned, as long as there was no magic control device, Scale mages could move to the opposite side in an instant.

Therefore, time and space weren't very important to Arius. He was probably watching for an opportunity to appear from some coordinate in space-time right now.

"He'll be waiting. Now, quickly separate Shirone's head from his body."

"Understood."

Amy took a combat stance and shouted.

"How ridiculous! Who do you think will just let that happen?"

Zion finally looked back at the women and emitted killing intent. Tentacles rose over his shoulders, ready to spring out like a witch's claws.

Even in his fading consciousness, Shirone instinctively realized that the armor surrounding Zion's body was Armand's true form.

Thinking that everyone would die if things continued like this, he struggled without caring about his flesh being torn and shouted.

"Run away! Sister Reina, take Amy and run!"

Amy didn't listen at all.

What use would running away be if Shirone died? For now, there was no choice but to settle things with Zion.

Reina, seeming to reach the same conclusion, widened her stride and glared at Zion.

Ozent was a family that revered swords. Though she held no weapon, the skills honed since childhood were by no means easy.

Amy and Reina split left and right to attack Zion from both sides. Then unexpectedly, Armand's reaction became noticeably weaker.

No matter how much of a symbiote it was, all decisions were made by Zion. But having no combat experience, he couldn't properly respond to the pincer attack, and to that extent, Armand's tentacles couldn't find accurate strike points either.

Amy immediately noticed the opponent's change.

'He must have looked down on me! I'll pay him back properly!'

Zion gritted his teeth at the unexpected situation. The visible magic was being blocked by Armand's tentacles, but the invisible Reina bothered him.

"Damn it! These bitches!"

Zion retreated as much as possible and blocked the doorway. Anyway, if he could subdue his opponents, he should at least block the escape route.

But that was exactly what the two had been aiming for.

Reina made a wide detour around the warehouse, stepped on sacks, and jumped up.

"Over here!"

Any knight wouldn't have turned around at Reina's voice. Even a child would know who was more dangerous between bare-handed Reina and magic-wielding Amy.

But Zion turned around in his urgency, and Amy cast Fire Strike, aiming for that blind spot.

'It's over!'

Just as Amy thought that, her body was suddenly caught by a strange force and sent flying. She struggled to break free from the inertia, but it was irresistible.

While flying, she looked back at Reina and finally understood what had happened.

A thread ball that had flown like a cannonball unraveled and turned into spider webs that engulfed Reina. Her body stuck to the wall near the ceiling along with the spider webs.

The moment she confirmed that, Amy also crashed into the wall, feeling intense pain in her back.

She looked down at the spider web pressing down on her. Even trying to break it with force, it was too tough.

If what bound Shirone was sharp steel wire like a blade, this was like sticky mucus.

Reina and Amy struggled with all their might, but Zenogger wasn't one to just leave them be.

Zenogger inflated his upper body like a balloon and spat out spider web balls from his mouth.

The spider webs that kept shooting out spread wide at the midpoint and continued to cover Reina and Amy.

"Grrruuugh!"

The binding force grew stronger each time spider webs stuck to them.

When more than five layers stuck, Amy finally became unable to move at all. Reina, stuck to the opposite wall, was in the same situation.

"Keke, such struggling. Are you alright, Prince?"

Only then did Zion breathe a sigh of relief and come down to the floor. Seeing the three people, who had been like flies, bound and unable to even struggle, he was deeply satisfied.
