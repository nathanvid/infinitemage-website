Zion turned to look at Amy with mockery.

"Hah, serves you right. You should have known better than to mess with the wrong person."

"You coward! Release this right now!"

"Don't worry. I'll release you. But first, enjoy the show."

Zion turned halfway around and gave orders to Zenogger.

"Bring me Shirone's head."

Zenogger smiled wickedly and climbed up the spider web where Shirone was bound.

Using his mimicry abilities to control his center of gravity, he moved freely across the steel wires without sustaining a single injury.

"Amy! Amy!"

Even in this life-threatening situation, Shirone called out to Amy.

Seeing this made Zion even happier. He wanted to torment Amy right in front of Shirone, but his desire to quickly obtain Ataraxia was no less pressing.

'Wait, but where's Arius?'

He had set up the perfect stage, so Arius should have made his appearance by now.

Though he felt slightly uneasy, it made no sense for a Scale mage who dealt with time and space to be late to a promised location. He would probably appear with a flash at the last moment.

'Tch, making unnecessary theatrics. Always putting on airs.'

It wasn't like he didn't know Arius's personality from the start. Arius had his professional pride, so whatever happened, he would do his job properly.

Zion took one last look around and made a throat-slitting gesture.

Zenogger, who was pinning down Shirone, stuck out his tongue and flicked it as if he was about to lick his face. But Shirone didn't even look at him, shouting to Amy with all the strength he could muster.

"Amy! Run away!"

"Kekeke, how pitiful. But you're going to die anyway."

Zenogger positioned himself with his arms and legs spread wide, pinning Shirone down. There was a thudding sound from his side, and two new arms emerged from inside his collar.

Shirone's face turned pale at the sight.

"Keke, what? Disgusting? But I can make up to six arms."

Zenogger used his two new arms to pull steel wire from his mouth. With skilled technique, he wrapped it around Shirone's neck once.

"There won't be any pain. I'm the best in the business."

Shirone sensed death approaching and closed his eyes. His short 18-year life seemed to be ending here. But he couldn't die like this. He shouted with all his might.

"Amy! This...!"

"Snip!"

Before Shirone could finish his words, Zenogger laughed grotesquely and pulled the steel wire with both arms. The spider web buried into Shirone's skin, leaving a ring-like cut on his neck.

At the same time, a crackling sound of electricity came from behind Zenogger. It was the distinctive noise of Flicker magic, the trademark of Scale mages.

'I thought so.'

Zion clicked his tongue at Arius's showboating. At any rate, his timing was impeccable, so there was nothing to be angry about.

"Huh?"

A puzzled light flickered in Zion's eyes.

It wasn't Arius. Or was it Arius? With his face covered by a mask, it was impossible to identify him.

"What's with that getup?"

The masked figure didn't answer and rolled across the ground to block the key position leading to Reina and Amy. Just from the position he secured upon appearing, it was clear he wasn't an ally.

'It's not Arius? Then where is that bastard? Shirone is already dead...'

Zion hastily turned his head toward Zenogger. He was making his usual grotesque smile, but it was a subtly distorted expression that could never be seen in reality.

Shirone was also staring wide-eyed at Amy. And most importantly, the steel wire... remained frozen, barely buried in Shirone's skin without moving.

At that moment, another crackling sound of Flicker magic was heard.

As soon as Arius appeared in space, he rolled across the ground and stopped next to Zion. He was drenched in sweat, showing the toll of his ordeal.

"Damn! Am I late?"

Zion couldn't contain his irritation and shouted.

"What! What's going on? Who is that guy?"

"I don't know. But he's definitely a time magic unlocker. I tried to shake him off somehow, but he kept disrupting my coordinates..."

Within the space-time field, the two had attempted Flicker over 700 times. The masked figure had also struggled considerably, but ultimately it was Arius who arrived late.

'Damn. The worst possible matchup.'

For a space specialist, a time specialist was like a natural enemy. Actually, the same could be said if you flipped it around.

A relationship like fire and water, where each was wary of the other.

The fact that the masked figure had arrived before him meant his skills were among the highest tier of Scale mages.

'Just who is he? With that level of skill, he should be a mage I know.'

And that's precisely why he wore a mask.

The reason for covering his entire face was probably to completely conceal his identity. At that level anyway, he could replace vision with his Spirit Zone.

Several suspects came to Arius's mind. But none of them had any plausible reason to stand in his way in this situation.

Zion couldn't hold back and approached Shirone, swinging the blade of his gauntlet.

"Tch! Fine! I'll handle it myself!"

"Don't approach!"

Zion flinched and stopped walking.

Arrogant by nature, he was more annoyed at being yelled at than relieved to have escaped danger.

"Why not? He can't even move anyway."

"That's a time field, the specialty of time-type unlockers. Simply put, it's slow magic converted to detached form."

"Detached form? Speak so I can understand."

Arius found Zion pathetic, but there was no choice.

Considering that battle was about to break out, he needed to inform him of the key points while facing off against the masked figure.

He didn't expect much from Zion's combat ability, but depending on how it was used, Armand could be helpful.

"If you enter the field, you'll end up in the same state as him."

Zion examined Shirone and Zenogger frozen in time.

Being in such a state with enemies right in front of you would be terrifying.

"Don't get close. The moment you touch it, anyone will end up the same way."

"Then what if that guy makes the first move?"

"That's impossible too. If the caster enters a detached-type Spirit Zone, the detached form breaks. Meaning time returns to normal. That masked guy has no choice but to maintain this state."

Arius kept his guard up against the masked figure while carefully examining the field.

The radius wasn't as large as expected. But since he was clearly a time-type specialist, the time distortion would be tremendous.

'Huh?'

Arius felt something strange and stared intently at the time field. More precisely, at Zenogger and Shirone trapped within it.

'They're moving...?'

Zenogger's arms were moving.

Of course, even with his extremely refined senses, it was at a level he couldn't visually confirm, but he definitely 'felt' that they were moving.

'What the hell is going on?'

Given the opponent's skill level that he had realized during their Flicker chase, extreme time distortion should have been applied.

But at this rate, visible movement could probably be confirmed in just an hour or so.

'Calculating the time to dive down to the first-stage maternal consciousness...'

Arius swallowed dryly.

It wasn't over yet.

Since the brain wasn't completely separated from the body, there would be unconscious pressure, but in any case, Shirone had received a shock close to death.

Moreover, by the time he reached the first stage, Shirone's condition would worsen further, so if they could seize advantageous ground, there was plenty of chance for victory.

"Your Highness, I'm opening a door."

"What? Now?"

"There's still a possibility. But unfortunately, I'll need to borrow some strength. Please follow immediately after I go in."

Arius activated door magic outside the field. As his Spirit Zone materialized, a two-meter-high oval sphere was born.

When Arius jumped in, Zion bit his molars with a troubled expression.

But there was no time to hesitate. He didn't want to face that masked figure here anyway.

"Damn! What a hassle!"

Zion retracted his tentacles and threw himself into the door.

Only then did the masked figure straighten from his crouched position. After thinking for a moment, he ran toward the door without looking back.

"Wait!"

The masked figure, who had stopped in front of the door, turned to look at Amy.

"Please take me too! It's similar to a gate to heaven, right? I've been there before. I can help rescue Shirone."

The masked figure spoke for the first time.

"How do you plan to enter in that state?"

"Well... if you could release this..."

"Ignite."

"What?"

Amy looked at the masked figure with surprised eyes.

"Don't you know Ignite? Aren't you a fire mage? Spider webs with high adhesion are weak to fire. You could have escaped with flame magic."

"Ah..."

Amy wore a blank expression. Even reflecting on it herself, she couldn't understand why she hadn't thought of it.

Because it was an urgent situation?

Of course, that was part of it. But to be precise, she hadn't been able to pull it up from her subconscious.

Flames from a Spirit Zone don't burn the mage, but the fire generated when burning spider webs does burn the mage.

That cost-benefit calculation had suppressed the idea. Even while Shirone was dying.

'Why did I...'

Amy's eyes welled up with tears as she hung her head.

"There's no need for self-blame. Without proper training, it's hard to respond to such situations. You have too little experience. Following me would be dangerous. It won't take long. Wait here."

"No! I'm coming with you!"

Amy shouted with eyes burning with fierce determination. If she let the masked figure go like this, she felt she would regret it for the rest of her life.

'It's not because I'm scared! It's not because I'm afraid of fire!'

She really hadn't thought of it. But Shirone would have... thought of it.

Maybe what he was trying to say at the end was Ignite? Even in a life-threatening situation, he was trying to save her by saying that...

'Shirone! I will definitely rescue you!'

When she cast Fire Mist, flames shot up on the spider web. As the masked figure said, it really burned well. Amy squeezed her eyes shut, not caring if her face got damaged.

At that moment, the heat suddenly disappeared.

When she opened her eyes, the masked man was standing there, having grabbed and thrown the spider web into the air. Like thread used in magic tricks, the spider web burned away quickly and disappeared.

"Why... why did you...?"

The masked figure sighed and knelt down in front of Amy.

"Foolish. Even if you had escaped, the result wouldn't have changed. Unless the opponent was an idiot, Shirone's death would have just been hastened."

Amy immediately stood up.

This man was truly strong. And even now, he wasn't giving up and was trying to do something.

"Let me go. No, I'll go by myself now."

"Amy! I'm going too! Release me!"

Reina, stuck high up, struggled with her ankles and shouted.

Amy cast Ignite between her fingers and asked.

"Will you be okay? It'll be hot."

"My insides are burning more right now! Hurry up! The tunnel might close."

Amy smiled slightly and increased the flames between her thumb and index finger.

Even a slight touch of heat would instantly ignite it, but with gravity's influence, she might not suffer severe burns if she fell.

But before she could even cast the magic, the spider web split vertically and Reina fell down.

Amy looked at the masked figure with bewilderment. Just who was this person who had precisely cut only the spider web with a simple Wind Cutter? He was at least a master she couldn't encounter within her own network.

Reina landed gracefully and approached Amy.

She also looked at the masked figure with curiosity. He didn't seem like a bad person, but since his identity was unknown, she didn't lower her guard.

The masked figure examined the state of the door. Energy fields were strongly emanating from the edges of space. It was proof that its lifespan was coming to an end.
