"Since it's come to this, I won't try to stop you. However, I'd like to advise you to wait. If you go in, I can't guarantee your lives. Leave Sirone to me."

The masked figure quickly spoke and leaped through the door.

Amy examined Sirone's condition.

She could clearly see the spider web's thread tightening around his neck. Moreover, his focus hadn't moved even slightly from where he had been bound.

But since he wasn't completely stopped, if left like this, he would inevitably die.

Amy and Reina looked at each other and met eyes. Without hesitation, they jumped through the door.

Five seconds later, the door disappeared.

Zenogger and Sirone were frozen at the crossroads between life and death, slowly thawing. A very slow "guh-" sound leaked from between Sirone's lips.

He probably wanted to shout "Ignite."

**The Great Secret (1)**

\<Separate> Sirone's consciousness. 11th level surface psychology.

Crash!

Thunder struck. It was weather with torrential rain. Dark clouds completely covered the sky, making it impossible to tell whether it was day or night.

Amy looked around the streets while being pelted by the pouring rain. The city was definitely somewhere she'd never seen before, but somehow it felt familiar.

Buildings lined up along brick-paved roads, and each shop had torches burning with whale oil hanging from them. Even those were weakened by the harsh wind.

The commonly seen beggars had all taken shelter, and only men in ready-made clothes were hurrying along the road with their collars pulled tight.

In the distance, a carriage covered with a rainproof tarp was heading toward the city gates to leave the city.

It was probably daytime.

Amy and Reina looked at each other while shivering from the cold. Their rain-soaked clothes clung to their bodies, and their hair looked like drowned rats.

"Where on earth is this...?"

"You came in after all."

The two women instinctively covered their bodies and turned around. Although they were clothed, their figures were revealed, so they couldn't help but be wary.

A masked man walked out from the darkness of an alley.

"I thought that might happen, so I was waiting."

Amy asked.

"Who are you? What's your relationship with Sirone?"

Instead of answering, the man removed his mask. She had wondered how he could see ahead with his face covered, but thin bandages were covering his eyes. He had been blind from the start.

"I'm called Generateid Armin. Sirone and I have a bit of history together."

Amy tilted her head. History with Sirone?

Of course, Sirone would have connections that others didn't know about. But if he knew someone of this level of skill, he wouldn't have failed to mention it.

"How can we believe that? Sirone never said anything about..."

Armin ignored her and looked around somewhere, then pointed alternately at the two women and said.

"First, let's get out of this rain. Follow me."

Standing in the downpour for just a few minutes had already caused their body temperature to drop rapidly, so the two had no choice but to follow.

Moreover, even though they were both women, they didn't want to show themselves in such an embarrassing state.

The place Armin led them to was a shop that combined a restaurant and inn.

Before entering the building, Amy checked the name on the sign. It was similar to the Tormia language but subtly different, making it impossible to understand the meaning.

"Welcome."

When they opened the door and entered, a woman in her 40s who had been knitting at the counter gave a formal greeting.

When looking at the building from outside, it seemed too narrow, but once inside, it had a structure that extended deep inward.

The hall was about 7 pyeong, with three tables where one could drink alcohol. Hunters sat in the corner, warming themselves with hot liquor.

Past the hall, around the corner, there was a corridor extending deep inside, where the floor had been torn up to place a furnace. Whether drainage was installed or not, rainwater didn't come in this far.

Around it were square tables where one could eat, and people dressed as travelers were eating.

Armin first offered the women empty seats and sat across the table from them.

Then a musician wearing a pointed hat who had been warming himself near the furnace began tuning a four-stringed instrument.

Inns frequented by travelers hire musicians under contract to play music when a certain number of people gather.

Also, even when the required number isn't met, they'll perform if given money personally.

The musician played his instrument with a sorrowful tone and sang.

It was a song about a knight who lost his beloved and set out on a journey to find a place to die. The melody was gentle, but the lyrics were quite sad.

Reina was surprised to realize that the musician's performance was of professional quality. However, it was a variation that departed from the basics of harmony. It felt like several songs mixed into one.

But the other travelers didn't seem to care. No, they didn't seem to care about anything. The fact that they didn't even glance at the two women with their figures revealed was proof of this.

Amy found it strange. Of course, it wasn't that men had to look at her when she showed her figure, but it was still an odd situation.

Looking closely, they weren't actually eating. Their forks were meaninglessly traveling back and forth between the food and their mouths.

The reason it seemed like they were eating was because they kept muttering something with depressed expressions.

Unreadable signs. Strange songs with jarring melodies. People who weren't eating. And depressed expressions.

Amy suddenly got goosebumps. She finally realized that this place was different from any world she knew.

"Where exactly is this place?"

Armin nodded as if he had been waiting for that question to come up.

"This is Sirone's consciousness. I looked around before you came, and it seems to be the 11th level among the 12 levels of human mentality—that is, the surface psychology."

She had heard from Arin when they went to Galliant that human mentality was divided into 12 levels.

But that wasn't the problem now. The problem was that she had entered that place.

Reina, feeling the same way, asked back.

"So you're saying this place right now is Sirone's consciousness?"

Armin nodded instead of elaborating.

To explain such a strange world, it was more effective to simply make them believe rather than persuade them.

Amy saw through Armin's intention and suppressed her curiosity.

Let's believe it for now. Wherever this was, what mattered more was finding a way to save Sirone.

"We need to chase Arius. And in a little while, Sirone's neck will be cut in reality."

Armin smiled and shook his head.

"There's quite a difference between real time and consciousness time. You followed me right away, didn't you? But I've been waiting here for over 30 minutes."

Amy calculated intuitively.

Although there was a slight time difference, she had entered this place almost simultaneously with Armin. Yet if there was a 30-minute difference, she had to consider that time moved incredibly slowly compared to reality.

'No, it would be more accurate to say that the speed of consciousness is fast.'

Armin continued.

"Sirone will be fine for a while. I would have liked to slow down time even more if possible, but even time barriers have their limits..."

Currently, Armin had Keira bound with the time barrier of Stop magic 14 kilometers away from Kasula's royal castle, so he didn't have many spare time lines.

If he had used the Slow magic that ordinary mages use, he could have delayed time much more extremely, but that wouldn't have been a wise choice in that situation.

Slow is an active magic.

If he filled the omniscience slot that most mages have only one of with Slow, he would hand over the initiative to Arius, who was also a Scale mage. Moreover, he wasn't an easy enough opponent to fight while time-splitting.

That's why he used the time barrier, a passive skill.

The time barrier, which simultaneously occupies time and space, continues to be effective in space even after activation, essentially leaving one omniscience slot free to flexibly respond to the opponent's reactions.

The reason Arius didn't rashly make any moves during the standoff was because he had grasped this fact.

Thanks to this, Sirone avoided instant death, but Armin's time line was down to just its tail. Even though he could create barriers indefinitely, if their effectiveness dropped, it would be worse than having none.

'The only thing left is Flicker. I have no choice but to try with this.'

The reason Armin waited for the two women was also because the 11th level consciousness state they entered was serious.

He didn't want to put Sirone's friends in danger, but if they came in voluntarily, he thought he would have no choice but to accept their help.

"Of course, we're not completely at ease. We need to find Sirone as quickly as possible. But unfortunately, I've almost completely lost my combat ability. That's why I need your help. First, let me tell you the information you absolutely need to know."

Reina took a listening posture and said.

"Yes, we want to help. So please tell us. Why is Zion trying to kill Sirone by bribing even an assassin and Arius? Especially since I know Arius is Orcamp's person."

"To talk about that, I'll first need to talk about Arius. His nickname is Grave Robber, and he's quite famous in the Black Line as one of the Seven Deadly Sins."

At the mention of Black Line, Amy frowned.

There were criminals in Red Line too, but they were still people who raised their rank through notoriety and achievements.

Arcane was an example.

On the other hand, Black Line was far from honor. They pursued only their own pleasure, and for that pleasure, they didn't care if society collapsed.

"You're saying such a person has been next to Orcamp all this time?"

"His skills are certain. As an Unlocker and Scale mage, he mainly makes a living by infiltrating people's minds and stealing thoughts. He's the one who installed the door in Sirone's surface psychology. He probably dove at least once without Sirone knowing."

Amy tapped the table. It made a tapping sound.

"Are you really saying everything in this inn is Sirone's consciousness?"

"Yes. Although they look like objects, they're actually landscapes created by Sirone's mental workings."

Reina asked.

"What kind of principle is that? Can human thoughts manifest as such a concrete world?"

"All the mentality that humans acquire while being born and growing up becomes objectified. Love, anger, lukewarmness—they're all objects. You could interpret them as language, but since this is a world connected to the unconscious, objectification would be the right expression."

Arius looked around the inn's scenery and continued.

"Then why does the arrangement of objects in this mental world resemble reality so closely? It's because all objects in the 11th level come up through the 6th level REM domain. If the unconscious were projected directly here, it would be a completely chaotic world."

Amy stroked her chin and said.

"Hmm. So you're saying human mentality goes through a filter called REM, gets converted into objects, then comes up here?"

"Exactly. Since REM is a mental state during sleep, it's easy to understand if you think of it as dreams. Dreams are the boundary line that divides consciousness and unconsciousness. That's why two characteristics appear simultaneously in dreams. The higher you go from the 6th level, the stronger consciousness becomes, and the lower you go, the stronger unconsciousness becomes."

Arius pointed at the ceiling.

"This is the 11th level surface psychology, the highest floor except for the shell layer. Therefore, it's a very objectified world. Realistic, complex, and extensive."

The musician's sorrowful melody played softly.

The variations were still a mess, but thinking that this too had gone through the filter of dreams made the eeriness disappear.

Reina said.

"You said Arius is a grave robber. What is he trying to steal from Sirone's mind?"

Amy answered.

"Ataraxia."
