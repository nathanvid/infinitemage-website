Armin nodded his head.

"That's right. The reason Sirone was invited to Kasula's royal castle is because he possesses the abilities of an archangel."

"I knew it. Those bastards! They weren't simply trying to find their biological son."

Since Reina didn't know about Heaven, she couldn't understand what the two were saying, but she remained silent for now. It wouldn't be too late to fill in the missing pieces after hearing the whole story.

Amy suddenly raised her hand.

"Wait. But why did they try to kill Sirone? If Sirone dies, wouldn't Ataraxia disappear too?"

Armin pressed his lips tightly together. It was a sharp observation. But since he had decided to seek their help, he thought he shouldn't lie and spoke honestly.

"There's a reason for that. It was probably Arius's idea to kill Sirone. Actually, he probably didn't have such intentions at first. He simply planned to infiltrate Sirone's mind and copy Ataraxia. But he failed."

"Why? Is copying difficult?"

"There would be various factors, but in my opinion, Ataraxia isn't an ability humans can handle. If you forcibly install it at some point in consciousness, you could go insane. That's why the original owner seems to have engraved it in a very deep place."

"By deep place, you mean?"

Armin raised his index finger.

"The first level. It's probably in the primordial consciousness that governs instinct. If you implant it in the realm of instinct, even the most bizarre concept will be naturally accepted as if it had been there from the beginning."

Amy nodded. Now things were finally starting to make sense.

Armin continued speaking.

"Instinct is a safe space for the person themselves, but a terrible place for others. However, with Arius's skills, he could probably dive down to the primordial consciousness for a short while. And it seems he tried it. Judging by the door that's been installed."

"But he still failed at grave robbing?"

"That's the only way to think about it. It's probably protected by a cryptographic system that humans can't solve, or it's likely engraved in the form of a capsule that even Sirone can't see inside. That's why he decided to kill Sirone. The reason you can't carelessly enter the primordial consciousness is because the deeper you go, the stronger the defensive instincts become. Once the unconscious security system activates, even the world's greatest diver would drown without being able to escape."

"Now I understand. That's why they targeted Sirone's neck..."

"Exactly. Human unconsciousness extends roots deep into the body. Therefore, if the neck is severed, the unconscious defense mechanisms collapse. Arius was targeting that opportunity."

Amy bit her lip and fell into thought. There was still one thing she couldn't understand.

"Um, something doesn't seem right. Even if Arius collapses the unconscious and reaches the first level, what can he do there? If it's not an ability humans can handle, even if he copies it, he won't be able to use it, right? And there's no way to engrave it into instinct like Sirone."

Armin felt that what he'd been dreading had come. From here on was a story that absolutely must not be revealed to the outside world.

'I really didn't want to reveal this...'

But without their help, he couldn't save Sirone. To improve mission performance even a little, they needed to understand this world.

"What you're about to hear is classified information with the highest security level, regardless of which nation. Of course, there's no such thing as a real secret, but anyway, I'll tell you."

The two women nodded. Yet they couldn't promise not to reveal it because they understood Armin's last words.

"Human consciousness... can be transformed into objects."

Amy blinked. At first, it didn't intuitively register, and compared to what she'd been eagerly expecting, it seemed bland.

But gradually, as Armin's words sank into her mind, she realized how absurd it sounded.

"So you're saying consciousness becomes objects?"

Armin delayed his answer and asked an unexpected question.

"Have you ever heard the word 'Drimo'?"

Reina shook her head first, followed by Amy showing the same reaction.

Armin continued as if it were natural.

"Drimo is a multidimensional mental world. The human brain consumes energy to think. So then, is thought energy? Some people believe energy is merely for operating the brain, and thought is another concept entirely. They think it's a product created by energy. And that product must be discharged somewhere. That's the space called dreams."

"It's similar to the law of conservation of mass."

"Correct. Drimo is a space you can enter in dreams if you meet certain conditions. You could call it an imagination complex where all thoughts gather. Then a tremendous hypothesis emerges. If thoughts escape to Drimo, then conversely, you should be able to bring thoughts from Drimo into reality."

Amy asked with a dazed expression.

"Are there actually people who have gone to Drimo?"

"Why wouldn't there be? No, there are countless people. They enter through dreams and then cleverly use the rules of equivalent exchange to smuggle things. However, concepts that don't contain powerful desires are said to be difficult to smuggle. Anyway, Arius steals thoughts in that manner."

"Wait. That means objects that came over from Drimo already exist. Then what exactly are those..."

Amy's eyes widened as she realized something.

"Could it be, those objects are..."

Arius smiled bitterly as he spoke.

"That's right. We call them Objet."

Amy understood why Armin had been so threatening. It was evidence that shattered the existing hypothesis that thoughts were merely energy.

"Literally, Objet are human consciousness materialized. That's why Objet abilities are based on extremely private desires. Of course, there's nothing strange about that in thoughts. The problem is when it manifests in reality."

Reina spoke.

"I know about Objet too. According to a mage acquaintance, they're objects that violate the laws of the universe. But hearing this now, it seems they didn't know properly either."

Armin agreed.

"They wouldn't. Even among high-ranking officials, even royalty, very few people know about Drimo. Probably except for the king, it would be top secret outside of specialized departments. Objet may seem to ignore causality, but if you accept the hypothesis that thoughts are a type of matter, they don't violate universal laws. However, there's still much unknown about the interaction between reality and Drimo."

Reina said.

"Like 'The Last Cry of the Jaeger Family'."

"Oh, you knew about that?"

Reina blushed and shook her head.

"No. I only know it's called that. I went as a performer to a royal gathering, and I have good hearing so I pick up a lot. Sorry. It just came up because I knew about it..."

Armin smiled as if it were fine and told them the story about 'The Last Cry of the Jaeger Family'. Amy, who had been listening with interest, shuddered at the final incident.

"Did that really happen?"

"It was a real incident. However, opinions are divided on whether it was the family head's psychotic behavior or a phenomenon to balance dimensions. What's certain is that they experienced something impossible and an Objet remained in that place. Perhaps someone from the family made contact with Drimo. I can't reveal the conditions for going to Drimo, but the probability of entering by coincidence isn't completely zero."

Amy was curious about those conditions but kept quiet, thinking it wouldn't be polite to pry further.

"Anyway, the relationship between Drimo and reality isn't something humans can predict. That's why each nation recognizes approaching Drimo as a serious crime. Actually, Dive magic itself isn't so bad. It's used for treating mental patients. You need a formal diver license. But Arius is abusing it. That's why he's called a grave robber rather than a diver. Accessing Drimo is taboo regardless of nation. That's why Arius is pursued worldwide as a double-S class criminal."

Reina made a disgusted expression.

"In a way... we're dealing with quite a formidable person."

Armin acknowledged it wouldn't be easy.

"Actually, if he didn't commit crimes, he could truly be called a brilliant intellectual. Diving requires tremendous intellectual ability."

Amy organized the content she'd heard so far.

"Let me summarize. Arius is after Ataraxia. He planned murder to collapse Sirone's unconscious and is currently heading to the first level. He'll steal Ataraxia from there and go to Drimo. Then he'll smuggle it into reality through equivalent exchange. If that happens...?"

Amy got chills just from imagining it. This was also the reason Armin had come here, even binding Kaira with Stop magic.

"That's right. Ataraxia becomes an Objet. The archangel's ability becomes a tool anyone can use. This is truly serious."

"..."

Faced with a reality they didn't want to accept, the two women fell silent and lost themselves in thought.

Being trapped in a time barrier doesn't mean becoming stupid.

The acceleration of thoughts, emotions, and cognition remain the same - only the speed at which they unfold has slowed.

Therefore, Sirone was still impulsive, and that impulse was developing into an even more intense impulse within the slow flow of time.

Similarly, Zenogger's wire was also boring into Sirone's neck, containing powerful energy in slow time.

The sound of flesh tearing spread slowly, and even more slowly... the crack carved into Sirone's neck was being stained with blood.

@

Flash!

The outside of the window was suddenly dyed golden.

Rumble! Crash! Bang! Bang!

Thunder loud enough to shake heaven and earth rocked the world.

Amy looked out the window with a terrified expression. It was violent natural phenomena difficult to hear even in reality.

She thought she was past the age of being frightened by thunder, but hearing the explosive roar of the heavens, primal human fear gripped her heart.

"It's really tremendous. It sounds like thunder is striking right in front of us."

Armin said while looking outside.

"The fear of death that the unconscious is experiencing has risen to the surface layer. But this level is quite good. If an ordinary person were in this situation, it would have been chaos long ago. It's because it's Sirone that he's enduring."

Amy smiled sadly. Unlike herself who had been scolded earlier, Armin recognized Sirone.

What would it feel like to be recognized by such an amazing mage? That's why it was sad that Sirone wasn't here.

'Well, all of this is because it's Sirone...'

Armin was wary of getting caught up in sentiment.

"Even now, the wire is strangling Sirone's neck. It will get worse and worse, and collapse will begin from below. You can tell the aftermath by looking at the current state of the 11th level. Eventually, the minimum conditions for Arius to dive into the deep sea will be met."

Amy quickly regained her sense of reality.

"Isn't there a way? A way to save Sirone?"

Stopping Arius and Zion wouldn't be the end of it. If the time barrier was released like this, Sirone would die immediately.

"Currently, there's only one method. We also have to penetrate through the REM zone and burrow down to the deep layers. It's already too late to reverse something in reality. But if we plant something at the bottom of consciousness, it might be possible."

Everything happening in Sirone's consciousness immediately becomes Sirone's. Therefore, the idea was to plant a method of response in the unconscious beforehand for this life-or-death crisis.

"Like Ataraxia, planting magic?"

Armin scratched his head.

"That's impossible. Actually, I don't know how Sirone came to possess that magic either. There must have been something unique to the archangel. But it's impossible for us. However, if we go deep enough, we might be able to engrave something like simple behavioral guidelines."
