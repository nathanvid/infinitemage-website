Reina spoke.

"Action instructions. Will that be enough?"

Sirone's neck was already caught in the wire. Planting thoughts to trigger certain actions didn't seem like it would improve the situation.

"For now, we have no choice but to try. The truth is, we don't have much leeway. Of course, decapitation would take considerable time, but if even the arteries are severed, it would be fatal. By that time, his unconscious would probably collapse at tremendous speed."

Amy became anxious.

"Then what do we do?"

Armin's proposed solution was simple.

"We need to find Sirone."

"What? But this is Sirone's mind, isn't it?"

"To be precise, everything here are shadows created by projecting Sirone's core. We're going to find the core, not the shadows. It's called an avatar."

Amy recalled what she had heard from Gardlock in the Valley of the Whirlpool Serpent. The whirlpool serpent, which had been the shadow of a giant snake, was actually just a smooth, small salamander. The people of heaven called it an avatar.

"Would that avatar be on the 11th level surface?"

Armin shook his head.

"It won't be there. So we'll have to call it up."

Reina asked.

"How do we call it?"

Before hearing Armin's answer, Amy figured it out.

"We can ask people, can't we? After all, everyone here is Sirone."

Armin nodded satisfactorily. It seemed the two of them were now intuitively understanding the nature of this world to some degree.

"Correct. We ask people. It's called a keyword. While it's quite difficult work on the outside, here we just need to ask. If we inject Sirone as a keyword, the avatar will rise up to the 11th level. Now, let's get going."

Armin led the two women to the counter and asked the middle-aged woman who was still knitting.

"Do you happen to know someone named Sirone?"

The moment Armin finished speaking, the musician's performance stopped as if by magic. The people's murmuring could no longer be heard either.

Only when the sound disappeared did they realize how much noise they had been exposed to. It was perfectly quiet.

Amy looked around with an eerie feeling.

The people who had been immersed in melancholy until now opened their eyes clearly and were looking at Armin.

The woman at the counter was the same. She, who hadn't even blinked as if frozen, belatedly opened her mouth.

"Why are you looking for that person?"

Armin smiled with a "hmm."

That person. Seeing that she didn't say Sirone's name showed his cautious consciousness.

In any case, they had to speak carefully from now on. They couldn't be too obvious, and hostile remarks were also forbidden.

"I have something urgent to tell him."

The woman thought for a moment, then continued knitting.

"I don't know. I don't know who such a person is."

"I see."

Arius thought this wouldn't be easy and let out a "whew."

Indeed, he was well-trained. Even a mage specialized in mental realms would normally waver when facing decapitation.

The fact that fragments of consciousness still maintained their wariness despite thunder and chaos outside showed how well he had usually disciplined his mind.

"Understood. Then we'll be going."

The woman at the counter said without even looking up.

"Pay the roof fee before you go."

It seemed she wouldn't be satisfied unless she collected what was due, even on the brink of death. This too was the mind of a mage pursuing 100 percent efficiency.

'Hehe, what a thorough personality.'

It was customary for people who entered an inn to escape the rain without lodging to pay a roof fee.

But Amy had no money. Even if she had some, it was questionable whether real-world money would work in transactions here.

Then Armin rummaged through his pocket and readily took out a gold coin to pay.

"Here it is."

"Huh?"

Amy examined the gold coin he handed over. As expected, it was a gear-shaped gold coin not used in reality.

The woman at the counter frowned as she touched the gold coin.

"This is too expensive."

"The change is fine."

"I can't do that. It's fine, so just take it."

"It's really okay."

When Armin refused with a smile, the woman coolly accepted.

"Alright then. You'll be blessed."

Amy pouted her lips.

The inn owner had different speech, appearance, and gender, but somehow reminded her of Sirone's usual demeanor.

"Well, let's go outside first."

Armin already had a serious expression.

They left the inn but didn't dare go beyond the eaves. Water was rising on the ground like a flood.

Amy, feeling the chill again, shivered.

"At this rate, the whole world will be submerged."

Armin shook his head.

"No, the world will disappear before that."

Amy turned her head to look at the inn's scene.

The warmth blocked by a single window made her feel colder, but watching the people resting comfortably warmed her heart.

If Sirone died, all of them would disappear.

Though they weren't people, she hoped they could live long in this world.

"First, we've injected the Sirone keyword, so Sirone's avatar will surface. Divers call this process the net."

"I see."

"But that's where the problem lies. Since we don't have time, I'll explain as we go. If the water rises more, it'll be hard to move."

Armin ran through the torrential rain where you couldn't see an inch ahead. Amy caught up beside him and asked.

"Where are we going? We don't even know where Sirone is."

"First... we'll probably need to buy weapons. Probably."

Armin stopped in front of a two-story building and looked up. He could see a sign with crossed axes and swords.

The three people took shelter from the rain under the weapon shop's eaves. This time the eaves were narrow, so they had to stick to the wall.

Armin looked at the two women standing side by side and asked.

"Do you know how to handle anything?"

Reina spoke first.

"I learned a little swordsmanship as a child..."

"I'm a mage."

When Amy said this somewhat embarrassedly, Arius smiled. Having been scolded earlier, she seemed ashamed to proudly call herself a mage.

"I see. It would be good if there's something useful."

When Armin tried to enter the weapon shop, Amy hurriedly stopped him.

"Wait, but what about money?"

Even if there were good weapons, they couldn't buy them without money. Moreover, the money paid at the inn wasn't real-world money.

Since Armin hadn't been in Sirone's consciousness for long either, she thought maybe she could also obtain money somehow.

"Ah, that was withdrawn."

"Withdrawn? From where?"

Armin pointed to the sky.

"From Sirone, of course. This is Sirone's consciousness, so you can create anything you want. Try thinking that you need money. Then money will come in according to how much Sirone trusts you. Let's see..."

Armin rummaged through his pocket and took out gold coins.

"I currently have 9, so I received a total of 10 gold. If this is gold, that is, haha."

Seeing the gear-shaped gold coins in Armin's palm, the two women thought they needed money.

Reina, who searched her pocket, showed delight.

"Oh? It's true. Seven, seven gold."

Amy looked on in surprise.

Since she had never heard of someone named Armin during all her time knowing Sirone, she thought Reina would receive at least more than 10 gold coins.

But the result defied expectations - Armin won.

Could it be that Sirone actually looked down on Reina? No, rather it meant he trusted Armin that much.

'Who is this person anyway? What kind of relationship did he have with Sirone?'

In any case, Amy felt some anticipation too. Though it was something unusable in reality, this was the only currency in the mental world.

'Hmm, Mr. Armin got 10, Sister Reina got 7. Then maybe I'll get about 20?'

Amy stuck out her tongue and rummaged through her pocket. Then she switched hands to search the opposite pocket.

Gradually, her expression worsened.

"Huh?"

Reina tilted her head and asked.

"What's wrong?"

"No, wait a minute."

Amy frantically searched all the pockets in her clothes. But no matter how much she looked, no withdrawal occurred.

Amy's face reddened as she said incredulously.

"There are no gold coins coming in."

Armin nodded as if he understood the reason.

"Hmm, I see. If Sirone refuses the withdrawal, that's certainly possible."

Amy was shocked.

The number of gold coins was supposed to indicate how much Sirone trusted that person. But how could she not receive even one?

"No, no, let me try again."

Armin said as if it was useless.

"No point in trying. Since we don't have time, let's get something with the money we have."

Gold coin withdrawal was a very easy task. If gold coins didn't come out once, it would be the same no matter how many times you tried.

Reina comforted Amy and led her toward the weapon shop.

"Come on, Amy, let's do that. About 16 gold should be enough."

Amy shook off Reina's arm, stopped in place, and shouted.

"That can't be right!"

Tears welled up in Amy's eyes.

The 7 gold that Reina received represented Sirone's feelings toward her. She didn't want to buy her weapon with that. If she had to buy something, it should be with money that Sirone gave to her.

Armin fully understood that feeling. This was also why excavation was prohibited worldwide.

When you get to know a person's inner self nakedly, you inevitably feel that everything you originally knew was false.

Even though that was actually human nature.

"Miss Amy, you don't need to feel betrayed. Sirone is desperately holding on. Any emotional disturbance can cause that. Did you perhaps convey some bad feelings to him before coming here..."

Amy shook her head roughly.

"No, that can't be. I..."

Amy cut off her words.

Honestly, how could she know? Even if she knew everything about Sirone, she couldn't grasp his inner thoughts.

Maybe it was because she couldn't properly respond to Zenogger's attack. She had hoped he would melt the spider webs with Ignite to save her, but he might be disappointed in her inability to handle it properly.

Arius sighed. It was something everyone had to go through in Sirone's consciousness anyway, and it wasn't a problem with a clear answer.

"Let's go in. We can't delay any longer."

When Armin firmly cut off the discussion, Amy had no choice but to follow. Seeing her dejected appearance, Reina felt sorry but knew no comfort was possible in this situation.

"Welcome."

The shop owner folded his newspaper and greeted them.

Amy slightly raised her head and widened her eyes. He looked a bit older, but it was definitely Nade.

"Nade? How are you here?"

"Huh? You know me? I'm seeing you for the first time."

Amy looked at Armin with eyes demanding explanation. Armin was also acquainted with Nade. He was one of Sirone's friends who had once hidden in his house.

"It's Sirone's projection. The object of a weapon shop and the object of Nade have been combined. It seems this boy Nade has interest in this area."

Reina said.

"Sometimes it happens in dreams too. You fight thinking someone's a villain, but when you wake up from the dream, it turns out that person was actually family you argued with the night before."

"Yes. It's a natural mental process. And the fact that there's a complex projection means a more impressive concept exists here than in other places. Shall we look around?"

Nade stared at Amy intently, frowning.

"I really don't know. Didn't you mistake me for someone else?"

"Ah, I guess so. The person I know is much younger. Sorry."

"Hahaha! I do get told I look young for my age a lot."

Amy pretended not to know to avoid stimulating Sirone's mind with unnecessary words. Human consciousness was so complex that even touching minor parts could immediately cause a butterfly effect.
