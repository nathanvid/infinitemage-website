Amy, who had been hurt by Shirone not giving her the gold coins, felt somewhat better upon unexpectedly seeing a friend from school and spoke up.

"I'd like to look at some weapons. Is it okay if I browse around?"

Nade smiled warmly and encouraged her shopping.

"Sure, go ahead. We have all sorts of things, so take a look around. By the way, you're all getting around well even in this weather. I was feeling down and thinking about closing early. The rain's making me suddenly depressed."

Amy put her hands behind her back and browsed through the various weapons.

The basic equipment was fairly well-stocked. Most fortunately, there were no mage equipment pieces.

If there had been magical items, it would have been ridiculous to insist on not buying them with someone else's money, so she felt rather relieved.

After casually looking around at the displayed items, Amy discovered a weapon hanging on the wall, enclosed in a glass case.

"Huh? What's this?"

The paper below the case read "First Thunder Strike."

Nade's face lit up as he spoke.

"Ah, that's the pride of our shop! It's a weapon that makes thunder sounds when you swing it. Amazing, right? I experimented with it before, and the impact is tremendous. Any monster would be so startled it'd run away!"

On the carriage heading to Galliant, she had heard Rian tell stories about Shirone's childhood.

He had successfully performed Thunder Strike at age twelve - it must have been such a precious memory.

Amy looked at the price tag. Then she raised her eyebrows in disbelief.

"5.9 billion gold?"

"Hahaha! Of course! It's the pride of our shop, after all! That's what it takes to get something like this."

Armin approached from behind Amy.

"Probably no one could buy this through normal means. I don't know how this world's economy works, but even if Reina and I combined all our money, we'd only have 17 gold at most. Even our parents couldn't withdraw 5.9 billion gold."

Amy understood. But somehow feeling reluctant to give up, she stroked her chin and asked.

"Hmm, what if a grave robber tried to steal this?"

"It would probably be possible. Since it's an object filled with Shirone's intense thoughts, it would be easy to convert into an Objet. They could gather the money illegally or steal it. But if I were a grave robber, I wouldn't steal this."

"Because there's no particular need for it."

Armin nodded in agreement.

"Right. The more an Objet breaks common sense, the more valuable it is. Simply having thunder sounds come from an axe isn't that unusual. It's just a matter of successfully performing Thunder Strike. Most items at the 11th level would probably be like this. Since this is the surface layer, there's no room for humans' intimate desires to be revealed. Therefore, 'First Thunder Strike' should be interpreted as a precious memory rather than a desire."

Amy understood the nature of Objets. And she realized just how terrible a person Arius was.

This world belonged to Shirone. No matter what others thought, it was his most precious psyche. Arius, who would even commit murder to grave rob it, had to be arrested.

Armin walked to the window and looked outside while speaking.

"Anyway, as law-abiding citizens, we don't need to be greedy. If we're not going to grave rob, these are just dream objects anyway. No need to be picky about choosing. Just arm yourselves enough for minimal self-defense."

Amy tilted her head questioningly.

"For self-defense? Aren't we choosing these to face Zion and Arius? For that, even perfect armament wouldn't be enough."

Armin remained by the window as he spoke.

"I'll explain that once we're outside. For now, just choose."

Reina rested her chin on her hand, lost in thought.

The Ozent family was a household that revered swords. Moreover, the sword was the weapon she was most confident with.

"By any chance, do you sell bows here?"

A smile spread across Armin's lips.

"Good choice."

Currently, outside was so dark you couldn't distinguish anything. In that case, ranged weapons would be more useful than close-combat weapons. Especially with her hearing, the bow's accuracy would be high.

Reina examined the bow Nade had selected for her. The tension was firm and the curve of the bow's back wasn't twisted.

When learning martial arts, she had been taught that bows were weapons that could create variables. Also, befitting a martial arts family, they often went hunting, so her fundamentals were solid.

"I like it. I'll take this one. I'll buy a quiver and arrows too."

"Great. I'll give you good quality ones. Wait a moment."

While Nade searched for items in the storage behind the counter, Reina turned to Amy and asked.

"There are no magic weapons. Should we try another place?"

"It's fine. Tools aren't particularly important for mages."

Amy summoned Jack O'Lantern beside her face.

"Besides, I have the weapon Shirone bought for me."

Amy regretted her words as soon as she spoke them. Emphasizing that Shirone had bought it for her only made her feel more miserable.

But since it was already spilled milk, she pretended not to notice and turned away.

Armin leaned against the window and crossed his arms.

'Jack O'Lantern. That's ancient magic. She's obtained quite a difficult item to acquire.'

Having been to Heaven on some mission, Armin knew the approximate market rates of the community.

Ancient magic could be obtained with elixirs, and something like Jack O'Lantern would require at least a White Elixir.

Shirone and Amy must be quite close friends.

Yet the withdrawal wasn't working. Plus that last comment revealing resentment toward Shirone.

'Hmm, so that's how it is.'

This could be dangerous. No, in the mental world, this was precisely the greatest obstacle.

'I'd better give advance warning.'

Just as Armin made his decision, Nade returned with two 20-piece arrow quivers. When asked how much everything cost, he said 4 gold.

Amy approached Armin and whispered.

"Isn't this too expensive? One bow set costs half of your credibility value."

"It is expensive. But that means it's probably top quality. Maybe it even has additional abilities. The 'owner of this world' isn't the type to rip people off. Of course, this boy Nade might usually be a con artist, but judging by how he was entrusted with 'First Thunder Strike,' he seems to be a friendly projection."

The reason Armin referred to Shirone as 'the owner of this world' in a roundabout way was because Nade was listening.

Having experienced at the inn how sensitive projections were to keywords, Amy immediately understood and nodded.

"Right. Nade isn't the type to carelessly hand over low-quality items."

Reina paid the 4 gold. Once they met the owner of this world, money wouldn't be necessary anyway.

Reina strapped one quiver to her back and one to her thigh. Then she held three arrows between her fingers and placed them on the bowstring, completing her preparations.

Amy also floated Jack O'Lantern and turned to look at Armin.

Though they were only two people, their hearts were no different from an army preparing to advance.

"Are you ready? From now on, we're going to meet 'the owner of this world.'"

Reina asked.

"But where do we start looking?"

"We don't need to go far. He's everywhere anyway."

Armin looked up toward where Nade was. Amy and Reina stepped aside to clear a path.

"Do you know where Shirone is?"

Amy was startled.

Nothing major had happened, but she didn't want to experience the situation where everyone's attention was focused on them like at the inn ever again.

As expected, Nade stared at Armin without even blinking. But perhaps because he was a complex projection, he didn't stick to playing dumb like the inn owner had.

"Why are you looking for Shirone?"

Armin's lips curved upward. Indeed, this weapon shop was a place where Shirone's consciousness was considerably concentrated.

'Then I can't let this opportunity slip by.'

Armin cranked up the intensity of his keywords.

"Shirone is going to die soon. We're trying to help him before that happens."

Amy swallowed nervously and waited for Nade's reaction. How would Shirone's consciousness receive Armin's words?

Nade stared at Armin with an emotionless face. Then, in a completely different voice from what they'd heard initially, he warned.

"Leave. This place is not your world."

Realizing he had connected with Shirone's avatar, Arius pressed on.

"Is that a refusal? Shirone, think again. You need to accept our help. Tell us where you are."

Strange symptoms occurred in Nade's body as he maintained his silence. His pupils disappeared and became like black caves, then his entire body began to turn black.

"Tch! A failure?"

Armin quickly retreated.

"What is it? What on earth is happening?"

"This is where it begins! Get outside!"

As Armin pushed the door open with his shoulder, Reina followed with her bow loaded. Amy looked back one last time.

The Nade she knew was gone, and a black shadow form was rapidly flying toward them. Her heart nearly dropped in shock as she left the shop, only to see the same things swarming from all directions.

Amy immediately cast Shining magic. As light burst forth, the falling raindrops became clearly visible.

Inside the curtain of falling water stood the shadows.

They had human shapes but elongated waists and long arms.

Most bizarre were their faces. Like whirlpools being sucked into an abyss, thin lines of light spiraled around.

"Armin. What exactly are those..."

"Egoists."

Amy turned her head slightly and asked back.

"Egoists?"

"Don't be fooled by their appearance. Their forms are ever-changing."

"Shiiiiiii!"

As an Egoist attacked, Armin cast Flicker to escape the encirclement. People rushed out of buildings and immediately transformed to pursue him.

Armin cast Flicker consecutively. The forms disappeared, leaving only flickering shockwaves crossing through space, revealing his trajectory.

Meanwhile, Reina, having finished her battle preparations, held three arrows between her fingers and shot them in rapid succession.

The Egoist's body exploded with a pop and collapsed to the ground. It was certainly a phenomenon that couldn't occur in reality.

When one individual was hit, the Egoists immediately sought countermeasures. When Reina shot arrows, they twisted their waists thin like thread to dodge. But this time Amy's Fire Strike burned through their heads.

Even while burning, the Egoists endlessly continued their attacks. Contrary to expectations that they would be physically fragile, their strength was considerable. Compared to real monsters, they seemed to be at least 3rd tier.

Reina gradually became accustomed to the bow. Ignoring the sound of rain, she tracked the enemies' sounds and made predictive shots, causing the arrows to seemingly curve as they struck the Egoists.

"Shiiiiiii!"

While the Armin and Reina combo was active, Amy was separately dealing with one Egoist. It was the strongest individual in the group - the Egoist that Nade from the weapon shop had transformed into.

Nade's Egoist changed its form to suit tactics and pressed Amy. Its arms stretched into four, stabbing like awls, then it extended its waist like a mollusk and dodged Amy's rapid-fire Fire Strikes as if dancing.

The number of Egoists swarming to this location increased further, with shadows rippling everywhere. Since Armin's Flicker magic was useless once he left the battlefield, they couldn't drag this out any longer.

Amy cast Fire Wall to separate the enemy and allied forces. As she concentrated, the wall of fire rose twice as high, burning the Egoists standing on the line.

Nade's Egoist looked back at that spot, then stopped attacking and stared intently at Amy. Amy recalled hearing Shirone's voice in the shop and shouted.

"Shirone! It's me! Amy!"

The Egoist didn't respond. But it had clearly understood her words. Its head tilted slightly about 45 degrees.
