"We came to rescue you! Where are you right now?"

"Shiiiiiiiii!"

Nade bent all four of his arms and let out a roar toward the sky.

At that moment, all the Egoists stopped moving.

Amy held her breath and watched the situation unfold. Her heart pounded at the thought that her voice might have reached Shirone.

But what followed was devastating. The Egoists stretched out as if being sucked into something, then shot upward against the falling rain.

From high in the sky, they began forming parabolic arcs as they were absorbed into Nade's Egoist.

The form of the Egoist that had absorbed its companions began changing rapidly. Its bulk grew to over three meters, and insect legs protruded from its shoulders, sides, and waist.

Its tail swelled like a bee's abdomen, and its face grotesquely stretched back and forth like a curved sausage. The facial area split open as if cleaved by a knife, revealing saw-like teeth, while a long tongue emerged from deep in its throat, undulating like waves.

"Kieeeeeee!"

Amy's face turned deathly pale. She couldn't possibly think of that thing as Shirone. The form created by all the Egoists in the vicinity gathering together was horrifying beyond measure.

When the monstrosity stepped forward, the ground shook with a thud. That thing couldn't be defeated. Even while holding that conviction, she fought to keep her confused mind together and took a fighting stance.

If she retreated at just the 11th level, Shirone couldn't be saved. Even if it meant dying here, she intended to fight.

"Alright, here we go!"

"Well done! Now let's run!"

As Armin passed by her side with those words, Amy looked back at him retreating with a bewildered expression. But she immediately canceled her magic and broke into a run. Reina followed close behind.

The three of them ran with all their strength. In the distance, the Egoist's screams echoed through the rain.

Armin took refuge in a secluded alley, leaning his back against the wall and slumping down. Amy and Reina also sat across from him, tilting their heads up and breathing heavily. Raindrops drummed on their faces like a shower.

Before Amy could catch her breath, she asked:

"What on earth was that? It's Shirone's consciousness, so how could such a monster appear?"

"It's the selfish defense mechanism that humans possess. It's mixed in with the projections. The more powerful the projection, the stronger the Egoist becomes."

Amy recalled that Nade had been the strongest.

"But is it okay for us to run away like this?"

"When the ego is attacked, the Egoist uses nearby projections to manifest itself. But when it becomes terrorized like now, the Egoist's nature disappears, so it can't track our location. It's incredibly strong, and there's no benefit to eliminating it, so running away is better."

Reina placed her elbows on her knees and covered her face. Steam rose from her body from how much they had run.

"Phew, is it because we failed to inject the keyword?"

"It's not that we failed, but that Shirone rejected it. He's quite guarded. Of course, given the current situation in reality, that's unavoidable."

Amy asked:

"Do we have to keep fighting things like that?"

"For now, it's the only way. We have to keep injecting keywords until Shirone accepts them. There's no way to descend to the 1st level without Shirone's guidance."

"But those things are still part of Shirone's consciousness, aren't they? Couldn't we persuade them?"

Arius shook his head coldly.

"Egoists are the self-defense mechanism that all humans possess. They recognize everyone except Shirone as enemies. The moment the keyword 'death' was input, even we, who gained the trust of 7 and 10 gold, are no exception. It's nothing to be hurt about. The world is perceived as self and others, but to Egoists, it's only me, me, me. They don't even have the concept of 'others.'"

Having felt the blind hostility of the Egoists to her core, Amy shuddered.

"How do we fight from now on? They're so strong."

"No, this one was actually weak. The deeper we go, the stronger the Egoists become. That's why we must find Shirone's avatar in the surface layer. If we enter the 1st level instinctual domain, the Egoists will seize most of the consciousness to protect Shirone. In other words, they'll wield power comparable to Shirone, who is the master of this world. That's why divers never dive to the deep sea. Arius would have thought differently too if Shirone's unconscious hadn't been weakened."

Amy's eyes lit up as she spoke:

"Then aren't Arius and Zion in the same situation? You said Egoists get stronger as you go deeper, so maybe they'll die before even arriving."

Armin shook his head.

"No. He'll probably bypass Shirone rather than look for him. Grave robbers are experts on the human psyche. What looks like an ordinary world to us contains its own meaning in the objects here. Arius will interpret that meaning to find a direct path downward. Of course, the chances of getting caught increase from the REM domain onward, but by then, Shirone's unconscious will have collapsed considerably. Arius jumped in targeting that."

Reina said:

"Then how about we use Arius's method too? Amy knows Shirone well, so maybe she could interpret the objects here."

"Hmm, the form of consciousness differs from person to person. There are staircase types, plaza types, corridor types, and topological spaces. But usually, the gateway to descend to lower levels is configured underground. That's most natural for consciousness."

Amy said:

"Then couldn't we just look for a basement here too?"

Arius chuckled.

It seemed these women still didn't realize how terrifying a place human consciousness could be. Well, this was only the 11th level after all.

"I was speaking in general terms. The human mind is incredibly complex and delicate. Unless you're an expert, you'd have to search through every basement in this world, and even if you found them, you couldn't guarantee that place would be the entrance to the 10th level. We can't arrive faster than them anyway. But if we meet Shirone here, the situation could be reversed. We must continue injecting keywords."

Reina made a disgusted expression as she spoke:

"The Egoists will come after us every time, won't they?"

"This is the only way. That's why I told you not to come. It's ridiculous for me to say this after receiving help."

Amy didn't regret that decision. It was just awkward that Shirone was attacking her.

"Sigh. This feels strange. Having to fight against Shirone's mind."

Armin glared at her coldly.

"Amy, get a grip."

"What?"

"This isn't the time to be lost in sentiment. As you can see now, another person's mind is an extremely dangerous place. Even the best divers at Arius's level have lost countless lives here."

"I know that. That's why I'm tense."

"Are you really?"

Amy looked at Armin with confusion. She really was tense. No, she was even prepared to risk her life.

"You mustn't be mistaken. Shirone isn't tormenting us. We've entered Shirone's domain and are causing chaos. This is an extremely personal space that Shirone doesn't want to show to anyone. Miss Amy, you've entered that place. To then feel angry or disappointed at this world's reaction would be cowardly and base behavior."

"That's..."

Amy was at a loss for words.

As Armin said, she had never thought about it from Shirone's perspective. If someone entered her own mind and examined everything in detail... the very thought was horrifying.

"We're not going to meet Shirone. We're going to meet Shirone's avatar. The avatar is completely different from the Shirone you know on the surface. Miss Amy, you couldn't make a withdrawal. That might be disappointing, but perhaps it's natural for the avatar. If Miss Amy sees Shirone's avatar, no matter what he does, he'll definitely feel like he's not Shirone."

Reina added:

"Even though that would actually be the most accurate Shirone."

"Yes. What humans can know about others is only what's revealed outside the body. But avatars are different. They contain all the emotions that make up a human being mixed together. More precisely, they integrate even the shameful and embarrassing parts that can't be revealed to anyone. That's what we're going to see."

Amy thought quietly, then exhaled deeply and repeatedly slapped her cheeks with both palms. Her face stung, but thanks to that, she came to her senses. As Armin said, she wasn't tense at allâ€”she wasn't even prepared.

"I understand. I absolutely won't judge."

Armin saw the cold light settle in Amy's eyes and finally showed a satisfied smile. Without this level of resolve, there was no way to survive in another person's mind.

What if the inner thoughts of a man who confessed his love were actually just animal desire? What if the inner thoughts of someone you considered your closest friend were actually filled with jealousy and envy?

How many people in the world wouldn't feel betrayed after learning such truths?

Arius emphasized once again:

"Ataraxia will be at least in the 3rd level of the deep layer or below. And that's a place where things you absolutely don't want to show others are gathered."

"Yes. I won't be interested in anything. I have inner thoughts I want to hide too. I'm sorry for being childish. I guess my emotions were shaken without me knowing because the withdrawal didn't work."

Reina said:

"It's okay. I didn't think that far either. And I would have felt hurt too if the withdrawal hadn't worked on me."

Amy smiled bitterly.

"Shirone probably has things he's hurt about regarding me too. I was thinking wrongly. No matter how strong his mental fortitude is, he's still human with the same emotions as everyone else."

Armin was watching outside the alley when he slowly turned his head to look at Amy.

"What... did you just say?"

"What? Oh, that Shirone has the same emotions..."

"No, not that. Did you say something about vajra state?"

Amy blinked in confusion, then spoke quickly when she saw Armin's expression was more serious than expected.

"Yes. There's a famous monk teacher at school called Master Ethela, and she said that. She said to use Ataraxia, you'd have to at least reach the vajra state."

"Oh no, you fool...!"

Armin struck his forehead with his palm.

How could he not have thought of it?

No matter how much it's engraved in instinct, Ataraxia is too vast a concept for humans to contain.

Normally, it would be enough capacity to destroy one's mind.

But Shirone was using it. Therefore, the teacher called Ethela had hit the mark.

"I'm sorry, Miss Amy. I've been showing off all this time. I was the fool. I want to punch myself in the head several times."

"What? What did I..."

Armin grasped Amy's shoulders and gave her strength.

"You saved us all. Follow me. We're going to Shirone."

Reina finished maintaining her bow and stood up.

"So we're fighting the Egoists?"

"No. We're going to bypass them too. Like Arius."

Armin was confident of success.

With this method, they could catch up to Arius. Most importantly, it was a method that Zion's group, who had to avoid Shirone, couldn't use even if they knew about it.

Armin led the two women out into the street. The Egoist's terrorization had moved far away, as none could be seen nearby.

Cutting through rainwater that reached their ankles, they arrived at the outskirts of the main road. A carriage was parked there, and a coachman sat on the driver's seat, getting soaked in the rain.

He wore a wizard's hat with a narrow brim, but for some reason, only his face was shrouded in shadow, making it impossible to see his features. He looked like a person without a face.

When Armin approached, the coachman spoke without even glancing at him:

"No service today."

Armin took out all his remaining gold coins and showed them.

"There's somewhere I urgently need to go. Please consider my situation."

Since it was an amount that exceeded Armin's trust rating, the coachman couldn't firmly refuse. As expected, his voice softened a little. But he still sounded reluctant.

"Service is difficult on a day like today. Too much rain. Where exactly are you trying to go in weather like this?"

Armin glanced back at the two women waiting behind him, then made his request to the coachman:

"Let's go somewhere where it's not raining."

The coachman's head turned toward Armin as if electrocuted. The movement was so bizarre that the watching women gulped. The coachman slowly faced forward, gripped the reins, and said:

"Please get in, sir."
