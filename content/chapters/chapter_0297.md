The carriage carrying Armin's group raced toward the castle gates.

The wagon wheels crushed through rainwater that had risen to knee height, spraying torrents of water outward.

The carriage bounced roughly over rocks as it entered the rugged mountain path. Amy and Reina gripped the handholds tightly with both hands.

"We should arrive soon. It's fortunate it's not far."

Amy stuck her face out the window. Beyond the sky covered with pitch-black storm clouds, she could see a massive pillar of light descending as if a hole had been punched through.

As they entered that area, the sound of rain disappeared and a warm meadow bathed in sunlight spread before them.

Getting off the carriage, Armin's group looked back at the path they had traveled. Lightning like static electricity was occurring between the storm clouds and the horizon that seemed almost close enough to touch.

Even in the place where the sun shone down, the coachman's face could not be discerned. Amy thought he was probably just some nobody that even Shirone wouldn't have a particular impression of.

Shirone was sitting in the meadow below the hill, looking at flowers.

His back was turned so they couldn't see his face, but if there was anyone who could exist alone in the realm of Diamond Body, it could only be Shirone.

His profile, turning his head to follow a butterfly fluttering by, wore a beautiful smile.

Reina, who now understood the mental world, was amazed.

Even in the terrible situation of reality, Shirone's mind was not shaken in the least. She felt she understood why he had been able to make accurate judgments in countless crises.

'But... would it be alright to talk to him?'

Reina couldn't readily approach.

Strictly speaking, it wasn't Shirone but Shirone's avatar. Since even intimate emotions were integrated, he might be hurt by an unexpected response.

"Let's go. There's nowhere to retreat anyway."

Armin pushed Reina's back and approached Shirone. Sensing their presence, Shirone turned his head.

Saliva went down Reina's throat with a gulp.

"Oh? Mr. Armin? Sister Reina too?"

Shirone greeted the two with a bright expression.

"It's been a while. Have you been well?"

Armin examined Shirone intently.

'Truly remarkable.'

Shirone's avatar was almost no different from his usual appearance.

Among the avatars Armin had met so far, there had been famous personalities from the world. But even such people usually revealed disappointing true natures at the avatar stage more often than not.

You couldn't blame them for it.

Because that's what it means to be human.

But Shirone was different.

While everyone tends to commit transgressions in places where they can't be seen, Shirone's heart had reached a pure state regardless of others' gazes.

This was a form of avatar that could not emerge without refining and cultivating one's inner self from childhood.

'The rumor that he's Tormia's greatest prospect wasn't empty talk.'

Armin had been consistently informed of Shirone's achievements even after parting ways a year ago. This kind of mental completeness was what supported his abnormally rapid progress that couldn't be explained by talent alone.

"But what brings you here?"

The avatar knows this is the mental world. However, it cannot separate it from the dimension of reality. It was like being unable to know that something is a dream while dreaming.

Reina asked Armin.

"Shirone doesn't know why we came? We've been continuously injecting keywords all this time."

"There's no clear line regarding how much he knows. The avatar dominates the whole, but strictly speaking, it's not the entire whole."

"It's like a kind of core code."

"That's right. All of this is the avatar's function, but it's not imbued with the avatar's will."

"Um..."

Amy's voice was heard.

When the two turned their heads, they could see an Egoist over 2 meters tall embracing Amy with its four arms. The upper right arm had transformed like a rope and was choking her neck.

'There shouldn't be any projectiles?'

Reina looked around and realized the coachman had disappeared.

But why had it manifested as an Egoist? Wasn't Shirone clearly friendly toward them?

"Shirone, why are you doing this?"

"Just... seeing Amy makes me irritated."

Armin sighed.

What he had feared had come to pass.

Connecting cause and effect is the realm of reason. Conversely, emotion is faithful to momentary feelings.

In reality, the two are strictly separated, but the problem was that an avatar, being a mental entity, could not do so.

"Shirone, you need to suppress your emotions as much as possible right now. You're probably sensing it, but Shirone, your life is in danger. You must have our cooperation. Amy's cooperation too, of course."

Though Armin's persuasion didn't make Shirone understand, since it was a matter of life and death, he had no choice but to comply.

As he suppressed his emotions, the Egoist became blurry and then turned into black smoke.

Amy, who had been coughing while rubbing her neck, looked at Shirone with sad eyes. She had been prepared for this, but actually receiving such treatment made disappointment wash over her.

"What exactly is the reason? You have to tell me so I can fix it."

Shirone didn't know the reason either. Memories related to Amy bubbled up like a fountain, but to an avatar that couldn't arrange cause and effect in order, he could only feel the emotions of those situations.

Shirone distanced himself from her and turned to Armin.

"What should we do now?"

"First, we'll infiltrate into Shirone's depths. If we don't catch up to the intruders, there's no way to recover the situation."

"But I don't know the way down."

"No, you do know. The reason Shirone accepts the current situation without feeling anything strange is because you know. It's just that your logical system has collapsed so you can't draw conclusions. Think that you need to go down. And tell us the first place that comes to mind."

Shirone, lost in thought, pointed to the western mountain range.

"It's not certain, but..."

"That's enough. Now, let's depart."

Armin sat in the driver's seat instead of the vanished coachman.

The place they arrived at after driving for about an hour in the direction Shirone indicated was a small village.

Heavy rain was pouring there too, but when Shirone entered, the weather cleared as if by magic.

Shirone guided the group to a shabby stable. When he grabbed a handful of the soft straw scattered on the floor and moved it aside, a door leading underground appeared.

"Oh, there really is a door?"

"Rather, it would be correct to say it was designated. There is a door wherever Shirone thinks there is one. Remember this sensation. At this rate, we should be able to catch up to Arius and Zion."

Hearing the two names, Shirone's face twisted viciously.

Armin flinched in surprise and looked back. Though it had disappeared now, for a moment he had felt a killing intent that seemed not of this reality.

'What was that situation just now?'

Armin realized he needed to revise his thoughts.

Shirone's avatar appeared no different from usual, but perhaps that wasn't everything.

* * *

The 8th level of Shirone's mind.

Arius was collecting information independently as he broke through the depths.

The place he was currently exploring was a garbage dump where the stench made it hard even to breathe.

As the unbearably unpleasant smell blew on the wind, Zion covered his mouth with a handkerchief.

'What the hell is this smell? It's not even the smell of corpses.'

It was the fear that Shirone felt, manifested as smell. It was the smell of death that could not exist in reality.

Already accustomed to it, Arius paid no attention to the stench and grabbed a passing man to ask.

"Where is there a library nearby?"

The man covering his nose only pointed in a direction and hurried on his way.

Arius headed to where the man had indicated. Upon entering the library, the stench disappeared and it felt like his breathing cleared.

Zion shook out his handkerchief but, thinking it was beyond recovery, threw it on the ground. Then he looked around and said.

"A library this time?"

Arius ignored Zion's words and concentrated on examining the books. The books were classified by field, but the titles written on the covers wriggled like worms, making it impossible to tell what kind of books they were.

However, the titles of books in one corner were clear.

They were books related to photonics, Shirone's major.

Arius walked along the bookshelf, examining only the covers. Then he pulled out a book titled 'God Particle.'

When he knocked on the wall with that book, rectangular cracks appeared. The wall surface disappeared as if dissolving into air, revealing stairs leading downward.

"I've been curious about this for a while, but how exactly do you find things like this?"

"I'm tracking the flow connected to Shirone's unconscious. All things have inherent meaning embedded in them. It's a field that requires its own study. You could say it demands an excellent understanding of psychoanalysis."

"I see."

By the time Arius's explanation reached the middle, Zion had already lost interest.

As always, it was enough to leave complex matters to experts. He only wanted to extract Ataraxia and get out of this place as quickly as possible.

When the door to the 7th level opened, a plaza spread out. There was no torrential rain that seemed like it would submerge the world, no bitter cold that felt like it would shatter bones, no stench that seemed like it would rot noses.

Zion adjusted the leather strap of Armand at his waist and mentally rearmed himself.

"This place is at least livable."

As soon as Zion finished speaking, a man fell. The man fell face first and died with his brain matter spilling out.

Looking around, people were climbing onto rooftops everywhere.

Those committing suicide appeared one after another. At the window of one building, they could see a woman standing on a chair, hanging herself.

"What the hell is this?"

Arius, who had been watching from behind Zion, said.

"The 7th level is the gateway just before entering the REM domain. It's a layer where reason is strong. The projectiles facing death are showing symptoms of nervous breakdown."

"Kyaaaaaah!"

Two sisters falling from the 4th floor let out ear-splitting screams.

Zion frowned.

He didn't care about the sisters' deaths, and the miserable corpses were none of his business. He just wished they would die quietly instead of making noise when they died.

"Let's go quickly. What an annoying level."

"No. We'll stay for a while. If by chance they met Shirone's avatar, it would be troublesome. They could reach the depths much faster than us."

"Hmm, then?"

Arius pointed to a castle beyond the city.

"Here we'll meet the master of consciousness. Shirone's superego. In diver terminology, it's called an Antithesis."

"Antithesis?"

"It's the consciousness that criticizes Shirone. It's as strong as an Egoist, but currently, facing death, it should be considerably weakened. That will buy us time."

Arius turned his steps northward. Since the passersby's nerves were sensitive enough to commit murder at the slightest brush of clothes, they had to be careful with their behavior.

The place they arrived at was a castle so small in scale compared to reality that it was no more than a miniature. However, it had a quaint charm. Seven red spires stood beyond the ramparts, and guards were protecting the entrance beyond a moat that was no more than a stream.

As they approached the arch, the guards crossed their spears to block the entrance.

"Halt. Who are you?"

"We've come to meet the ruler of this place."

"Lord Ignite is on sick leave. Go back."

Arius smiled meaningfully.

The ruler's name generally adopts the concept with the strongest impression in reason. And Ignite was the name of an ignition magic.

"That's exactly why we've come. I have medicine that can cure the illness."

The guards were confused. After exchanging glances, one guard went into the inner castle.

Shortly after, he returned and granted Arius entry.

Once inside, it was far from splendid. It looked like a military barracks stationed at the front lines.

Like the citizens, the soldiers were also in a sensitive state, but under Ignite's control, they were performing their duties without disorder.

At the end of the hall with red carpet, Ignite sat with his chin resting on his hand. He was nearly 2 meters tall, with an impressive mustache tinged with brown that caught the eye.
