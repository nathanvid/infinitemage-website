Zion tilted his head at the vaguely familiar impression.

"I'm sure... wasn't it Vincent?"

Arius explained as they walked across the carpet.

"A considerable portion will be projected. The superego is heavily influenced by the father figure. Normally, it would be strong enough to suppress even the egoist."

Ignite greeted them with a haughty smile.

"So, you have medicine to cure me?"

Arius, shocked, couldn't answer for a moment. He felt an overwhelming presence, as if facing a wild beast.

'This is ridiculous. This is supposed to be a weakened superego?'

For ordinary people, the superego should be paralyzed when facing death. But Ignite was still radiating energy with a robust appearance.

'I can't help but be impressed.'

Even Arius, who had explored countless minds, had never encountered such a strong superego.

Those with steel-like critical consciousness never let their guard down in any situation. The rumors that Shirone had the makings of a first-rate mage were based on this very disposition.

Zion snorted and said.

"Still putting on airs even when dying? Just like the insufferable bastard he is."

Arius thought that Zion's superego must be truly weak.

"There's no medicine that can cure my illness. Because this world is already sick. So, what business brings you to me? I'll overlook the first lie, but from now on, you must speak only the truth."

Since crude lies wouldn't work on the superego, the master of reason, Arius confessed honestly.

"We must kill Shirone."

The soldiers lined up in the hall all glared at Arius with identical movements. However, being under Ignite's control, they didn't manifest as egoists.

"Why should I do that?"

Ignite lifted the massive axe that had been leaning against the back of his chair with one hand.

The moment he grasped the weapon, the air became heavy as steel bars, constricting both men's chests.

Zion, terrified, drew Armand. As he activated Diamond Body, the sword split apart and wrapped around him like armor. Simultaneously, Ignite's subordinates raised their weapons.

Arius let out a reproachful sigh. But needing Zion's help to achieve his goal, he abandoned his original strategy and joined the violence.

"Just hold them off for a moment. This will be over quickly."

"What are you going to do?"

Arius walked toward Ignite. The bluish light of Confuse, a mental magic spell, gathered in his palm.

"...I'll have to perform mental reconstruction."

"Cough! Cough!"

Shirone's group burst into coughing fits as they emerged from the door leading to the 7th level. The stench from the garbage dump was so ingrained in their minds that they still felt like they could smell it.

But the situation here wasn't any better. Shirone's group stood motionless in front of the door with blank expressions.

The plaza floor was littered with corpses whose heads had been smashed. People were falling from rooftops like rain.

In one area, citizens were fighting each other, beating one another as if to kill. Even though this wasn't reality, such a horrific scene was a first.

Armin watched the situation with a serious expression.

If the projections' behavior had reached such extremes, it meant Zenogger's noose was tightening faster than expected.

Shirone, who had been watching his world crumble with sad eyes, suddenly showed a fierce expression. He then mischievously grabbed Amy's hair and yanked it.

"Ow!"

Amy turned around with a bewildered expression.

"What's wrong?"

"Don't block me. I can't see."

Amy pouted her lips.

She couldn't understand why Shirone, who was kind to others as if this were reality, only treated her this way. She wanted to punch him, but remembering her resolve before meeting the avatar, she controlled her emotions.

"Fine, sorry, whatever."

As Amy shrugged and turned around, Shirone fell into confusion instead.

She was a good person and on his side. So why did he feel bad?

"Why did you come to save me?"

Amy flinched at the question from behind. But without turning around, she pondered for a moment before giving a brief answer.

"Because we're friends."

From those words, Shirone pulled up memories from reality. They were memories as terrifying as nightmares.

The world was turned upside down and his body hurt as if it were burning. He could see Amy bound like a cocoon to the opposite wall. Though he couldn't guess the exact situation, it was extremely unpleasant.

"But you... couldn't save me."

Amy hung her head with a sad face.

Was that it? Did Shirone despise his own weakness for not being able to act?

"Shirone, that's..."

The moment Amy turned to explain, an egoist sprouted before her eyes. As she hurriedly stepped back, Arius and Reina also distanced themselves.

The projections with smashed heads began transforming into egoists one by one, starting to surround Shirone like a wall.

Reina looked at Armin and asked.

"What's happening?"

"Take cover!"

Amy wrapped her arms around Reina's waist and threw herself toward the 7th level entrance. As Reina turned her head, she saw a rain of arrows filling the sky.

Armin used Flicker magic to escape the radius.

Egoists rushed toward Shirone from all sides. After confirming that much, Amy closed the door.

Thud thud! Thud thud!

Dozens of arrows struck the door, making the palm holding the door handle tingle.

As soon as the arrow rain stopped, she opened the door and checked on Shirone first. The egoists, formed into a ball shape, had a disgusting number of arrows stuck in them.

"Shirone! Are you okay?"

As the egoists separated and receded like a tide, Shirone could be seen standing in the same position as before. Even more egoists approached with sinister postures to protect him.

Amy breathed a sigh of relief and turned her head toward where Shirone was looking.

A group of troops was advancing. As the archer unit split left and right, the heavy cavalry unit moved to the front.

"What is that army?"

"It must be the antithesis. Egoists rationalize the self, while the antithesis criticizes it. If the superego is strong enough to be moral, then Shirone's antithesis will be quite powerful. Don't let your guard down."

Amy was shocked to see the cavalry unit's commander. It was a middle-aged man with a massive axe on his back, and even from a distance, his weight was extraordinary.

"Uncle Vincent?"

Except for being about 1.5 times larger and having scars on his face, his appearance was so similar that one could believe Vincent had appeared in disguise.

"I am Ignite, ruler of this city!"

Ignite's roar echoed thunderously through the plaza. Even the agitated citizens looked at him with suddenly alert expressions.

Ignite, holding his massive axe horizontally despite it being heavier than his body weight, pointed at Shirone and shouted.

"Shirone! Everyone suffers because of your selfishness. What dreams does a commoner dare to have! Your power wasn't earned through your efforts! It should rightfully be given to others! Now I will end all suffering with your death!"

Amy looked at Arius with an incredulous expression.

"That's supposed to be Shirone's critical consciousness? That's just typical loser logic!"

"Indeed. It seems Arius has manipulated the superego. Humans have as strong a desire for death as they do for life. It looks like we're in serious trouble."

"Shirone! Answer me! Are you justified? Having caused so much suffering, do you still wish to live?"

When humans are exposed to extreme fear or pain, thoughts of wanting to die sprout. Arius was able to easily manipulate Ignite by exploiting the fact that Shirone's world was diseased.

Every time Shirone heard Ignite's voice, his body trembled.

For the ego, the superego's message was as powerfully resonant as the Bible to a believer.

"That's right! This world became like this all because of Shirone!"

"Killing Shirone is the only way to regain peace!"

"Kill him! Kill Shirone!"

The projections in the plaza sided with Ignite and raised the banner of rebellion.

They were all antithesis, and as their numbers grew, Shirone's avatar became weaker.

"Get ready! They're coming this way!"

As Armin shouted, heavy infantry charged forward, shaking the ground. Archers drew their bowstrings from both sides of the plaza, and citizens also became an angry mob rushing forward.

"Everyone would be comfortable if only you weren't here!"

A citizen gripping a wooden club took a full swing stance in front of Shirone.

At the same moment, an egoist embraced him and knocked him to the ground. As it transformed its entire body into teeth and began gnawing, the antithesis screamed as it was torn apart.

But Ignite's subordinates couldn't be dealt with so easily. Rather, they overwhelmed the egoists with superior strength, swinging their weapons.

Egoists defeated by the antithesis made deflating sounds as they crumbled into pieces.

"Kill Shirone! Everyone charge at Shirone!"

Dead projections transformed into egoists and fought to protect Shirone. Meanwhile, all the citizens became antithesis.

Desire and reason collided at the center of the plaza.

In this close battle, the variable that made the difference was undoubtedly Ignite's presence.

He was stronger than any egoist and far exceeded the power of other antithesis. Every time he swung his massive axe, egoists burst apart like dust.

"Shirone! It's not yours! Let it go!"

Armin, watching the battle, was incredulous.

'How can this be possible?'

Reason was defeating desire.

This meant his convictions were strong, but considering the situation, they were absurdly strong. Even soldiers who die for their country would have stronger survival desires when their lives are truly threatened.

'But desire is losing? His throat is being cut in reality, isn't it? Can this really be called the mind of an eighteen-year-old boy?'

Arius probably didn't expect the antithesis to win either. If Ignite captured Shirone, they wouldn't be able to obtain Ataraxia either.

Shirone's convictions transcended human limits.

Like the prophets of history, Shirone was a human who could willingly die for his beliefs.

"This won't do. Let's join the battle too."

Armin cast Flicker and infiltrated the battlefield.

In any case, saving Shirone was the immediate priority. If the avatar was defeated, they would no longer be able to catch up with Arius.

Amy defended herself with Fire Mist and cast Fire Wall.

As she sent a barrier of fire racing along the boundary between egoists and antithesis, the crowd split in two.

Concentrating her mind, the height of the Fire Wall soared. Heavy infantry soldiers screamed in agony, unable to remove their heated armor.

Reina climbed onto a rooftop and sniped the archer unit. The arrows purchased from Nade's projection had several times the penetrating power of reality, easily piercing through two or three people with a single shot.

"Move aside! I'll execute him personally!"

Ignite's voice came from beyond the Fire Wall barrier. Soon after, he appeared, breaking through the fire barrier.

With his massive axe on his shoulder in a swinging stance, his first target was Amy. Countless egoists attacked him, but they scattered with a single axe swing.

"Amy! Danger!"

Reina took four arrows from the quiver on her thigh and held them between her fingers.

In an instant, four shots were fired. Moreover, the targeted areas were different: shoulder, wrist, thigh, and heart.

Without taking his eyes off Amy, Ignite perceived the arrows outside his focus and gripped his massive axe with both hands, spinning it.

An unimaginable gale sound whirled around.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

The arrows with strong penetrating power didn't bounce off when they hit the axe blade. But the arrow shafts bent at 90 degrees, lost their force, and crashed to the ground.

"Foolish girl!"

Ignite continued his charge while brilliantly wielding his massive axe. And right in front of Amy, he brought the axe blade behind his back.

As his upper body straightened, Amy felt as if a wall had appeared before her eyes. There was no time to cancel Fire Wall and activate another spell.
