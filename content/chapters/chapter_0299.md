"Do not threaten our peace!"

The speed of the massive axe descending toward her crown was so fast it was difficult to follow with the eyes.

It was only a brief moment, but Amy realized this place would be her final destination.

'Goodbye, Shirone...'

It would be a bad ending.

But on the other hand, she thought this might not be such a bad conclusion. This was Shirone's mental world, after all. She would sleep eternally in his embrace.

"Graaaaaaah!"

A wild, frenzied roar that jolted her consciousness rang in Amy's ears. At the same time, something pitch black swept quickly past before her eyes.

When she came to her senses, Ignite had been thrown ten meters away.

Amy felt a presence behind her and turned around.

But to properly examine it, she had to crane her neck all the way up to the sky.

It was an Egoist covered entirely in thorn-like protrusions. Its height was over six meters, and it glared forward in an awkward stance that seemed positioned between quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion.

Egoists manifest in specific forms by borrowing the avatar's desires. That process wasn't finished yet, and all the Egoists in the plaza dissolved into black smoke and were absorbed into it. It didn't grow any taller, but the thorns on its torso grew abnormally long.

"Graaaaaaang!"

Egoist - Wrath Form.

The massive shadow monster roared and leaped over Amy.

When the object blocking her view disappeared, she could see Shirone with a terrifyingly fierce expression.

'Shirone is...?'

Shirone was someone whose reason was stronger than desire. But the current Egoist was emanating strength in a form completely different from anything she had experienced before.

'Could it be that he's trying to save me?'

Knowing the hostility harbored by Shirone's avatar, Amy avoided hasty conclusions.

But she couldn't help the warm expectation that filled her chest. It had always been that way. Whenever dangerous situations arose, Shirone had always protected her.

The Egoist (Wrath Form) tore apart hundreds of Antitheses and still overflowed with power. Even Ignite's subordinates equipped with weapons were sent flying with a single kick.

"Shirone! Do you dream of living such a petty life to the very end!"

Ignite, who had risen while coughing up blood from his throat, gripped his massive axe and charged toward the monster. Then he leaped high and swung the axe behind him.

Arching his back like a bow, he sprang his body like a spring and brought the axe down. The Egoist's head split in half.

A smile formed on Ignite's lips, but the expected scream didn't come. The Egoist's state transmitted through the handle was still angry, seething, and ready to explode.

The moment Ignite showed alarm, Wrath Form's clawed hand struck his face.

As he fell to the ground with half his face gone, a leg thicker than a pillar trampled him.

Kuuuuung!

The ground shook and the battle ended.

"Aaaah! R-run!"

The Antitheses scattered in all directions, pale with shock. The Egoist roared as it chased after them to annihilate even one more.

The plaza where only Shirone's group remained was clean without a single corpse.

Amy, who had come to the brink of death, collapsed with a thud. Shirone approached her.

Amy turned her head and realized Shirone had come, her heart pounding. Had his anger finally subsided? Had he returned to the gentle Shirone of before?

"Shirone, thank you. If it weren't for you..."

"You really piss me off."

Shirone spoke while looking at the ground without even making eye contact.

"You really, truly piss me off."

Then he coldly turned away and walked off.

Even now, he couldn't understand why he had saved Amy.

Just before the massive axe split her head, he had been seized by an intense impulse. From the next moment, his indignation exploded and he couldn't think of anything.

Amy hung her head dejectedly.

Reina, who had been secretly hoping for reconciliation between the two, patted her shoulder comfortingly.

"Don't be too disappointed. If we just save Shirone, all the misunderstandings will..."

Before Reina could finish speaking, Amy suddenly lifted her head.

Contrary to expectation, her face was bright. She even looked somewhat relieved.

"It's okay. Anyway, Shirone saved me. Maybe he doesn't hate me to the bone after all. That's enough, right? Haha!"

Even though she spoke that way, Reina could guess how great Amy's sense of loss must be.

She was desperately holding on, solely to save Shirone.

"Yeah, let's hang in there just a little longer."

Reina looked back at Armin. Having been deep in Antithesis territory disrupting enemy forces, his clothes were soaked with sweat.

"Are the Antitheses gone now?"

"They haven't disappeared. But there shouldn't be any more manipulated Antitheses. Still, we can't let our guard down. They're fundamentally mental entities that criticize Shirone."

After a brief rest in the plaza, they followed Shirone's guidance into the castle. Though Ignite had been there just moments before, no more projections were visible.

Shirone went down to the basement. Then he walked through the maze-like winding path without a single wrong turn.

When he opened the storage room door, stairs leading to another basement level appeared.

Armin, who had pulled out a torch on the first basement level, walked down alongside Shirone. Then he stopped the group in front of an old wooden door and looked back.

"If we go through this door, we'll enter the dream world, the REM domain. Before entering, there are several things I need to convey. You've all had dreams before, but here different physical laws apply than in reality. Simply put, it can be called focus."

"Something like concentration?"

"Similar. Reality is a continuous cycle of focus and relaxation. In ordinary life, the relaxation periods are overwhelmingly longer. But dreams have only focus. It's like following the dramatic structure of a play. You only see what you want to see, and other situations don't exist. Therefore, if you lose focus, you lose yourself. This is called Relfin."

Armin spread five fingers.

"Relfin is broadly divided into five types. First, floating sensation. Second, meaningless muttering. Third, repetition of identical sections. Fourth, perspective detachment. Fifth, realization of anxiety."

Amy thought she understood. These were things she had often experienced while dreaming too.

"Dreams only imitate gravity; they don't actually have gravity. Keep confirming the feeling that your feet are touching the ground. The moment you feel a floating sensation, you'll rise endlessly. And you mustn't utter words without conviction."

"So conversation must have focus too. Like a play's script."

"That's right. Habitual slang is also forbidden. If you lose linguistic focus, you'll repeat meaningless words."

"Then repetition of identical sections is spatial focus?"

"Yes. You mustn't thoughtlessly look back or run away. Focus disappears and you'll just repeat the same section. Fourth, if you focus on surrounding situations, you'll lose yourself and fall into an observer's position. Finally, don't have anxious thoughts."

"Because they'll become reality."

Armin nodded at Reina's words.

Amy, who had been lost in thought, asked.

"What happens if you get caught in Relfin? For example, if you get caught in floating sensation Relfin and rise up, or if you can't stop meaningless muttering?"

"As long as we don't all get caught simultaneously, you can escape. If you float up, Amy, we'll pull you down, and if it's meaningless muttering, we might slap your cheek."

Amy puffed out her cheek as if she'd already been slapped.

Reina asked.

"What if we can't escape?"

"Eventually you'll catch a new focus. But that will be our focus, not Shirone's focus. Ultimately, you'll dream a new dream."

"A dream within a dream."

"That's right. This is why Drimo is called a multidimensional world. It wouldn't matter in your own dream, but this is someone else's world. If you get buried too deep, you might never escape from the dream for the rest of your life."

Everyone who heard Armin's explanation tensed up.

"Don't worry. If we just focus on Shirone walking toward the next exit and us following behind him, there shouldn't be any major problems."

Shirone took a deep breath and grasped the door handle.

"Then... I'll open the door."

With Armin's approval, the door slowly opened.

Music drifted faintly, then court musicians' performance struck their hearts.

Amy narrowed her eyes at the familiar scene.

"This place is...?"

Countless couples were dancing in the grand hall. It was the ballroom of Kazura Royal Castle where they had been just hours before.

Armin hastily explained something he had overlooked.

"The REM domain is one space that changes fluidly. It's like multiple plays being performed on the same stage. If the background is the grand hall, the exit should be close."

"The exit is over there."

Shirone pointed to the opposite side of the ballroom.

Amy thought she knew why. It was the door through which she had left the grand hall with Zion. Shirone had probably gone out through that door to look for her. And then this whole mess had happened.

'It was because of me.'

Amy smiled bitterly.

If she hadn't followed Zion, if she had refused his request, would Shirone be in a different situation now?

'Hehe, come to think of it, I'm certainly worth hating.'

"Amy, you mustn't lose focus."

Amy hastily came to her senses. Then she repeated deep breaths while maintaining clear eyes.

"Yes, I'm ready."

"Then let's depart. Shirone, please walk straight without bumping into anyone as much as possible."

Shirone moved his steps carefully. When dancing couples passed by, he stopped and waited. If he carelessly detoured, he might fall into Relfin.

Amy and Reina only stared at the back of Shirone's head. Meanwhile, Armin was walking leisurely while observing the surroundings. This was possible because he had obtained lucid dream certification to carry out certain missions.

'What exactly happened?'

Since the real Shirone was awaiting a terrible death, the situation in the REM domain was likely to be a nightmare as well.

That's why he was tense.

At any moment, everyone in the ballroom might transform into monsters, or people might suddenly go mad and start a massacre.

But even after crossing half the ballroom, nothing particular happened.

Since focus had already passed over the path they'd traveled, the probability of something happening there was virtually nil.

'Strange. What kind of situation is this nightmare about?'

Armin's eyes lit up as he discovered something.

'Indeed, so that's what it was.'

In the center of the ballroom, there was a man and woman dancing. A beautiful woman in a rose-red dress and a man with strange features.

The man's eyes were completely slanted upward, his nose was a pig nose, and his lips were smaller than a chicken's rear end. Though it was a human face, it was a form that couldn't exist in reality.

'He must have really hated him.'

If it were just this alone, nothing major would happen to third parties. But for Shirone, it would be the most terrible nightmare of all.

Turning his gaze, Armin spotted someone serving near the long table.

He was wearing clothes of the grassland people that didn't match the royal castle scenery at all. He wore a red hat, had a handsomely grown beard, and was boldly smoking a pipe even in a no-smoking area.

The only being that wasn't Shirone's projection - Ruber, a dream person dispatched from Drimo.

Ruber looked back at Armin and gave him a playful wink. But Armin looked at him indifferently before turning his head away.

He wasn't someone to casually ask about out of curiosity. Currently, dream people couldn't be analyzed with human intelligence. He was simply acknowledging their existence because they actually existed.

When Shirone reached the exit, the focus on the path they'd traveled ended and the music disappeared.

Was the ball still going on in the grand hall? Curiosity arose, but no one looked back.
