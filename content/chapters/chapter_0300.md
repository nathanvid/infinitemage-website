"We've arrived. If we open this door, we should be able to go down."

"I see. Then from now on, we'll be entering Shirone's unconscious."

Amy, understanding Armin's words, took a deep breath.

Beyond this door lay Shirone's true emotions.

Judging by his incarnation state, there wouldn't be any ugly desires. But there might be yearnings equivalent to them.

'It doesn't matter. It's not like I'm clean either. Everyone has such feelings.'

Shirone hesitated to open the door. It seemed he was conflicted about descending to the lower level.

Eventually, he removed his hand from the doorknob and looked back at Amy with an unpleasant expression.

"I don't think you need to come along..."

Suddenly, Shirone lifted his head and rolled his eyes back. Then, trembling like someone having a seizure, he collapsed.

"Shirone!"

Amy caught Shirone and checked his condition. His face was pale, and his lungs were moving roughly as if his breath might stop at any moment.

"What happened? What's wrong?"

A rumbling vibration was felt, and the ceiling of the Grand Hall began to collapse. As rocks larger than people came crashing down, Armin threw open the door and shouted.

"There's no time! The unconscious is collapsing!"

* * *

Kazura Royal Castle food storage.

Zenogger's wire finally cut through Shirone's blood vessel. Thousands of blood droplets burst from the wound with a pop, then spread slowly, matching the decelerated flow of time.

The repercussions in reality immediately affected the mind.

The 11th level rainfall surged, submerging half the city in water. The projections floating on the rapids let out cries close to screams.

Among the crowd flowing down to the lowlands was Nade's manifestation, the Egoist's terror incarnation.

"Kiaaaaaa!"

The Egoist flailed its limbs, desperately trying to escape. But ultimately unable to overcome the rapidly rising water level, it sank below the surface with desperate screams.

**Secrets of the Abyss (1)**

Shirone's mental 5th level.

Creakâ€”the door opened with an old sound.

The aura of vigilance penetrated before the people did.

Only after some time had passed did Arius with a flushed face and Zion, his entire body protected by Armament, cross the threshold.

"This place... is Shirone's unconscious?"

Zion was bewildered by the situation, which was different from his expectations.

The 5th level they had arrived at was a library with bookshelves extending beyond sight.

The Knowledge Spine.

Just by examining a few bookshelves, Arius realized that history was arranged in chronological order.

'This is... beyond amazing, it's inhuman.'

He had dived into the minds of high-ranking mages far superior to Shirone. But even their unconscious arrangements were unruly and chaotic beyond measure.

That was natural. Rather, it would be strange if a human's unconscious were standardized.

Zion asked in a disappointed voice.

"What the hell is this? You said we could see everything about Shirone laid bare?"

"It's the Knowledge Spine."

"Knowledge Spine?"

"History arranged chronologically. Not only is this difficult to create, but it's hard to succeed even if you try. It seems Shirone's unique growth process played a role."

Zion snorted.

Shirone had grown up as the son of a mountain hunter, the lowest of the lowly. No matter how much the bastard flew and leaped, he couldn't be better than someone who had received imperial theory lessons from birth.

"It's certainly an ignorant method. In other words, he crammed it in through brute force, right? Just like uneducated people who can't understand but only memorize."

"Is that really so?"

Arius wore a pleased smile.

It was certainly impressive.

Not that the Knowledge Spine itself was impressive, but the fact that it resided in the deep 5th level, below the REM domain, was astonishing.

"You can't establish a spine in the unconscious realm through mere memorization. He understood it all. If so, the effect is excellent. No matter what knowledge he studies, he can arrange it systematically. It's incomparably more efficient than meaninglessly stuffing in knowledge."

Zion's expression crumpled.

Though his expression couldn't be seen due to the Armament helmet, Arius felt the killing intent rising from him.

"Yes, this is it..."

Zion was in a bad mood.

Very much so.

Since childhood, he had absorbed everything that was considered good. No one in the world could have received a better education than Terase's son.

But such confidence had been repeatedly wounded since Shirone's appearance.

How could it make sense that a commoner's son could be better than an emperor's son?

Zion's breathing gradually became rough.

He looked at the books densely packed in the library.

Shirone couldn't have actually read tens of thousands of books. It only looked like a lot because the knowledge he understood and mastered was organized under perfect categories.

"Damn bastard!"

Zion drew blades from his gauntlets and wildly slashed at the bookshelves. Paper scraps fluttered like goose feathers, and the bookshelves were sliced as smoothly as cheese.

Moving to the next section, he swung both blades and destroyed Shirone's knowledge.

"There! How's this? Huh? I'll mess up everything in your head!"

Zion's voice trembled with ecstasy.

"Haha! This is fun! It would have been easy if I'd done this from the beginning! More, break more!"

Arius spoke in a cold voice.

"Stop it."

Though he wasn't one to care about others' words, even Zion had to stop his actions this time.

Slowly turning his head, he saw Arius sending him a cold gaze.

It was truly killing intent befitting one called the Seven Deadly Sins.

"What? Are you talking to me now?"

Though his lower abdomen churned, Zion didn't back down and confronted him.

He was Arius's employer, and employees shouldn't oppose their employers.

Even if this was Arius's territory, the mental world, the power of money spread throughout the entire universe.

As long as creatures called humans lived there.

Arius suppressed his killing intent.

'Damn brat...'

To be honest, he had almost really killed Zion.

The Knowledge Spine that Shirone had achieved was a pleasing sight to Arius as well.

Though he was notorious as one of the Seven Deadly Sins of the Black Line, in terms of intelligence alone, he was second to none among the world's scholars.

He understood better than anyone what thoughts Shirone had used to construct such a knowledge structure. Even if they were enemies, he couldn't help but feel a sense of camaraderie.

If they had met under different circumstances, he would have genuinely looked after Shirone.

Of course, judging by the personality he had experienced so far, the probability of him joining the Black Line was almost zero.

Arius suppressed his anger and returned to his former self.

Whatever his emotions, he was a professional. His beliefs didn't allow him to rebel against his employer.

"From now on, this is the unconscious realm. If you carelessly tamper with it, errors might occur in Ataraxia. So stop the destruction and let's go down."

Ataraxia would probably be safe. The deep 5th level was merely a result of the 4th level.

You couldn't change the cause by changing the result.

But Arius didn't want to see the Knowledge Spine destroyed even if it meant saying that.

Not because he cared for Shirone.

Truly, this place was a space that satisfied his intellectual aesthetic sense.

At the mention of Ataraxia, Zion also stopped slashing. He had spent a whopping 4 billion gold to obtain it, so any damage would be a tremendous loss.

"Fine. Since he's going to die anyway, I'll leave it at this."

Arius smiled with satisfaction.

"Then, shall we go down now?"

Though he was irritated to the top of his head by Zion's stupid actions, there was something gained from it. Despite damaging the Knowledge Spine, the Egoist wasn't appearing.

Since there were no projections from the REM domain downward, the Egoist could manifest anytime, anywhere to eliminate intruders.

This was one of the reasons why even divers with lucid dream certification were reluctant to descend to the deep levels.

'The Egoist isn't manifesting. It's about time for it to collapse.'

And this was exactly what Arius had been aiming for.

No matter how fast mental operations were, if they had come down to the 5th level, quite some time must have passed in reality. It was safe to assume that Shirone was currently suffering fatal injuries close to death.

'Can I finally see it, Ataraxia?'

Arius's eyes shone more intensely than ever.

* * *

Armin burst open the door and entered the 5th level. Following him, Shirone, supported by Amy, entered while gasping for breath.

Having barely escaped the collapse of the REM domain, Shirone could no longer walk and collapsed on the floor. His face was growing pale beyond recognition.

"Shirone! Are you okay? Pull yourself together!"

Amy worriedly stroked Shirone's cheeks.

But what came back was Shirone's rough rejection and cold voice.

"Get away from me."

Amy stepped back with a sad expression.

Even in such an urgent situation where his mental world was collapsing, Shirone's frozen heart showed no sign of thawing.

Glaring up at Amy with his eyes rolled upward, Shirone moved his lips as if trying to convey something as his dissolution approached. But the moment Amy turned away, his opened mouth closed again.

Amy looked around with a pounding heart.

No matter what she saw, she would never criticize Shirone. Even if it was bad feelings directed at her.

"This place is...?"

But she couldn't see anything.

What spread before her eyes wasn't raw emotions but the flow of history organized by categories.

The Knowledge Spine that Shirone had mentioned before.

When she first heard about it, she had only imagined a vague diagram, but seeing it in person, she thought he had truly accomplished an amazing task.

Having the Knowledge Spine carved into the 5th level was only possible if not a single piece of information was treated carelessly.

Understanding was impossible without connecting the causal relationships of all acquired information.

Shirone had achieved that.

She could clearly realize how much effort he had put in to catch up with the intellectual abilities of magic school students.

Armin, like Arius who had stayed here earlier, immediately grasped the characteristics.

The categories of information stored in the bookshelves were divided so that any item could be understood independently when examined.

'What exactly is this child...'

Above all, this was the realm of the unconscious.

There is information that is never forgotten throughout one's lifetime. People call this source knowledge.

Shirone had brought the Knowledge Spine down to the state of source knowledge.

While walking around the library, repeatedly expressing admiration inwardly, Armin discovered a section that was utterly destroyed.

Books were torn to shreds and bookshelves were also destroyed.

"It seems they came and went."

Discovering the devastatingly smashed bookshelves, Amy felt sick to her stomach. Knowing better than anyone what feelings Shirone had when completing the Knowledge Spine, resentment toward them welled up.

"Those bad bastards. How could they do this to such a thing..."

Amy gathered the scattered papers from the floor and finally shed tears.

She couldn't forgive Zion. She would make him pay the price somehow.

"Wait a moment."

Armin stopped her.

The collapsed bookshelves were regenerating as if a living being were healing its wounds.

Amy watched the process with a surprised expression.

"How is this possible?"

"Normally it would be impossible. But a complementary knowledge base is formed in a network structure. Even if one path is blocked, it immediately bypasses and establishes a new route. The Knowledge Spine will soon be restored to its previous state."

Reina asked.

"Then why did they destroy it? Arius would have known. He's an expert."

"Because he's an expert, that's why."

Reina tilted her head.

But Armin's explanation ended there. There was no point in praising the enemy when a confrontation was imminent.

Zion had destroyed it, and Arius had stopped him.

That was the only situation that came to mind.

Though disparaged by the world as a grave robber, he was a person with strong intellectual pride. He must have been strongly impressed by seeing Shirone's unconscious.

Like how an invader wouldn't want to damage artifacts from another country.
