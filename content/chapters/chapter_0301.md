"By the way, this is truly remarkable."

Shirone had perfectly categorized the unconscious into categories. Honestly, it was beyond remarkable—it didn't even seem human.

Armin's group turned toward the sound of footsteps coming from the entrance. Shirone approached, breathing heavily, his complexion darker than before.

"I'm feeling a bit better. Let's hurry down."

Amy wiped away her tears and approached Shirone.

"Are you okay? I'll support you."

"Stay away. I don't want your help."

"But we have to go anyway. Come here."

Amy paid no attention to his strong resistance and supported Shirone.

Shirone had no choice but to accept help, as he could no longer endure on his own.

Reina watched this scene with a bitter smile.

'So that's how it is.'

At first, she couldn't understand how they could ignore each other's feelings and remain friends.

But now she seemed to understand. The two were bound together by a powerful trust that transcended emotions.

'I... could never enter that space.'

"What a remarkable girl."

Armin approached Reina's side. In his mind, Amy was holding up well.

The hostility of an incarnation was 100 percent reliable in that it was pure emotion. Yet sacrificing for Shirone was not something an ordinary girl could do.

A relieved smile finally bloomed on Reina's lips.

"She's endured it for a whole year, after all."

* * *

Shirone's mental stage 3.

It was a world of bitter cold.

In the midst of bone-chilling cold that seemed to freeze even their blood, Shirone's group hunched their shoulders and crossed the frozen sea.

There was no sun, but the ground reflected moonlight, allowing them to see ahead.

However, all that stretched before them was endless darkness.

Amy imagined this was what an Arctic night would be like.

So cold and desolate, yet somehow mystical—this frigid resting place.

In the extremely limited visibility, what occasionally brushed past them were crystals as tall as a person.

Each had a different color and emitted a gentle light like bioluminescent organisms.

"Love. Friendship. Desire."

Armin spoke.

"Those are probably gems containing such fundamental emotions. We won't be able to access them unless we approach directly. He's treating his unconscious like consciousness. There's no need to worry."

Amy let out a sigh of relief.

Since they hadn't accessed his inner emotions, it wouldn't be awkward when they met Shirone again.

Of course, that was assuming they made it out of here alive.

Though they were descending deeper, Armin felt like he understood Shirone even less.

Even just looking at stage 3, this landscape would be impossible without establishing and defining everything within himself.

'How deep does this child's insight go?'

While thinking this, the crystal lights began going out one by one. Shirone's appearance became haggard, like someone about to die.

Amy didn't look back at Shirone.

He wouldn't want to show it.

She could only move forward without even wiping away her flowing tears.

The weight of the incarnation had become so light it could no longer be called human.

'Just a little more, just hold on a little more, Shirone...'

Even though it was difficult to take another step, Shirone focused his eyes and glared into the darkness.

Finally, the curtain of darkness lifted, revealing a small cabin with lights on.

"That's it. Mental stage 2."

Now everyone knew.

Armin moved his frozen legs quickly while explaining.

"We've essentially cut through the mental world by the shortest route. We might have caught up to Arius by now. Prepare for any contingency."

He meant to assume battle positions.

From then on, Amy began warming up mentally with heat formulas.

Reina also drew out an arrow frosted from the cold and placed it on her bowstring while leaning her back against the wall beside the door.

Armin quickly opened the door and entered, surveying the interior of the cabin. Though not a Zoner, his light eyes without visual directionality could scan all directions far faster than an ordinary person.

Next, Reina spun her body and entered the cabin.

She followed Armin while covering all directions with her bow aimed, but no enemies were visible.

When Armin signaled it was clear, Amy brought Shirone inside.

His skin, which had turned blue from the bitter wind, melted in the cabin's warmth.

When they closed the door, the howling wind disappeared without a trace.

"Over... there..."

Shirone pointed to the living room sofa with trembling hands.

When Amy brought him there, he collapsed onto the sofa like a puppet with cut strings.

"I just... want to rest a little."

"That would be good."

Armin, who had been examining Shirone's condition, agreed.

Then Reina took on the villain's role and spoke.

"We don't have time to delay. The fact that Arius isn't here means he's already descended to stage 1."

"Even if he found Ataraxia, extraction would take time. Even if we stop Arius, Shirone will die if we can't imprint something here."

"Ah..."

Reina recalled the situation in reality.

Zenogger's wire was cutting into Shirone's neck.

Now that they'd reached the depths of the mental layers, it was time to find a solution to that.

"Stage 1 is Shirone's most distant memory. It's called primordial consciousness. Since it occurs in the womb, it's impossible to plant a clear concept there."

"So this place is essentially Shirone's treasure vault."

Reina looked around.

The precious place Shirone had chosen was his own cozy home. She could imagine how much family warmth he had lived with.

Amy put dry firewood into the fireplace and cast Ignite.

Damn Ignite.

Thinking this to herself, she stretched out both hands to feel the warmth of the fire, then turned to face the group.

"Method aside, where should we record it?"

"It varies by person. But from what I've seen so far, it might be in the form of a book. Let's check the study first."

The three moved to the study.

Shirone's lifelong thoughts were classified in book form.

There were books with people's names as titles.

Vincent and Olina, of course, but also Reina and Armin were there without exception.

Amy, who had been scanning the names of magic school students, fixed her gaze on one book.

Karmis Amy.

It was a book with a red cover.

Everything was contained in that book.

What Shirone thought of her. What emotions he viewed her with.

Amy picked up the book as if bewitched and stroked the leather-textured hardcover.

Armin and Reina watched from behind.

"I won't stop you, Amy. If that satisfies you."

"Miss Amy has led Shirone well to this point. She has that right."

Reina looked at Armin with surprise.

She had given permission knowing it was wrong because she understood a woman's heart, but she hadn't expected Armin to agree as well.

One thought occurred to her.

'I see. The probability is much lower than we think?'

Armin was assuming the worst-case scenario.

If they couldn't find a way to save Shirone, this would be Amy's last memory with him. It was Armin's consideration for her to at least know his heart before saying farewell.

"No. I won't do that."

Amy only looked at the book's cover before putting it back on the shelf.

Nothing was over yet. Shirone would definitely survive. He would continue competing with her and become a mage.

"There doesn't seem to be a way to imprint something on Shirone here. Let's try somewhere else."

When Amy left the study without hesitation, Armin and Reina looked at each other and smiled.

Amy met eyes with Shirone, who was staring at her intently. But now she was in a state of detachment and didn't mind.

"Yes, hate me all you want. When we return to reality, I'll beat you up really good."

"I hate you. I really do."

"Hmph! Whatever. I hate you too, you know? Bleh!"

The moment Amy stuck out her tongue, Shirone coughed.

A mouthful of blood came up, and Amy's face went pale as she rushed over.

"Shirone! Are you okay?"

Even as his mental world was collapsing, his eyes had remained clear, but now they were unfocused.

The incarnation had become so light that weight could no longer be felt.

Shirone struggled to lift his trembling eyelids and spoke.

"Why... do you... hate me..."

"Yes, I know. I know, so please get it together."

"...I hate it."

Shirone said in a dying voice.

"I hate... seeing you dance... with someone else."

Amy felt like she'd been hit in the head with a hammer.

She had thought it was disappointment about not being able to save his life. She couldn't even imagine it was just because she had danced with Zion.

"That... that was, you know, Shirone..."

It had been an unavoidable situation.

No, was that really the case?

Was I completely blameless regarding Shirone's complaint?

"Idiot, it's not like that."

Amy said in a tearful voice.

The truth was, she had known Shirone would be hurt. Even so, she had no choice but to look away.

Because she had been too afraid.

"It's really not like that. I... I..."

Shirone squeezed out his fading voice.

"Run away... Take everyone... and leave this place. I can't... everyone will die."

Amy shook her head and embraced Shirone.

No matter what situation arose, she would not give up. She would absolutely not let him leave her arms.

"No one will die. I'll save you! I'll definitely save you!"

Shirone was losing consciousness.

No matter how loudly Amy shouted, it didn't seem to reach his ears, as he just stared at the ceiling with hazy eyes.

"Run away... Amy."

Reina, who had been checking Shirone's room, rushed into the living room shouting.

"Amy! Over here! I found it!"

Amy laid Shirone on the sofa and ran to the room.

She didn't even think to wipe her tears. They had reached the very end, so from now on it was do or die.

On the table in Shirone's room, a notebook lay open.

Armin was waiting, and Reina was stamping her feet, not knowing what to do.

Amy approached, pointing at the notebook.

"Is this it?"

"Yes. It seems to be a notebook recording the flow of consciousness. But no matter how I think about it, I can't come up with a way to save him. What do we do, Amy?"

Amy approached the table and examined the notebook.

At the top of the last page, "Amy" was written.

With a pitiful expression, she turned the page to understand Shirone's thoughts.

Amy's name was written there too.

And it filled the entire notebook.

She turned another page. It was the same.

No matter how many pages she turned, she couldn't find where Amy's name had started.

Amy's eyes welled up with tears again. But she hurriedly shook her head and pulled herself together.

She had to save Shirone. By any means necessary.

But how?

No matter how hard she thought, she couldn't come up with a way to safely extract Shirone with the wire around his neck.

At that moment, the cabin shook like an earthquake.

Amy grabbed the table and regained her balance.

If mental stage 2 was shaking this much, it meant Shirone's life in reality was almost over. At the very least, if they couldn't catch up to Arius, they would all end their lives here.

"Amy! We have to go down now! I'll bring Shirone!"

Reina rushed out of the room, but Amy couldn't move.

Even if she died here, she had to think of a way for Shirone to live.

'No! I don't know! What am I supposed to do?'

But reality was different from the mental world.

What couldn't be done, couldn't be done.

Neither Reina nor Armin were fools.

Weren't they looking for a way for at least the others to survive, knowing it was physically impossible?

Amy's hand trembled as she gripped the pen on the table. Every passing second felt cursed.
