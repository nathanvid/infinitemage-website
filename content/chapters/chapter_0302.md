Armin, who had been watching outside the door, urged her on.

"There's no time. If you're going to do something, you need to do it now."

Amy bit down on her molars and squeezed her eyes shut.

There was no way. But she couldn't just do nothing and descend to the 1st stage.

'If it were Shirone... if it were Shirone, he could do it.'

Amy opened to the last page and moved her pen.

Shirone.

This was the best she could do.

If she couldn't find a way to save him, she had no choice but to at least change the flow of consciousness.

At that moment, Reina shouted from the living room.

"Amy!"

Amy put down her pen and rushed to the living room with Armin.

A figure wearing armor that mixed the properties of biology and metal was charging toward Shirone.

"Zion!"

Fire blazed in Amy's eyes.

Arius, the only way to escape this place, was nowhere to be seen, but she actually felt good about it. Right now, the person she wanted to beat up most was Zion.

Reina pulled Shirone away by a hair's breadth, and Zion's blade split the sofa.

Amy threw a fireball enhanced by her surging anger. A flame twice as large as usual flew toward Zion and exploded at close range.

Blown away by the explosive force, Zion slammed his back against the wall. However, just before impact, tentacles grabbed the wall to minimize damage.

As Reina moved away with Shirone, Armin and Amy simultaneously blocked the way.

"A diversionary tactic."

When Armin's Spirit Zone was expanded to its maximum, it could cover the entire cabin and then some.

While he couldn't see through an assassin's Equalizing, he wasn't clumsy enough to miss Zion's presence.

'He was hiding in the 1st stage. So Arius has already gone down?'

Just as Armin's group had to remain in the 2nd stage to save the real Shirone, Arius also needed time to extract Ataraxia. That's why he sent Zion to buy time.

"You're determined to take it no matter what?"

As Armin stepped back toward Shirone, Reina, who immediately understood, stepped forward.

Flicker magic and low-powered spells couldn't deliver a shock to Armament.

"Amy, you know, right?"

"Yes."

The two recalled their battle in the food storage and moved apart from each other.

They planned to exploit Zion's weakness in handling blind spots.

"Hmph! I won't fall for it twice."

Zion sent tentacles in both directions to preemptively block the targets' dispersion. Then he used the tension of the tentacles embedded in the wall to fly toward Reina.

In the split second as Reina rolled on the floor, she shot her bow.

When the arrow hit the armor, Zion's body lifted into the air.

Amy spun her target-type Spirit Zone and fired Fire Strikes in rapid succession.

Each time the flame spears grazed him, the organic matter of the Armament crackled and burned.

"Insolent wench!"

Zion spun acrobatically in midair and kicked off the wall to fly forward.

When all eight tentacles embedded in the wall transmitted their force simultaneously, he achieved gale-like speed.

Amy only caught his afterimage as she twisted her body.

Zion, who crashed to the floor with a thud, rotated around his knee as the pivot point and swung his blade.

As a silver flash passed by, Amy's collar was cut away, exposing her collarbone and upper chest.

Red bloodstains gradually appeared on her milk-white skin. If the cut had been just a little deeper, it would have severed her aorta.

"You bastard..."

"Haha! You look exactly like a tavern whore!"

The blood seeping from Amy's wound flowed down along the valley of her gathered chest.

The contrast of white and red incited Zion's madness.

The moment he licked his lips with his tongue and took a charging stance, Shirone glared at Zion and frowned.

"Grrrrrr!"

Darkness gathered at the midpoint between Zion and Amy's confrontation, and a shadow with a sleek, smooth body shot up.

Egoist - Incarnation of Killing Intent.

Its jaw was pointed like an awl, and blade-sharp hair swept back in a large arc reaching down to its waist.

Its two monkey-like long arms were completely in the form of swords, and its reverse-jointed knees stored tremendous kinetic energy.

Even its soles were in the shape of crescent moons like skate blades.

"Shiiiiiiiii!"

At the teeth-chatteringly sharp wail, Zion stepped back with a disgusted expression.

When the Incarnation of Killing Intent compressed its reverse joints and released them, it disappeared without even leaving an afterimage.

Then it hadn't charged straight ahead.

But since he couldn't even guess its trajectory, Zion's pupils remained frozen.

*Warning. Mobile object detection impossible. Nervous system paralysis. Converting to automatic defense mode.*

As the warning was transmitted at the speed of thought, Zion's cloak wrapped around its master. Simultaneously, tentacles extended in all directions, launching a counterattack against the invisible presence.

However, the Egoist's Incarnation of Killing Intent avoided even that, crossing its arms to strike Zion hard.

As the blade's shadow passed at the speed of sound, the cloak's surface rapidly hardened, leaving a clear X-shaped scar.

Bang! A sonic boom exploded belatedly.

"Grrr!"

Blown away by the shockwave, Zion rolled on the ground as his cloak spread out.

Zion stopped rolling by striking the floor with his gauntlet's blade and looked up at the standing Egoist.

*Mobile object detected. Nervous system relaxed. Automatic defense mode deactivated.*

Though the Armament immediately assumed battle readiness, Zion had already lost the will to fight.

Why would he need to risk his life after putting up 4 billion?

In any case, he had bought the time Arius had requested.

Reading its user's emotions, the Armament activated its mobility-specialized system, and Zion moved like the wind, disappearing from the sight of Shirone's group.

Amy and Reina gave up pursuit and checked on Shirone.

Lying in Arius's arms, he appeared so transparent that objects could pass through him.

"Shirone! What happened?"

Armin explained instead.

"He manifested the Egoist with his last strength. Moving any further is impossible."

"Ah, Mr. Armin, please run away."

"No. We can't get out anyway if we don't catch Arius. Show us the way down. If Ataraxia is grave-robbed, a great disaster will befall us."

Armin laid Shirone on the floor. Then the avatar's outline glowed brightly and the floor melted like chocolate, flowing downward.

"Is Shirone going to die?"

"No. He's descending. The entrance to the 1st stage is Shirone himself."

Amy crawled toward the floor that was caving in the shape of a person. She shouted toward Shirone, who had already descended more than 5 meters.

"Shirone! I'll definitely save you! I will definitely save you!"

Underground darkness crept across Shirone's surface like liquid.

It might have been her imagination, but Amy clearly saw a faint smile appear on Shirone's lips.

And finally, the entire 2nd stage was sucked into the hole.

* * *

Shirone's mental 1st stage. Maternal psychology.

It was the end of the abyss.

Amy, who had fallen down with the scenery, looked around.

It was a horizontal plane with nothing there, but it wasn't dark.

Somewhere, the sound of a beating heart could be heard - thump, thump. It felt like being submerged in water.

"This sound is...?"

Armin appeared from the darkness.

"It's the sound Shirone heard when he was in the womb. This place is called maternal psychology, containing records from conception to birth. In other words, it's where instincts are formed."

"So Ataraxia was in the final stage after all."

At Reina's words, Armin also smiled helplessly.

It had been a journey based only on vague possibilities. But who would have thought that an archangel's ability would really be imprinted in the realm of instinct?

'How did they manage it? Could it be possession?'

Even so, it was too dangerous.

Possession could provide stronger mental exploration abilities than Dive, but the Egoist's backlash would be tremendous too. Even an archangel would risk annihilation if they attempted possession on Shirone in his normal state.

'Well, I can't be certain. If it's an archangel...'

The probability Armin was thinking was 50-50.

No, honestly speaking, he could assert that it was impossible for any being to enter another's mental world and overwhelm an avatar.

But since the subject was an archangel, there remained room for variables.

A being that transcended human abilities by far.

Thinking of what he had experienced when he went to Heaven still made his teeth chatter.

"Let's go for now. Arius's work must be quite advanced."

Reina looked around and said.

"But... where should we go?"

"Just walk. This isn't a space. Mages call it a 'spot'. Since there's no direction, it doesn't matter where you go. To add more, the phenomenon of a mage's Spirit Zone also comes from gathering the mind in the 1st stage."

Amy nodded at this new fact.

The 1st stage was a storage for compressing higher-level concepts.

Since it wasn't a space, its volume was infinite.

She thought that infinity might not be some massive thing commonly imagined, but simply a single point.

Following Armin's words, they walked forward aimlessly. Since there was no change no matter how they walked, it felt like walking in place.

When an object appeared 50 meters ahead, a sense of distance emerged and the 1st stage's scenery changed.

It was a blue garden where refreshing birdsong could be heard, with pure white statues erected randomly.

Since Amy had only seen the great battlefield filled with strange mechanical devices in Heaven, she didn't notice, but Armin immediately recognized them as angelic sculptures.

'Traces of Ikael.'

Armin's group entered the temple built beyond the fountain. The chill of the marble floor brought a refreshing feeling.

They could see an 8-meter-tall angel statue, with Arius and Zion waiting in front of it.

Arius realized who the masked man was.

Though it was his first time seeing the face, among Scale mages who dealt with time and were blind, there was only one person without question.

"Hmm, this is unexpected. I'm sorry for not recognizing someone of your caliber. But I feel a bit uncomfortable about it. Honestly, I never imagined it. That your side would break the 'agreement' first."

Armin pretended not to hear and examined the statue first.

An archangel was smiling with both hands gathered at her chest. Wings wrapped around her body, and a halo floated above her head without any support.

'Is this the materialization of Ataraxia...?'

Armin turned his head to Arius and spoke solemnly.

"The agreement covenant is still valid. I came as one mage to punish a grave robber - it has nothing to do with the organization."

Arius cheekily picked his ear.

"Well. From what I know, your world isn't operated so freely. Anyway, aren't you playing the role of a great mother in the magic society?"

"So? You won't give up grave robbing? You can't escape anyway."

Arius pretended to blow away nonexistent earwax.

"Why would I need to escape? Let me say it again - you have no authority to arrest me. No, never mind. This isn't the time for such arguments."

Arius pointed at the statue and introduced it as if it were his own.

"How is it? Ikael, the Archangel of Amplification. Among her abilities, this is Ataraxia, the super-magic amplification circle known to be the most powerful. I imagined it, but who knew it would be this beautiful?"

"You think we'll just let you take it?"

Zion lifted his chin and said.

"Of course I have to take it. Do you know how much this thing is worth? From now on, I'm the owner of Ataraxia."

"You bastard! A human like you doesn't deserve to live!"

Amy's eyes blazed as she charged forward.

At that moment, her vision distorted and she felt the distance growing farther.

When she came to her senses, Armin was standing beside her.

It had been Flicker magic.

"Why? We need to catch Arius quickly."

Armin launched a Wind Cutter.

The shuriken-shaped wind shattered with a clang at the midpoint. From the collision point, thin electricity spread in right angles.

"It's a mental wave barrier. Divers call it 'string pulling'. It's made by drawing Shirone's mind into strands and weaving them into a barrier form."

Arius clapped his hands with a delighted expression.

"As expected, you're well-informed. The Eternal Contemplator wasn't just a title. Correct. While you were following slowly like turtles, I played around a bit with Shirone's mind."
