Amy shouted with her red eyes blazing.

"You bastard! A thief making barricades with the owner's belongings? If you're a mage too, then fight fair and square! What, are you scared you'll lose to me?"

"Haha! When there's such a difference in our levels, is there really any need for that? Especially when I know you're not in normal condition, Armin."

Arius placed his hand on the statue.

"The rehearsal is over. The reason I waited for all of you before the main performance was because I wanted to share this historic moment with everyone. It will be a spectacle you'll never see again in your lifetime, so please enjoy watching."

When he cast the Scale magic Resizing, the 8-meter tall statue of Ataraxia shrank to a size similar to a chess piece.

As the archangel's statue became a figurine, Zion's eyes lit up.

At that size, it would be easy to carry around. He could use Ataraxia anytime, anywhere.

"Hmm, this should be perfect. Now then..."

"You bastard! That belongs to Shirone! If you so much as touch it, I won't let you get away with it!"

Seeing Amy trembling with rage, Zion felt his spirits soar.

"Haha! What are you going to do about it? There's nothing you can do anyway. Just watch as Ataraxia becomes mine."

Arius grabbed the archangel figurine and made a straining sound as he lifted his upper body.

But for some reason, it didn't budge at all.

He exerted force until his face turned red, but it was useless.

"..."

Arius released the figurine and stepped back.

Then he looked around at the people watching him and burst into embarrassed laughter.

"Hahahaha!"

Why wouldn't it move?

Resizing reduced the scale of space, so it had nothing to do with mass. It was like how a small pebble to a human would be a giant boulder to an ant.

'Yet I can't lift it. Mass that transcends dimensions? No, there can't be a dimension that surpasses Scale magic. Then what exactly is the problem?'

Unable to stand watching any longer, Zion pushed Arius aside and took his place.

"Move aside. What's so difficult about this little thing?"

Arius let Zion try. While the kid's physical strength wouldn't be any different, if it was Armang, he should be able to exert power equivalent to a Schema.

"Honestly, these mages..."

Zion clicked his tongue and bent down.

He grabbed the archangel figurine and gripped his wrist with his other hand, causing Armang to react immediately.

-Muscle enhancement system activated. Energy metabolism rate increased. Muscle fiber reinforcement. Joint flexibility optimization. Ligament tensile strength enhanced. Power center point reset.

"Hnnngh!"

Zion, who straightened his back while gripping Ataraxia, was surprised by the weight that exceeded his expectations.

But he too was overflowing with strength from Armang's muscle enhancement program. He felt like he could move even a house-sized boulder if he wanted to.

Zion straightened his bent knees while pulling his upper body upward.

Finally, the archangel figurine began to lift about a finger's width off the ground.

"We can't let this happen! We need to get in there somehow and take it back!"

Amy shouted, but Armin only observed Zion's movements.

As a Scale mage himself, he could tell. Ataraxia wasn't failing to lift because it was heavy. Some rule other than mass was definitely at work.

'What's happening?'

Zion succeeded in lifting Ataraxia up to his waist level.

"Got it! N-now this is mine...!"

At that moment, a scream-like metallic sound rang out as the surroundings were dyed red. The peaceful appearance of the temple instantly transformed into a dangerous atmosphere.

As the archangel figurine burst with a shockwave, Zion and Arius were blown to where the walls were. Meanwhile, Armin's group was safe thanks to their mental wave barriers breaking and offsetting the impact.

Zion regained his balance with Armang's help.

His pride activated, and as he tried to rush toward Ataraxia again, Arius, who was leaning against the wall, shouted.

"No! Don't get close!"

A magic circle was carved into the floor, and a barrier of light shot up cylindrically to protect the figurine. Then ancient heavenly language began to be rapidly inscribed on the surface of the barrier.

"We need to hurry and get Ataraxia back!"

Reina nocked an arrow and prepared to charge forward. But Armin stretched out his arm to block her advance.

"Wait! That's a sealing formation."

If alchemy developed magic technologically, sealing formations were the result of developing magic spiritually.

While mages didn't accept the binary distinction between good and evil, the religious world had used sealing formations to imprison countless beings they defined as evil.

Arius also realized this was the process of unsealing and tensed up.

'Why is a sealing formation installed in Shirone's consciousness?'

It was impossible to inscribe something without a trace in the prenatal psychology that occurred within the womb.

Even if possession occurred, there should normally be a statue like Ataraxia. Perhaps it was a mutation that occurred when Shirone was in an embryonic state.

But the probability of a sealing formation, which was a logical construct, manifesting at the 1st level of consciousness was lower than the chance of parts scattered by wind spontaneously assembling into a carriage.

The golden ancient language climbing up the light barrier completed its process. As the programming vanished, a passage was written in the center of the cylinder.

Arius quickly interpreted the heavenly language.

'Ra hadamah judran arab, ya ahud min alfoud. O Lord of Chaos, tear down the walls of boundaries. Whatever it is, it won't be something cute. Huh?'

New text was written below the passage.

Due to the nature of sealing formations, the sealer's signature had to be inscribed. It was like the incantations of exorcists saying "I command in the name of so-and-so." Moreover, this was proof that Shirone's security device was an artificial design.

"What...?"

Armin and Arius, who could read ancient language, froze in place.

The line of light, drawn slowly as if written by human handwriting, placed a period next to the designer's name.

The name of the lost one was inscribed there.

McClain Guffin

**Master of the Avatar (1)**

'Impossible! Impossible! Impossible!'

Arius's mind raced at its fastest speed ever. It was an emotion composed of 80 percent excitement, 19 percent fear, and 1 percent denial.

The sealing formation designed by Guffin was definitely a security device to prevent grave robbing of prenatal psychology. There was no other way to explain why it had remained silent until now.

'But why exactly? No, why exactly?'

The 1st level was the genetic level domain. Could Guffin's ruins really be hidden in such a place?

Guffin's works had ended as of 18 years ago. Then when was this sealing formation created?

Arius recalled Shirone's age.

'Eighteen years old. But which eighteen years old? Before the reset? After the reset?'

There was no way to know. But Arius had a thought like blind faith.

'Could it be the reset point?'

The dimensional rift verification experiment proved the discrepancy between time and energy. Though the discrepancy lasted only an instant, it caused the universe to face a rift.

There was no guarantee that Shirone was born from the rift. There was no plausibility, and no evidence to support the fact.

But Arius was gripped by intense conviction.

If Guffin had truly designed the security device, no existing mage would be able to disable it.

But why hadn't he installed it at the 11th level, where external interference was most severe?

'Because he had no choice.'

It was installed in a fetal state, or even an embryonic state.

'Was grave robbing impossible from the beginning?'

No diver other than Arius could break through Guffin's sealing formation.

But he still hadn't given up hope.

'It depends on what comes out of there.'

The being that had been trapped in the sealing formation showed its face above the magic circle.

It resembled a rhinoceros and its skin was gray-white. It was covered in bumpy protrusions so hard that even a blade couldn't penetrate them. It had seven eyes - one in the center and three on each side.

A leg that broke through the sealing formation touched the ground.

As the monster pulled up its other leg and extracted its body, the temple floor collapsed and everything tumbled underground.

Judging the size by just the face had been a mistake. The torso was 100 times larger than the face. Its belly was wickedly swollen, and thousands of lightning-bent horns protruded from its back.

It was as if the angry incarnation of the Egoist that had manifested at the 7th level had appeared in its actual form.

"Damn it!"

Arius cursed and increased his distance.

The demon god Behemoth.

It was the king of beasts that had been active long before human history.

'Even if you like antiques, there should be limits. Just how ancient a relic came out?'

Behemoth was a being that appeared in creation myths even in heaven. Even powerful demons would have to bow 90 degrees to Behemoth, which was why it was called a demon god.

Behemoth, awakened from its long slumber, showed no movement for a while. Then it twisted its neck and stretched its body before looking down at the people with its seven eyes.

"Foolish humans, according to the contract of sealing, I shall destroy you."

Behemoth, having issued the death decree, caused electricity to gather at the tip of each horn on its back.

As thousands of lightning bolts lit up simultaneously, everyone's faces turned pale without exception.

"Damn! We need to get out."

Arius escaped as soon as he opened a door.

Meanwhile, Zion looked at the archangel figurine with regretful eyes. But the moment he turned his gaze to Behemoth's electrical power that seemed ready to burn up space itself, he unconsciously screamed and ran toward the door.

"We need to get out too! Follow me!"

Armin shouted to the two women.

This time, there was no need to think and judge.

A demon god was a Double S-class being by magical society standards. This meant it arithmetically possessed power equivalent to 370 9th-class combat mages.

Even in practical terms, it would require more than 20 6th-class mages, and that was assuming they knew how to attack it.

Moreover, since various variables occurred in actual combat depending on characteristics and combinations, they would need at least 1.8 times the combat power of the practical standard to have any hope of stable suppression.

In other words, a party of this level couldn't even scratch its fingernails, let alone its teeth.

Amy and Reina threw themselves toward the door without any leisure to look back, and Armin immediately cast Flicker magic to follow.

Thousands of lightning bolts intertwined in chains of electrical charge, forming an electric field like a spider web. The bolts that exceeded saturation point spread in all directions, searing the space.

The door, having absorbed the powerful energy, disappeared with a pop.

* * *

Armin's group was catapulted out of the door as if shot from a cannon. Amy and Reina rolled around on the ground, and only Armin managed to barely maintain his balance and land properly.

"Are you alright?"

Amy coughed repeatedly.

"Suddenly, I couldn't, breathe. *Cough*!"

As soon as they jumped through the door, a powerful hot wind had swept from Shirone's mental world. If they had been even a little later getting out, they would have been roasted by Behemoth's bolts.

Arius had already fled, and only Zion remained alone. But he too seemed confused, unable to take any action even when seeing Armin's group.

Amy looked at Shirone hanging upside down in the spider web.

The time barrier hadn't been released yet, but he couldn't endure in this state for long. Eventually they would have to release the barrier, and what would happen next was unpredictable to anyone.

"It looks like the blood vessels are already cut. What should we do?"

"What did you inscribe in Shirone's consciousness?"

Amy shook her head despairingly.

"Nothing came to mind. So I had no choice but to write 'Shirone.'"

"You did well. If you can't establish a specific strategy, something abstract would be more helpful. Because we can use Shirone's consciousness. I'm going to release the barrier now. Prepare yourself."

"B-but...!"

Amy wasn't mentally prepared.

Since they had changed the flow of consciousness, Shirone might instinctively find a solution, but if they failed, Shirone's neck would be severed the next moment.
