"We cannot delay. We need to give Shirone even a little breathing room. The wire is continuously tightening around his throat. If we drag this out, the situation will only get worse."

Amy felt words of opposition rise to her throat but desperately swallowed them down.

Armin was right. If this was going to happen anyway, they had to bet on the side with even slightly better odds.

"I'm worried about Shirone too, but we need to chase after Arius. We'll have to retrieve the timeline he used on Shirone. I'll give you 3 seconds. If no other solution comes up within that time, the barrier will be released."

A timer automatically started in Amy and Reina's minds. 1 second, 2 seconds... No solution emerged.

By the time they reached 3 seconds, they had naturally resigned themselves to fate.

Though it was close to coercion, they were at least prepared to face reality when the time barrier was released.

'Good luck, Shirone...'

After retrieving the timeline, Armin escaped the food storage with Flicker magic.

If they let Arius get away, he would reveal to the world that he had broken the agreement, which would cause international conflict on par with the Ataraxia incident.

Amy and Reina, unaware that Armin had disappeared, focused nervously on Shirone's next situation.

Just as they felt life returning to Zenogger's face, light flashed from Shirone's body. A Photon Cannon with a short diameter exploded once, sending Zenogger flying back.

By increasing the density of the Photon Cannon to deliver an impact close to a physical barrier, Zenogger received a shock as if hit by a carriage.

But he couldn't understand it.

The sensation of cutting through skin still lingered at his fingertips. Being counterattacked after feeling this sensation was a first in his assassination history.

"Sh-Shirone..."

Amy's voice trembled with emotion.

There was no way to know how Shirone had repelled Zenogger. Even if he had changed the flow of consciousness, the casting speed and power were absolutely not something a magic school student could manage.

The spider web binding Shirone burned with red light, then turned to hard ash and snapped apart piece by piece. Shooting a laser at 1-millimeter-thick spider web to conduct heat was also a precision that current Shirone couldn't achieve.

Amy, who had been relieved that Shirone was alive, finally thought something was strange.

But when Shirone fell backwards to the floor with a thud, her mind went blank again as she kicked off the ground and ran out.

"Shirone!"

"Don't move!"

Zenogger, who had been repelled by the Photon Cannon, flew back and pressed down on the back of Shirone's head, restraining his back. Even so, his pupils were shaking, unable to grasp the situation.

'What the hell happened?'

After that instant moment passed, it was as if the world had suddenly changed. The women who had been bound in spider webs were also freed, and their positions were scattered everywhere.

'I was hit by something.'

Zenogger, trapped in the time barrier, had no way to understand the current situation. But his mind, hardened by years of experience, quickly eliminated meaningless variables.

Something beyond perception had simply occurred.

As long as he kept in mind who the current enemy was, he would be the one left standing in the end anyway.

"Zenogger! Kill him! Right now!"

Zion finished his calculations and shouted.

With even Arius having fled, if Shirone survived, he would be left holding the bag. Killing Shirone as well as everyone involved in today's incident was the only way he could plan for the future.

"As if I'd let that happen!"

Amy rushed toward Zenogger.

This time she wouldn't make a mistake. Even if it meant giving up her life, she would save Shirone.

Zenogger's movement was slightly faster. He formed the wire he had pulled from his mouth back into a noose shape and placed it around Shirone's neck.

But just before pulling the wire taut, red light sources gathered around Shirone and high-powered lasers shot out in all directions.

As soon as one beam of laser touched Zenogger's shoulder, it penetrated through the bone.

"Huh? What is this... Aaaagh!"

Amy's eyes widened.

She had seen the power of lasers many times, but this was unbelievably high-powered. Even when Shirone cast at full power, it had never been this strong.

Sensing danger, Zenogger flattened himself against the floor. Then, following insect instincts, he moved his limbs to retreat without taking his eyes off Shirone. He crawled backwards up the wall and wedged himself into the corner of the ceiling that spiders loved most.

When Zenogger failed, Zion decided to finish off Shirone himself. He extended the blades of his gauntlets long and charged in.

"Die! You worthless brat!"

"Your Highness! You mustn't! Please avoid him!"

Despite Zenogger's restraint, Zion didn't stop.

Shirone staggered with his head down, then extended his hand toward Zion approaching from the side. In that instant, a thin laser pierced through Zion.

The reaction came 1 second later.

"Aaaagh!"

Zion tumbled backwards like someone struck by a strong wind, clutching his stomach and rolling on the floor.

He had no idea where or how he'd been hit. He just felt tremendous pain in his abdomen.

â€”Abdominal perforation detected. Cell regeneration capability maximized. Pain-blocking substances injected. Physical capability utilization index decreased by 48 percent. Estimated recovery time 3 minutes 47 seconds. Rest recommended.

"Your Highness! Are you alright?"

Zenogger, crawling over while moving his arms and legs like a bug, supported Zion's upper body. Even so, his left eye was watching Shirone's every move.

As an assassin of the Spatula clan, he had his own manual for dealing with mages.

But such simple magic was a first for him. If it had penetrated the brain, Zion would have died instantly.

Shirone hadn't uttered a single word so far. He was just staggering like a drunk person.

Then after shooting the laser, his body trembled.

He coughed roughly and spat out a handful of bloody water from his mouth.

"Damn, the human body..."

When Shirone slowly raised his face, Amy covered her mouth with a terrified expression.

His pupils had turned pitch black, and nerve-like vessels were protruding red and blue around his eyes and temples.

Amy realized that the expansion of his nervous system had enhanced Shirone's magic.

But it wasn't normal.

She felt the same monstrous quality from Shirone that had appeared in the 1st layer of the depths.

"Shirone, are you really Shirone?"

Shirone didn't answer.

Of course, he was Shirone. He had simply integrated with Behemoth at the avatar stage.

This was different from possession where two egos share an avatar. Integration literally meant they had mixed together.

Though different from pure Shirone, if this was Shirone's avatar, then he was definitely Shirone.

"Answer me! Just who are you?"

Shirone smiled coolly and said,

"It's me, Amy. Don't you recognize me?"

Amy was certain.

The being before her was not Shirone.

"Liar! You're that monster from before! Quickly return Shirone to normal!"

Shirone had a cold disposition. But now it was like looking at an active volcano with lava boiling inside.

Shirone ignored Amy and surveyed ahead.

The only emotion driving him now was rage. A rage that felt like it would explode in his stomach if he didn't vomit it out immediately.

That rage was directed at where Zion was.

Having recovered from his wounds, he had drawn the blades of his gauntlets and finished preparing for battle.

"A mere commoner... You think I'd lose to someone like you?"

Zenogger glanced around nervously and suggested,

"Your Highness, it would be better to retreat now..."

"Shut up! Where would I flee, leaving behind a traitor who inflicted mortal wounds on a prince of a nation!"

It wasn't about confronting him out of pride.

If the incident ended like this, he would have to pay the price for attempting to assassinate Shirone. But if he killed Shirone here, he could instead frame Shirone as a traitor and cleanly cover up the incident.

"Zenogger, distract him. I'll attack from behind."

"Understood, Your Highness. I don't mind dying, so please preserve your precious body."

Shirone looked at Zion and Zenogger indifferently.

But inside, such tremendous chemical reactions of rage were occurring that his consciousness was about to fly away.

"Here I go, Your Highness!"

Zenogger charged in an all-out attack stance.

What he could tell as an assassin was that if he attacked Shirone now, he would die. But he willingly flew toward death.

"Long live Her Majesty the Empress of Theraze! Preserve the Spatula clan!"

Zenogger shot out wire with all his strength.

He didn't even hope for a fatal wound. He just needed to buy time for Zion to realize the reality and flee.

With today's sacrifice, the Spatula clan would be able to continue their lineage.

"Huh?"

There was nothing where the wire extended.

Reaching the spot where Shirone had been standing, he turned around and got goosebumps.

An explosively fast instant teleportation.

Shirone, who had reached Zion, grabbed Zion's throat and charged forward, slamming him into the wall.

"Urgh!"

Zion was suspended a span above ground, being strangled.

Even while suffocating, Shirone's distorted face came into view. His pupils had become even darker, and the prominent nerves around his eyes had extended to his cheekbones.

"Hehehe, found you. So it's you."

Zion's face felt both familiar and unfamiliar.

But it didn't matter to current Shirone. Only the fact that tremendous rage had flared up the moment he saw Zion was important.

As light flashed on the surface of Shirone's pupils, Zion realized for the first time that even darkness could be imbued with light.

His face, receiving the killing intent, turned deathly pale.

Armang had no leisure to pay attention to other strategies, busy supplying oxygen to Zion whose airways were blocked. Also, that was the only instruction Zion was giving.

When Zion was still trembling even at the time he should have died from suffocation, Shirone was displeased. Then he examined the drooping tentacles and raised the corners of his mouth.

"So it's an Objet. Then how about this?"

Shirone's nerves thickened, raising the skin along his arms to his wrists.

His grip strength increased. The capillaries in his pupils burst with popping sounds, and his eyelashes reddened with blood.

'My neck... my neck...'

Shirone intended to break his neck bones.

Despite Armang's physical enhancement abilities, creaking and twisting sounds came from the neck. Zion got goosebumps and wet himself.

"Ze-Zenogger..."

He called desperately, but no answer came back. Judging that there was no possibility for Zion to survive, he had fled to inform the clan that Theraze's retaliation would come.

"Really annoying. It still won't break. No, is my body too weak?"

The avatar combined with Behemoth forcibly expanded Shirone's mind. While magic power increased, it also brought the pain of his brain being torn to shreds.

But suffocating him meant the Objet would absorb oxygen, and breaking his neck bones meant his muscle strength couldn't keep up - it was annoying either way.

Shirone's words approached Zion as terror.

After briefly experiencing something like a near-death experience and coming back, the world looked different. Nothing was more precious to humans than life.

"If you kill me..."

Zion squeezed out his last strength and shouted,

"If you kill me, you won't be safe either! I am the son of Theraze!"

At the same time, Shirone hurled Zion to the opposite side.

Zion, who had rolled on the floor, clutched his throat and made dying sounds. Water and saliva flowed from his eyes, nose, and mouth indiscriminately.

Shirone clicked his tongue while rubbing his wrist. It hurt quite a bit, as if the ligaments were strained.

With his own body, he couldn't break neck bones. While he was quite satisfied in the mental realm, he hadn't paid attention to physical enhancement at all.

When Shirone approached, Zion flinched and trembled.

Having passed the brink of death, his head was spinning dizzy. The reason Shirone had spared him - it was because he had heard the name Theraze.

'Well, no matter how psychotic, he'd be afraid. If he kills me, how would he handle the aftermath?'

Contrary to Zion's expectation, Shirone was neither scared nor thinking seriously. He simply recalled one impressive incident from long-ago memories.

"Theraze. It's been a long time since I heard that name. That woman is quite interesting too. So... what about Theraze?"

"I told you, I'm Theraze's child. If you kill me, mother will chase you to the ends of hell and kill you."

Shirone tilted his head.

"What are you talking about? Were you... a woman?"

"Hmph! I know about the female lineage rule too! But blood is still blood! My younger sister likes me too! If you touch me, all of Theraze's forces will hunt you down."

"Pfu..."

Air leaked out as Shirone's lips vibrated.

"Puhahahaha! Puhahahaha!"
