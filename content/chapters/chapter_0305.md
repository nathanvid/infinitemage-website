When Sirone burst into laughter, Zion's face flushed red.

A lowly commoner was looking down at him and mocking him. Never in his entire life had he experienced such humiliation.

Sirone shook his head, his face still bearing traces of laughter.

"Is that so? A lot of time must have passed indeed. Do you really know nothing at all?"

"What are you talking about?"

"Theraze has no sons. She only gives birth to daughters. You're nothing but Theraze's shell."

Zion's face went blank.

What did he mean she had no sons? Only daughters? Then who was he? No, could there be a child in this world without parents?

Zion grimaced like a wounded beast.

"Shut up! How could someone like you know that? You're insane. You've been driven mad after being devoured by that monster! Who are you to speak so carelessly about our mother?"

"Didn't Theraze tell you? You really must have been a pathetic fool. She's the type who treats anyone properly if they have outstanding abilities, even if they're not her child. I suppose you weren't even worth that much."

"When did you ever meet Mother!"

Zion lost his reason and charged forward.

He had lived his entire life with the pride of being Theraze's son. And now he was being called a shell?

No, these were the ravings of a madman. From the beginning, there was no way such a commoner could have met Theraze, the emperor of the continent.

"I am royalty! A bastard like you has no right to treat me this way!"

The moment the gauntlet's blade swept toward Sirone's neck, a Photon Cannon struck Zion's abdomen.

Zion, who coughed up a bowlful of blood, flew ten meters and crashed into a flour sack.

"Cough! Cough!"

The sack tore open, and flour poured over Zion like a waterfall.

His face, covered in flour and blood, looked like a clown.

Armang reported: Combat disabled.

It was the only information Zion could relate to.

Sirone approached with a Photon Cannon floating above his palm.

"Humans love such things. Kings, bloodlines, lineage, families. But Theraze, whom you believe in and follow, said this to me."

Zion lifted his head with difficulty. He watched the photons floating above Sirone's palm vibrate and grow larger.

Sirone mimicked Theraze's manner of speaking.

"Even if one is royalty, it's merely a bloodline passed down by humans. But..."

Sirone's Photon Cannon grew stronger.

Half out of his mind, Zion seemed unaware that it was magic meant to attack him, staring at the light with a dazed expression.

Sirone raised the Photon Cannon with a cold smile.

"Talent is bestowed by heaven."

The Photon Cannon fell in a fierce parabola. Tears streamed down Zion's eyes as he watched the light's trajectory with a hollow gaze.

A powerful impact shook the food storage. The Photon Cannon, buried in Armang's fibers, crushed Zion's abdomen until his organs tore, only dissipating after expending all its power.

Flour spread in a ring pattern, shrouding everything in thick fog.

Amy and Reina anxiously shuffled their feet, peering into the white smoke screen. A shadow appeared, and Sirone emerged.

Amy couldn't bring herself to speak to him.

Even if this boy was indeed Sirone, the aura emanating from him felt as precarious and unstable as holding a time bomb.

"I'm going up to the surface. You two run away as fast and as far as you can. I'll handle things here."

It was the moment when anxiety became reality.

Run fast and far? Such words could only be spoken when natural disasters like typhoons or earthquakes struck.

"What exactly are you planning to do? Whoever you are, we need to treat your injuries first. That body belongs to Sirone!"

"I am Sirone."

Sirone raised his head toward the ceiling. His cold gaze slowly descended to meet Amy's.

"Are you disappointed?"

Amy couldn't say a word, her breath caught.

Sirone strengthened his mind with immense rage. The sound of capillaries bursting could be heard ominously beneath his skin.

When he cast laser, a flash as thick as a log shot toward the ceiling. As thermal energy accumulated rapidly, the ceiling began to shake.

"Sirone! Wait a moment...!"

"It's dangerous! We have to run!"

Reina grabbed Amy's wrist and ran toward the exit.

As they escaped the food storage, an explosive sound erupted from Sirone's direction.

The two, knocked to the ground by the shockwave, turned their heads while lying down. Massive rocks had fallen, blocking the entrance to the food storage.

The court musician's music became discordant.

As an earthquake struck the Grand Hall, women screamed and collapsed. The men also looked around with frightened expressions.

"An earthquake? Kazura shouldn't be in a seismic zone, should it?"

"Everyone get down! Get under the tables!"

At the guards' shouts, the nobles crawled under tables. Those who secured spots first and those who arrived later fought over space. It looked like cattle fighting.

The earthquake lasted about a minute before stopping.

The nobles, coming to their senses, crawled out from under the tables with sheepish expressions.

Orkamp and Eliza, supported by royal guards, were also pale.

There had never been a recorded earthquake in Kazura's history. An ominous premonition flashed through Orkamp's mind.

The north side of the Grand Hall exploded with a loud crash. Bricks flew in all directions and smoke filled the air.

A few nobles who had been enchanted by the music lost their minds. Fallen to the floor, they flailed their arms and legs meaninglessly.

The first to grasp the situation were the castle guards and the nobles' personal bodyguards.

Realizing it wasn't a natural disaster, the royal guards surrounded the king and queen, while personal bodyguards also moved close to their nobles.

"An attack? What's happening?"

The guards looked around for security chief Ritney Walker. He had been there just moments ago but was nowhere to be seen.

The chain of command fell into chaos.

If it were enemy terrorists, security should be raised to maximum level. But there were too many sensitive factors to make such a decision while ignoring superior orders.

For a while, nothing happened.

The nobles tried not to lose their dignity. Hiding their true feelings, they peered into the hole in the floor.

But when a figure emerged, they fell backward as if they had never maintained composure.

"That's... Sirone?"

Orkamp muttered with a puzzled expression.

The person who had made a mess of the Grand Hall and appeared was none other than Sirone.

He remembered seeing him dance with Reina just an hour ago. But why was he doing such things?

"Sirone, what on earth is this behavior?"

The royal guards blocked Orkamp's path.

"Your Majesty, don't approach. Something's strange."

Even to Orkamp, Sirone's appearance was definitely different from an hour ago. His eye color alone made him seem like a different person, but the most alien thing was his expression.

Sirone didn't make such emotional faces. He who had maintained a poker face calmly in any situation was now grimacing in pain.

"The castle has good durability these days. Humans have developed quite well."

A royal guard took a drawing stance and approached.

"Lord Sirone, using magic within the castle is strictly forbidden...!"

Without even looking back, Sirone fired a Photon Cannon.

The royal guard threw himself aside, rolling on the floor with a defensive technique. Rapid-fire Photon Cannons chased him, scraping the marble floor.

"From now on, no one speaks without my permission. I make the judgments."

That Sirone was serious was proven by his recent attack. If the royal guard's reaction had been even slightly slower, he would have been caught in the Photon Cannon bombardment and had his limbs shattered.

In an instant, the air in the Grand Hall turned cold. The nobles looked around warily while wearing expressions of incomprehension.

For several days, the Sirone they had evaluated was a herbivore. A docile and honest prey, easy to exploit.

But the feeling emanating from Sirone now was savagely fierce, even to nobles who had experienced all manner of trials.

The guards waited for the vice-captain's orders in place of the missing Walker. But someone who had always stayed outside responsibility couldn't make such a momentous decision carelessly.

"Vice-captain, what should we do? Please give us orders!"

The vice-captain rolled his eyes anxiously.

The main forces were stationed outside the inner castle, so even if contacted, it would take time for them to arrive. From the beginning, having an incident in the Grand Hall, the heart of the castle, was abnormal.

"Vice-captain! Orders! Should we activate the mana control device?"

The vice-captain's face contorted.

"You think that's as easy as it sounds, you fool!"

The mana control device interfered with mages' concentration. But its effects didn't distinguish between friend and foe. If activated, their own mages would also be handicapped.

'Damn, what should I do? Should I activate the control device? But to catch one person, render all our mages useless? If something goes wrong, I'll have to handle the consequences. No, where the hell did Walker disappear to?'

Since it concerned the king's safety, he had to consider every possible variable before making a decision.

But the vice-captain, crushed by the burden, ultimately escaped reality and concluded with resentment toward Walker.

"The control device is a last resort. How about leaving it to us instead?"

The vice-captain turned his head as if meeting a savior. Aimar Bosun, Kazura's magic department chief, was approaching.

"Ah, would that really be alright?"

"Our department has been keeping a close watch on Sirone's activities. It seems he's finally shown his true colors. But we can subdue him with our forces alone. With the security chief's permission, may we use magic?"

"Of course. If you would take the trouble..."

Two people were much better than taking responsibility alone. Moreover, since Bosun had tremendous influence in the royal castle, he wouldn't turn a blind eye even if problems arose.

Bosun gave a fake smile and walked toward Sirone. Then one by one, Bosun's subordinates emerged from the crowd of nobles and followed behind him.

"I'll guard your side, Master."

The spot beside Bosun belonged to his closest aide, Mito Ekkashi.

He had a childlike face with a small stature of 153 centimeters, thick eyelids, and fiercely slanted eyes.

Having traveled countless battlefields since childhood, he was a rising star in Kazura's magic department, reaching the certified 6th rank at the age of twenty-three.

Of course, extreme geniuses like Oliver Siena, who reached certified 6th rank at twenty, existed in the world. But such individuals appeared perhaps once a decade even at the kingdom level, so someone like Ekkashi could be called Kazura's future without shame.

"An unexpected windfall, Master."

"Hmm, unexpected events tend to turn into disasters. But this time, I'd say you're right."

Using magic in the royal presence was a grave crime. Moreover, since Sirone had attacked a royal guard and even uttered treasonous words, he had essentially branded himself as condemned to death.

"Well then, what matter has made the first prince candidate so angry?"

Sirone glared coldly at Bosun.

Just an hour ago, he had wanted to slap that man's jaw. But now, he felt no such inclination. He simply wanted to kill him.

"So it's you, the one driving me mad."

Bosun's heart raced at the 100% pure killing intent that could hardly be considered human.

But he didn't yield in terms of presence. Turning his chin slightly, he spoke to the royal guard.

"Escort His Majesty to safety. I'll handle this place."

"Understood. Your Majesty, please go."

Orkamp shook off the royal guard's hand.

He didn't know why Sirone had changed, but if he left, Bosun would kill Sirone by any means. Then his position would inevitably be handed over to Theraze's faction.

"Who said anything about running away? Who exactly is king to you?"

"Ah, my apologies!"

The royal guard who realized his mistake knelt down. In the urgent situation, he had simply followed Bosun's words.

Of course, under different circumstances, it would have been easily overlooked. But considering that Bosun was part of Theraze's faction, it was indeed careless.
