"But Your Majesty, this place is dangerous."

"That too is for me to judge. The Royal Guard need only protect the king. Is that not so?"

"I will keep that in mind. Then let us move to a somewhat safer location."

When Orcamp moved past Bosun to take position on the south side of the Grand Hall, the nobles erupted in fury. Since the king wasn't evacuating, they had no choice but to remain in this place as well.

As the nobles gathered around Orcamp, their personal bodyguards followed their employers.

Magic was a phenomenon that could instantly erase a person's life regardless of their level. Since Bosun had decided to step forward, the nobles had no intention of lending their protective shields to others.

Even so, it was a 4-on-1 battle. The senior officials of the Magic Department, including a certified 4th-grade mage, would surely have a different level of combat power than Zion.

"Seeing you commit such reckless acts, it seems the First Prince Candidate won't amount to much either. After living in the royal castle for a few days, did everything start to look like it belonged to you?"

"I wouldn't take this crap even if you gave it to me. Bosun, was it? In other countries, someone who should be polishing an Archmage's shoes got ahead in life by doing a bit of farming."

Bosun truly burst into incredulous laughter. He hadn't expected to hear such nonsense from such a junior.

Above all, he felt extreme anger at having his specialty of plant magic dismissed as mere farming.

Of course, plant magic wasn't specialized for combat.

While battle mages trained a single element like ice or flame to its limits, plant mages studied various elements and used that as a foundation to change fertilizer combinations or alter cultivation methods to improve agricultural productivity as their main work.

In some sense, it could be said to be the furthest from combat.

However, once a mage reached the level of certified 4th-grade, regardless of which field they chose, they would have at least one specialty capable of subduing opponents.

"The youngster is too arrogant. Well then, this time I'll evaluate your abilities myself."

Bosun rummaged through his pocket and pulled out dozens of seeds, spreading them across his palm. Each had different colors, shapes, and sizes.

"This is my specialty, 'A Handful of Seeds.' It's a comprehensive gift set of asexually reproducing plants that I've improved. They're all mixed together, so I don't know what will come out."

Bosun swung his arm, scattering the seeds.

As he deployed his Spirit Zone, sprouts began to emerge in mid-air, growing rapidly and developing into plants that revealed their individual characteristics.

Three seeds of Kawangkra were the first to reach maturity. The flower's form was a light green sphere, which split open to reveal sharp teeth. As roots grew and grasped Shirone's arms and legs, it flew at him with its mouth wide open.

"Kieeeeek!"

When Shirone exploded a point-blank Photon Cannon, the Kawangkra flowers burst with popping sounds. Though Kawangkra was fierce enough to tear through a viper's hide, a plant's durability was nothing special.

However, the other seeds each safely took root and threatened Shirone with their unique traits.

As the giant plant colony reached maturity, it turned the north side of the Grand Hall into a jungle.

Since Bosun had improved a total of 87 species of plants, the 'Handful of Seeds' had to contain at least 30 different types of plants.

The landscape spread around Shirone could be called a small-scale ecosystem.

The roots of Cocora trees, called killer vines, climbed up the walls and covered the ceiling. Orto fungi that released mind-scrambling gas spread their spores, and in the corners of the ceiling, Killer Flowers that spat acidic mucus bloomed their petals hanging from spring-like coiled stems.

Shirone looked around with interest, turning his gaze here and there.

To think human magic had developed this far while he was trapped in the sealing formation. He could understand why the angels were so desperate for the final war.

"Did you improve these yourself?"

"That's not worth answering."

As the killer plants attacked, Shirone dodged with teleportation. But plants were everywhere.

Bosun skillfully drove Shirone into a corner. As the trees extended their branches, the space to escape gradually began to shrink.

"How's that, the magic of a farmer?"

The sight of trees moving their branches like living creatures was nothing short of grotesque. But if you dug deeper, there was excellent insight gained from nature embedded within.

Plants have no muscles. Therefore, the only path for plants to move is through 'growth.'

Bosun's passive magic called 'Growth Acceleration' could speed up plant growth by up to 100,000 times. This is why plants under the influence of growth acceleration showed animal-like movements.

However, the plants' lifespans were inevitably short.

Kawangkra, with a lifespan of about 10 years, would finish growing and stop activity in 40 minutes under growth acceleration.

Of course, in the case of Cocora trees with an average lifespan of 1,200 years, they could gain over 20 hours of activity time, but since the average activity time of plants mixed in the handful of seeds was at most 2 hours, prolonged battles were impossible.

If growth acceleration created activity, then detailed movements were possible through the active magic of 'Element Mixing.' This involved injecting various elements into plants to trigger specific instincts, which also included photosynthesis.

The principle was similar to how humans perform meaningful actions in response to different hormones.

Growth acceleration and element mixing were called the heart and brain of plant magic for this reason.

Bosun expertly combined the two magics to fiercely pursue Shirone.

Flowers shot acidic mucus, and thorny vines moved as fast as whips.

Since plants moving meant they were growing, the space became increasingly saturated over time.

Only after tree vines intertwined three-dimensionally and eliminated escape space did Shirone stop teleporting.

Vines from the ceiling wrapped around his limbs.

"Now I'll give you my evaluation. It's a failing grade."

Though he said that, Bosun's insides were boiling.

A plant mage's power diminished in environments without soil. But still, this was the prowess of a certified 4th-grade mage. To have come this far against an amateur was completely losing face in front of his subordinates.

"What the hell happened? Did you gain some enlightenment?"

A person couldn't change this much in just one hour. While personality could change if one went mad, the level of magic itself was different.

Shirone tugged at the tree vine wrapped around his wrist. It was impossible to break with a mage's physical strength. Instead, he was scratched by thorns and blood flowed down.

Bosun snorted.

The plant prison was one of the magics he was quite proud of. Not only was its binding power formidable, but wounds from the vines caused nerve paralysis.

"You'd better give up. It's a prison that no one can escape unless they're a Scale mage. If you surrender quietly, I'll show mercy with a comfortable death."

Shirone, who had been looking at Bosun, blinked. Then with a look of realization, he said:

"Ah, Scale magic."

Shirone looked up at the prison's ceiling.

Vines bulging like tendons formed walls like petrified lava. With this much entanglement, the durability would be considerable too. But that made it even better.

"There was such a good method?"

With a smirk toward Bosun, Shirone immediately created a sphere of light before his eyes.

As he opened Immortal Function, the photon density of the Photon Cannon rose dozens of times.

"Graaaah!"

All the nerves running through Shirone's body stood up. Capillaries in his eyes burst, causing tears of blood to flow.

Yet he could remain conscious thanks to the power of Diamond Body.

Shirone realized what he possessed and what he could do with it.

He expanded his mind until Diamond Body's elasticity was on the verge of collapse. Actually, it didn't matter if it tore. If he could produce this much power, he could set aside his life and have some fun.

"Master, we need to finish him now."

Seeing the Photon Cannon that seemed to compress tremendous kinetic energy, Ekkashi spoke. Bosun couldn't disagree.

Using element mixing magic to make the plants hungry, numerous carnivorous species slipped through the tree branches and bared their teeth at Shirone.

"Shirone!"

The Grand Hall doors opened and Amy and Reina entered.

They could see Shirone trapped in the dense forest. His condition was worse than when they'd seen him in the food storage.

His nervous system was protruding outside his skin. It meant an amount of information too much for humans to bear was being transmitted to his brain.

In this state, even if Shirone's personality returned, it was questionable whether normal life would be possible.

"Graaaah!"

Shirone focused all the mental power drawn through Immortal Function solely on divine particles.

As the light's mass increased, the Photon Cannon began to blur. The massive weight was generating gravity that pulled the photons inward.

"Shirone! No!"

Feeling a terrible thrill at the photon compression power incomparable to Shining Impact, Amy heard the phantom sound of Shirone's mind being torn to shreds.

Human minds are fluid but very vulnerable to sudden shocks. Regardless of Shirone's will, if he crossed the limit, he might never return to sanity.

Numerous carnivorous species descended like tree-climbing snakes and opened their jaws toward Shirone's flesh. At the same moment, the light of the Photon Cannon disappeared.

What was born with a popping sound was a black sphere the size of a human head. As mass was compressed to its limit, light couldn't escape and was sucked in.

The symmetrical form of Photon Cannon - Dark Sphere.

"Kieeeeek!"

The radius of the small gravitational field created by the Dark Sphere was 1 meter in diameter. The stems of carnivorous species caught in that gravitational field snapped as they were sucked into the Dark Sphere in an instant, like water droplets through a straw.

Next, the vines grasping Shirone's limbs began bending with creaking sounds.

The vines struggled to resist, then snapped with crunching sounds and were sucked into the Dark Sphere. Then all the plant colonies connected to the vines were torn from the walls and swirled like a whirlpool.

Crack! Crack!

The process of fiber breaking, bursting, and compressing proceeded sequentially until everything was finally crushed into the darkness of the Dark Sphere.

Bosun stared in dismay at the sight of his specialty 'Handful of Seeds' being completely destroyed.

Only gravity could contain light. And that required tremendous gravity to be concentrated.

'Scale magic...'

Shirone was an Unlocker but not a Scale mage. However, by extremely strengthening gravity, the same spatial changes as a Scale mage occurred.

Perhaps all Unlockers might be Scale mages, Bosun thought.

When the Dark Sphere dissipated, the forest that had established itself in the north of the Grand Hall had completely vanished. Only moss clung miserably to the ceiling corners, and a few surviving flowers dripped acidic mucus before falling to the floor.

Bosun moved his stiff neck to look at Shirone. Despite the tears of blood, Shirone was smiling.

"How's that, my Scale magic? Pretty easy, right?"

The moment he spoke, a basin's worth of blood poured from Shirone's mouth. Amy screamed.

Yet Shirone continued laughing as if insane.

It's okay. At least I can still think. As long as I can fight, that's enough. Even now, my insides are burning.

Bosun trembled at his fingertips, unable to control his crushed pride. Even for an Unlocker, wasn't this too much?

Since it was gravity-specialized magic, he probably couldn't fire projectiles. But in terms of defensive power, it was unparalleled magic.

"I'll handle this."

Ekkashi stepped forward with a cold expression.

To distinguish oneself with battle magic, there were largely two methods: invent startlingly ingenious magic that would amaze the world, or truly excel at combat.

Ekkashi belonged to the latter, and though small in stature, his combat sense was recognized throughout the kingdom as a technician.
