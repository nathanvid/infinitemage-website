Shirone looked back at Ekkashi without even thinking to wipe his blood-slicked lips.

"What are you? You think you can step forward despite being just a subordinate?"

"Master Bosun is the person I respect most. You'd better shut your mouth."

"Then you'll have to die too. Bosun is one of the people I hate most in this world."

Like a true combat mage, Ekkashi didn't get swept up by the provocation. He pulled out a club about a span long from his robe and held it in front of his eyes, speaking in a cold voice.

"Spear of Magic Power, Freeze."

As he opened his palm, the club didn't fall but rotated in place. As if receiving centrifugal force, cores extended from both sides, transforming it into a spear longer than his height.

Ekkashi gripped the spear with both hands and whirled it around. Cold wind reached even Shirone.

After performing dazzling spear techniques, he took his finishing stance and aimed the spear. Ice fragments cracked and fell where the blade stopped.

Ekkashi's specialty was ice magic. Among ice mages, he was a typical combat mage who had intensively trained in magical spear techniques.

The magical weapon Freeze was particularly an expensive weapon that any ice mage would want to possess. It had the basic option of 128% magic power amplification, plus an additional 146% amplification specifically for ice magic.

On top of that, at the magic ice point - the spear's blade - there was a special magic amplification of a staggering 280%. It was an overpowered weapon.

Therefore, when Ekkashi cast ice magic on Freeze's blade, he could achieve a magic amplification rate of 554%.

'Quite impressive for something made by humans.'

Shirone carefully observed the ice continuously falling around Freeze's blade.

The ability to freeze the atmosphere was something only someone of Siena's caliber, an authority on ice magic, could accomplish. Even with the help of a magical weapon, Ekkashi's combat power couldn't be underestimated.

"Blizzard Blade."

Ekkashi, who muttered in a cold tone, closed the distance with teleportation.

As Freeze quickly cut through space, the air froze along the line where the blade passed. With cracking sounds, long ice lines like ropes were born and then shattered into pieces.

"It's humiliating to use this against an amateur, but..."

Ekkashi thrust his spear in the shortest distance.

When Shirone cast Photon Cannon, Freeze's blade penetrated it, causing a shockwave to explode.

Both Shirone and Ekkashi retreated simultaneously. Then they both bounced their upper bodies and charged toward each other.

An ultra-close combat unfolded where one mistake would cost a life.

Seeing Ekkashi approaching, Shirone slammed his Photon Cannon into the ground. The impact was enough to shake the ground, but Ekkashi had already risen into the air.

Lying in mid-air, he grabbed the end of Freeze's handle with one hand and swung it while rotating.

Following the spear's trajectory, a ring-shaped ice tube formed. There was red blood staining one point.

As Shirone bent his waist and his back was thinly cut, frozen blood tore through flesh and spurted out.

"Graaaah!"

Shirone kicked off the ground and escaped Ekkashi's attack radius. But he couldn't endure long and collapsed.

The terror of Freeze lay in turning even minor wounds into fatal injuries. Pain intensified as if his back was on fire, and he felt his consciousness fading.

Ekkashi held his spear behind him and watched his prey's condition.

"Your movement is quite good. But still immature. Be satisfied with becoming fertilizer for my strongest legend."

Just as Shirone was about to respond with burning eyes, something rolled toward his feet.

It was Fresh Truffle.

The dessert that had appeared at his parents' meal. That dessert that had hidden a lethal dose of poison in chocolate's sweetness.

Shirone turned his head with a soul-drained face. Bosun stood there with a mocking smile, having kicked the chocolate.

"How about tasting it now? It's quite delicious."

"...I've changed my mind."

Shirone's face contorted like a demon.

"All of you die."

Dozens of laser beams shot from Shirone's body.

No targeting was needed - wherever they randomly scraped along the walls, explosions erupted. The Grand Hall shook.

The nobles were thrown into panic.

Those who had thought only Bosun's faction would die finally realized this place wasn't safe when Shirone began indiscriminate terrorism.

"Damn it! What are you all doing! Hurry up and kill that bastard!"

Personal bodyguards rushed at Shirone. As dozens of swordsmen drew their swords and charged, Bosun's subordinates also concentrated their firepower with their respective specialties.

Shirone cast Photon Cannon while standing hunched over.

As infinite-level heartbeats occurred, pure energy forms that couldn't even show the movement of their barriers occupied space.

The floor where Shirone stood crumbled like a cookie, collapsing into a deep hemisphere. The wind pushed by the light barrier alone sent people sliding to the walls.

But those present were more than ordinary. Though the first surprise attack failed, they quickly regrouped and charged at Shirone again.

Ekkashi led the charge with Freeze.

The wind torn by the spear blade froze like a blizzard and spread behind him. Shirone countered with Photon Cannon, but Ekkashi made a wide detour and instantly captured Shirone's blind spot.

'This ends it.'

Just as Ekkashi swung Freeze, a red flash flickered before his eyes.

"Urgh!"

A thin laser passed by Ekkashi's nose as he leaned back his upper body.

Unable to maintain balance and falling back onto the ground, he looked at Freeze with bewildered eyes. The blade was cut off, and the cross-section had turned into red-hot lava flowing down.

'Damn, what kind of magic is this!'

Light that cuts metal.

Just how much high output power would be needed to achieve such a level?

Mass-enhanced Photon Cannons were ridiculously heavy, while energy-enhanced lasers were eerily sharp.

The guards watching the situation finally realized they had misjudged from the beginning.

From the start, Shirone had designated everyone here as enemies. In that case, allied combat power would inevitably be limited in this place where the highest nobles gathered. It was a typical guerrilla warfare scenario.

A guard who had thought that far asked cautiously.

"Captain, shouldn't we activate the magic control device...?"

"What are you asking me for, you fool! Go and activate it right now!"

Even seeing the guard run off, Shirone indifferently turned his gaze away.

There wasn't much fighting time left anyway. Half his consciousness was already in the afterlife. He couldn't tell if his legs were moving or if his limbs were already torn and he was having delusions.

'I'll kill them all...'

Only murderous intent and rage remained.

If he could kill everyone here, it wouldn't matter if he died now. If he could just soothe this gut-wrenching resentment, there was no need to think about what came next.

"Kuhak!"

Shirone stopped in the center of the Grand Hall, bent his back, and vomited blood.

Even Diamond Body's durability had reached its limit. The process of mental collapse felt filthier than any other feeling.

Immortal Function theoretically draws infinite mental power, but human bodies have limits. This was the end.

As Shirone's movement stopped, people froze as if by agreement. In the silence, stone debris fell from the ceiling.

"End, is it over?"

Those who had been fighting Shirone had anxious expressions as if trapped in a room with a ghost. Their eyes were sunken and their faces glistened with sweat.

"Kill him! What are you doing! Hurry up and kill him!"

The swordsmen who came to their senses hastily readjusted their stances and charged at Shirone. Dozens of swords flew targeting every part of the staggering Shirone.

Shirone quietly waited for the end. And realizing the end had come, he quietly murmured.

"Halo."

Light exploded with a pop, and a halo was born.

The halo born above his head like an angel's drew a perfect circle, ignoring even the creation process. The shocked swordsmen dropped their swords and grabbed their heads.

The nobles weren't shocked by the halo's form. But their thinking was paralyzed in a different sense.

Having seen the power that blew up the Colosseum during the day, it didn't feel real. Then they finally realized.

If Ataraxia was cast here, the royal castle would disappear without a trace. It was the true end.

Ataraxia's integration speed was more than 10 times faster than demonstrated at the Colosseum. The super-magic amplification circle that completed the concept instantly emitted brilliant multicolored light, waiting for the end.

None of the nobles thought of running away.

Even if weak in force, they were people who had climbed to this position with their heads. No one was stupid enough to misjudge reality.

No matter how fast they ran, they couldn't be faster than Shirone shooting Photon Cannon. If even one person left through the door, that moment would be Kazura's end.

"Shirone..."

Amy covered her mouth and burst into tears.

Shirone's staggering appearance was unbearable to watch. Blood vessels throughout his body had burst, blood flowing down, and even his black pupils had turned red like pools of blood.

Shirone, who had reached life's terminus, was actually crying. Hot tears of blood poured endlessly down both cheeks as he made a crying face like a child.

He spoke in a choked voice.

"You... tormented me first."

Amy couldn't bear to watch and collapsed.

"You tried to kill me. Even though I did nothing wrong, you tried to kill mom, dad, and my friends!"

No one responded to Shirone's cry. Though it seemed like an attitude of reflecting on wrongdoing, in reality everyone was racking their brains on how to escape this situation.

Especially Bosun's mind worked faster than anyone's.

He had underestimated Shirone too much. No, that didn't make sense. He had simply evaluated according to facts. If levels improved just from being angry, everyone in the world would be Great Magicians. What on earth had happened to him?

'Even if garrison troops arrive now, it's too late. Where did we make the mistake? Did we really lose? No. Does it make sense for a kingdom to be destroyed by just one person? That can't be. No, it's something that shouldn't happen.'

Bosun moved with a cautious attitude. But when Shirone glared at him with red eyes, he immediately stopped.

Shirone was currently insane and holding a bomb of mutual destruction. Negotiation was the only way to survive.

"Alright, I understand. I get it. Let's talk. First, I apologize for tormenting you. I'll compensate in whatever way. So first, remove the halo and..."

"Kneel."

Shirone said in a harsh voice.

"Everyone kneel. Nobody move. Before I end this, there's something you absolutely must hear."

Bosun blinked, then knelt without hesitation. With the kingdom's fate at stake, this wasn't a situation to be swayed by emotions.

"There, satisfied now?"

Shirone glared at the nobles behind Bosun.

When Bosun turned his head and gestured, they began kneeling one by one.

Even Amy and Reina knelt.

Shirone had seized control with a strategy of mutual destruction. If they created a situation where he had allies, someone would inevitably try to exploit that weakness.

But Orcamp and Eliza thought the opposite.

Shirone had brought down Theraze's faction. He would become the kingdom's proud son and lead Kazura forward.

Eliza approached Shirone with a moved expression.

"Our son, you saved the kingdom. Well done. Come here. How proud mother is of you..."

Photon Cannon flew targeting Eliza's head.

A royal guard kneeling nearby leaped like a beast, embraced her, and fell. When the heavy mass crashed into the wall, a clean hemispherical groove was carved. If it had hit a person, their head would have been blown off.

"Shi, Shirone..."

Terrified, Eliza trembled with a pale face. The afterimage of Photon Cannon still remained on her retina.
