"If you ignore my words one more time, I'll blow everything up."

Bosun realized the situation was far more serious than he had anticipated. Anyone willing to cast magic at their own parents had to be considered insane.

Orcamp quietly sat down next to Eliza. It was humiliating to show such behavior to the nobility, but he had to prevent Kazura's destruction by any means necessary.

'Damn it. How did I build this country up from nothing?'

With Orcamp being the last to kneel, Bosun naturally became the representative and turned to Sirone.

"Now tell us. What do you want to hear? If there's anything you want, we'll do whatever it takes."

"The person who ordered the assassination of my parents. Who was it?"

The nobles glanced at each other nervously. Then they fixed their gazes on one person.

Without looking back, Bosun already knew who they were staring at and raised his hand.

"I gave the order. If you want revenge, go ahead. But... how about ending it with just me?"

"Stop talking nonsense. Do you think I'll forgive you all?"

"You can't forgive us, of course. But think about it rationally. Nobody died anyway. Even if you kill us, can you really fight against Her Majesty the Empress Theraze? Besides, isn't your beloved family staying here as well?"

Bosun immediately targeted Sirone's weakness.

The fact that he was trying to uncover the mastermind behind his parents' assassination while holding a bomb meant they still had value as hostages.

Thinking this might be his last chance, Bosun raised both hands to show he had no intention of approaching and stood up.

"I'll follow your will. Everyone involved in this assassination attempt, including myself, will take legal responsibility. You can take your family and go home. I, Aimar Bosun, a certified 4th-grade mage, guarantee it here and now. So how about we resolve this through dialogue?"

Sirone's expression softened slightly.

Even killing everyone here wouldn't satisfy his anger, but if he destroyed the royal castle, not only his family but his friends would disappear from this world.

"Charge! Charge forward!"

Commotion could be heard from outside the Grand Hall. The garrison that had been contacted and dispatched came rushing in fully armed.

But as soon as they arrived at the scene, their determined expressions turned to bewilderment.

"What, what is this?"

It was a scene beyond imagination. The Grand Hall, the heart of the royal castle, was horribly destroyed.

What shocked them most was the fact that everyone, including Orcamp, was on their knees.

'Now's my chance!'

The moment Sirone's gaze shifted toward the soldiers, Bosun cast Teleportation.

By the time he approached Sirone, he had already drawn a dagger from his sleeve.

'This is my last chance! I have to stab his heart!'

Sirone was shocked to see Bosun charging at him. But Bosun had already steeled his resolve and thrust the dagger without hesitation.

With a squelching sound, the blade penetrated through the resistance of flesh.

Bosun frowned.

Sirone's reaction had been more agile than expected for someone he thought would be in a groggy state. Because Sirone had twisted his body with all his might, the blade had struck his side instead of his heart.

"Damn it."

Sirone couldn't analyze the emotion he was feeling right now.

His rationality flew away and was filled with bestial fury. The foreign sensation of something piercing his body was not just painful but brought tremendous humiliation.

The moment he saw Sirone's eyes, Bosun cast Earth Skin.

Soil began rapidly accumulating on his skin. The durability of Earth Skin cast by a certified 4th-grade plant mage had the strength of rock.

Photon Cannon struck the Earth Skin. Thousands of cracks spread through the earth wall before it shattered into pieces.

Bosun's face was revealed, filled with horror. Blood spurted from his mouth as the shock penetrated through.

"Aaaahhh!"

Sirone writhed in pain, clutching his stomach.

Above his head, Photon Cannon was growing at tremendous speed. People watching the photon sphere reaching one meter in diameter turned pale.

The size gained by abandoning compression was no longer something that could be called Photon Cannon. Gravity Cannon. It was an anti-building cannon targeting structures, not people.

The Grand Hall was in complete chaos. The nobles screamed in terror, their faces drained of color, while the guards consoled their helplessness with meaningless actions of looking left and right.

"Lady Reina!"

Following the garrison, the Ozent family's retainers burst in fully armed. But they too lost their composure upon encountering the scene that defied expectations.

"Subdue the nobles! Right now!"

Reina gave orders to the retainers.

Since shocks strong enough to shake the Grand Hall had been continuously transmitted, the castle interior would be in a state of extreme emergency. If they didn't subdue the nobles now, they would lose even their escape route in the crucial moment.

The retainers approached the high-ranking nobles and held swords to their throats.

As Reina had predicted, troops from each department under command and control began pouring in. High-ranking officers also came running helter-skelter without even properly dressing.

Screaming voices, wailing sounds, voices shouting to kill Sirone, sounds of Reina giving ordersâ€”all these sounds tangled together until they became nothing at all. No one could convey meaning to anyone else; they were just shrieking.

To Amy, it seemed as if they were all laughing. She found herself laughing too.

Faced with an event beyond her capacity to handle, surprisingly her mind settled into calmness.

'If this is the end, what a truly magnificent finale.'

Through the cacophonous noise filling the Grand Hall, a gentle voice reached Sirone.

"Sirone."

Like a lie, silence fell.

Everyone turned to look at the entrance to the Grand Hall. Olina stood with a stern face, holding Vincent's arm.

Seeing Sirone covered in blood with a dagger stuck in his side, Olina felt dizzy and staggered.

Vincent supported her, but she pushed her husband away and walked alone into the Grand Hall.

People made way for her. Her lips trembled as she approached Sirone.

"Don't go."

Eliza's words made Olina stop.

"Sirone is insane. If you go, you'll die."

Eliza hoped Olina wouldn't go to Sirone.

Sirone had tried to kill her. If Olina achieved a different result, her blood pride wouldn't allow it.

"Haaa."

After taking a long breath, Olina turned directly toward Eliza and walked over. Seeing her face, dazed as if she'd been bombed, fire rose up inside her and darkness filled her vision.

Slap! Olina's palm struck Eliza's cheek.

The nobles couldn't believe what had just happened. While no parent could remain rational seeing their child with a knife in their stomach, the person she had struck was none other than the Queen of Kazura.

Eliza couldn't understand what had happened.

When she turned her struck face back, Olina was crying. That was strange too. Why was the person who struck crying instead of the person who was struck?

"What did you do... to my son?"

Pain hit belatedly and Eliza's eyes welled up with tears. It hurt too much.

And that became a major excuse for not having to answer Olina's question.

Orcamp didn't reproach Olina. No, he postponed it for the next opportunity.

There was no doubt she was the one who had stopped Sirone's rampage. Right now, he had no choice but to pin his hopes on her.

"Stop Sirone immediately. Kazura's lineage must not be severed..."

Olina shuddered as if struck by lightning and turned to look at Orcamp with sparking eyes.

Orcamp's eyes squeezed shut at the illusion of a slap coming his way. But the fall of royal authority ultimately didn't happen.

When he opened his eyes, Olina was gripping her own wrist and trembling violently. Then she turned away coldly and walked toward Sirone again.

"Sirone."

Sirone didn't answer.

Seeing Olina's face, everything became frightening like a child who had done wrong. He had caused an irreparable major accident. The irrepressible instinct of a child was to fear disappointing their parents most of all.

When he was young, there had been a few times he'd seen Olina's sharp glare. But today, more than anyone else, she was wearing the most gentle smile.

That made Sirone's heart ache even more. He didn't know why.

"Sirone, do you know how pretty you were as a child? When you smiled, you were as cute as a little girl. Every time, your father would make a foolish expression. Then you would laugh even bigger."

Olina told him old stories.

"You were such a gentle child. Even when something made you angry, you couldn't express it well and couldn't hurt others, so when friends got angry, you couldn't say anything and would come home and suffer in silence."

Olina's eyes became distant. Yes, there were such times.

But already so much time had passed. The newborn who had come like a blessing had grown into such a mature young man.

"But Mom wasn't worried. Being able to understand others' hearts is truly noble. Mom was so happy that you grew up to be such a good person."

Olina caressed Sirone's cheeks with both hands. Her handsome son's face looked particularly troubled today.

"You're so tender-hearted and kind that you don't even know how to get angry. Even when you're so angry, because you can't hurt others, you can only communicate by abusing yourself."

Olina gently embraced Sirone.

"Seeing you hurt so severely, it seems our son was really very angry today."

Sirone's vision blurred. Different from the bloody tears he had shed until now, salty and clear tears flowed down.

His eyes ached warmly. It felt like poison that had risen to his chin was draining out through holes. His chest was so full he could barely breathe. As all emotions rushed to his eyes, words squeezed out like being wrung.

"Mom..."

It was the voice of a lost child desperately calling for their mother in a strange place.

Olina, whose tears burst forth, embraced Sirone's face and stroked his back.

"Yes, my son. Let's go home with Mom. Mom will take you home. Don't worry about anything, let's go."

"Mom... Mom..."

Sirone, overwhelmed with sorrow, panted as he spoke.

"They tried to kill you, Mom. Those people... Mom..."

"It's okay, Sirone. You protected me, didn't you? Mom isn't afraid at all. I wouldn't even be afraid to die for you."

Holding the arms of Sirone who was sobbing like a small child, Olina smiled beautifully.

"Sirone, children are their parents' future. That's why Mom can do anything for you."

The enormous rage that had dominated Sirone until now began rapidly sinking toward the bottom like a collapsing building. The energy of hatred descended endlessly from level 10, to 9, to 8.

The sealing formation of the 1st depth was restored.

Sirone's avatar rose with bright light on the archangel statue. Behemoth emerged from there and returned to the sealing formation. As the pillar of light disappeared, Guffin's security device was released.

Sirone returned to his pure self.

His physical body in reality met a sudden aftershock. His consciousness flew away before he could even feel pain. As his eyes slowly closed, the Spirit Zone vanished and Ataraxia disappeared.

Olina sat down with her collapsing son.

Though she could die for her child, she couldn't save her child. She looked back at the enemies who had tried to kill her son and said:

"Please save our son. I beg you."

No one affiliated with Kazura stepped forward. But Amy and Reina moved swiftly.

First they confirmed Sirone was still breathing. He might be brain dead, but the biggest problem was blood loss. Without a transfusion immediately, he wouldn't last even an hour.

"Amy, I'll take Sirone. You go ahead with the retainers and help prepare for surgery. We need to start with a transfusion, so please accompany us, Mother, and tell the doctor his blood type."
