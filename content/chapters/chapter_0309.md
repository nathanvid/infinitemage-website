After giving the order, Reina put Shirone's arm over her shoulder and stood up.

With Ataraxia gone, the nobles would rise up in revolt. However, since the highest-ranking nobles were being held down by their attendants, there had been no major disturbances yet.

Even so, there was someone blocking her path. It was Bosun, who had stabbed a sword into Shirone's abdomen.

Reina spoke in a cold voice.

"What do you think you're doing? The battle is over. If you don't stand aside, we'll cut off the heads of the nobles we've captured."

"Bo, Bosun! Quickly stand aside. Just let them go for now!"

"That's right! Hurry and stand back! Stand back, I say!"

The nobles with swords at their throats urged Bosun on.

But Bosun didn't move an inch. Even if all the nobles in this place died, he couldn't let Shirone live.

The world is divided by force and intellect, and humans are separated into wolves and sheep.

If Shirone had been a gentle sheep, even with the ultimate intellectual power of an archangel, they could have kept him alive and used him as much as they wanted.

But Shirone was not a sheep. Even if it was an impulsive situation, someone who could be prepared to blow up an entire castle would be more dangerous in the future.

'Today's incident has definitely split the castle's factions. If Zion doesn't become king, it's all over.'

Even the Theraze faction within Kazura, except for Uorin, were mostly Zion's subordinates. He couldn't think that Theraze would show mercy to the defeated prince.

"How about we negotiate instead?"

Amy was dumbfounded by Bosun's shamelessness. Who was it that had drawn his sword first just moments ago while talking about negotiation?

"How can such words come from your mouth? Get out of the way quickly!"

Bosun hadn't asked with any expectation that they would agree. But right now, he needed to buy time.

Shirone's condition was already half-dead. In a situation where every second counted, the most frightening weapon was time itself.

Reina saw through Bosun's strategy. But she couldn't decisively order the nobles' heads to be cut off.

Bosun had already designated Shirone as the strongest enemy in history. So if they killed the nobles, Shirone would die too. From her position of having to keep Shirone alive at all costs, she had no choice but to seek another method.

While Reina and Bosun glared at each other, a strong wind rushed in from the entrance of the Grand Hall. Making sounds like fire burning, figures in black clothes flew in like a swarm of bats.

Thirty silhouettes landed in the center of the Grand Hall. They all wore owl masks and had swords of identical length and specifications at their waists.

Seeing the inverted triangle badges on their collars, the nobles opened their eyes wide and mouths agape in disbelief.

"That, that is...?"

It was the Windstorm Guard, Empress Theraze's direct escort unit.

A full hundred swordsmen who had sworn knightly oaths to Theraze. While it was rare for all members to move at once, it was known that when they appeared, everything in sight would disappear.

"Why is the Windstorm Guard here?"

The Windstorm Guard was not an army. As Theraze's swords, they would never move without the Empress's orders. Moreover, no matter how fast they were, the distance from Kashan was too far to have come in anticipation of today's events.

The Windstorm Guard, forming a triangular formation, looked straight ahead with perfectly aligned postures without the slightest deviation. From the center of the formation, a chilling voice leaked out.

"As of this moment, we take custody of Shirone. Furthermore, we revoke all decision-making authority regarding Kazura Kingdom's internal affairs. Keep in mind that any violation will mean war with the Kashan Empire."

The nobles murmured among themselves.

Revoking internal authority meant stripping all the nobles present of their power. They waited to see if someone would object or raise an issue, but only silence continued.

Realizing that no one had the courage to step forward, the nobles bowed their heads in unspoken agreement.

"We will obey your command."

They could not oppose a decision made by Kashan's ruler.

The Windstorm Guard was Theraze's sword. Their very presence proved that Theraze's directive would not end as a mere threat.

"Please wait a moment. Are you truly saying this is the Empress's decision?"

Bosun raised an objection.

Of course, like the other nobles, he wasn't refusing Theraze's command. However, there were suspicious aspects.

Zion had not yet been defeated. Shirone was hovering between life and death, and if they just stalled a little longer, he would die on his own. It was an incomprehensible decision to make a preemptive move when they could easily take Kazura.

Most importantly, the Windstorm Guard, who guarded the Empress 24 hours a day, couldn't have arrived at Kazura this quickly.

"I've heard that the Windstorm Guard wears owl masks and bears inverted triangle badges on their left chests."

Someone from the Windstorm Guard spoke.

"...What are you trying to say?"

"I'm saying they're easy to impersonate. Transferring governing rights is a major affair of the kingdom. If you received orders from Her Imperial Majesty, you would have brought official documents. Can you show them to us?"

The nobles looked at the Windstorm Guard.

Come to think of it, Bosun's words weren't wrong. While following Theraze was natural, shouldn't they verify whether it was really Theraze?

"There are no official documents. Orders will come down."

"Hmm, that makes it even stranger. How can we trust you and hand over governing rights? Do you perhaps have any proof of identity?"

"We have something like that."

"If it's not too presumptuous, may we see it?"

The Windstorm Guard's triangular formation converged toward the center, forming a straight line. It was as if thirty people had been absorbed into one.

That one person then flew forward, creating afterimages as if splitting into hundreds again. As they rotated around Bosun as the center, a black storm arose.

"Gugh!"

The first sword entered under Bosun's jaw and struck his face vertically upward. As his face flew skyward, thirty swords sliced Bosun's body without a single collision.

The cutting speed was so fast that the air vibrated like a bee's wing beats.

The Windstorm Guard, having delivered nearly a thousand cuts per second, flew their bodies in sequence and landed precisely in their original positions. The formation was a triangular array without the slightest error.

The nobles looked at Bosun with dumbfounded expressions. No, could that thing still be called Bosun?

His body had been dismantled into pieces smaller than fingernails. Blood slowly seeped out from under the minced meat. Something that had fallen from the air stuck with a wet sound.

It was Bosun's face.

Though there were no eyeballs, anyone could tell it bore an expression of shock. The face, mouth wide open, shrank as it soaked in blood.

"There is no one in the world who can impersonate the Windstorm Guard."

The nobles could not object. Their current skill was perfect proof that they were the Windstorm Guard.

Indeed, the Windstorm Guard's tactics were impossible to imitate. Because they had to perfectly mimic the movement of wind, individual skill had to be at the highest level, or they couldn't even attempt to copy it.

Those who implemented fluid dynamics with human bodies.

A hundred such masters becoming one stream of wind and executing perfect tactics - that was the Windstorm Guard, the world's strongest swordsmanship group.

"Master Bosun!"

Ekkashi ran over with bulging veins.

Kneeling before Bosun, who had become minced meat, he tried to touch the facial skin with trembling hands, then glared at the Windstorm Guard.

"You bastards...!"

How could they be so cruel?

Even if he had doubted Theraze's sword, Bosun was also someone who had struggled hard to make Zion king. He wasn't someone who deserved to leave this world in such a miserable state for just one wrong word.

Ekkashi gripped his broken Freeze. But soon he found himself looking at them with terror-stricken eyes.

An indescribable black aura rose from the Windstorm Guard's triangular formation. It was a vision only Ekkashi could see. His brain, exposed to thirty people's killing intent, was creating an illusion of death.

'I have to fight. For Master Bosun...'

It felt like his heart was hardening. With a clattering sound, Freeze fell, and Ekkashi put his hands on the ground and vomited up everything in his stomach.

"Ugh! Ughhh!"

The Windstorm Guard didn't even spare him a glance.

They had received orders from Theraze to handle things moderately and return, but it wasn't their fault. They had responded appropriately to such pathetic killing intent. They couldn't help that Ekkashi's level was much lower than expected.

'Foolish fellow.'

The report had stated he was a promising 6th-grade mage in Kazura. But due to the nature of 6th grade, where advancement points increased more than tenfold compared to 7th grade, the skill gap was also greatest at 6th grade.

'Even considering that, he's weak. There must have been some trick.'

Since Kazura had weak magical power, the state might have pushed him forward. For example, concentrating points earned through cooperation with other mages onto Ekkashi alone.

Anyway, Ekkashi's journey as a combat mage was over. Having been poisoned by the Windstorm Guard's signature group killing intent 'Gaksi', the fear of death would follow him for life.

With Bosun dead and Ekkashi collapsed, the nobles naturally withdrew. The personal guards who had watched Ekkashi fall on his own couldn't even dare show fighting spirit.

When the surrounding cleanup was finished, the Windstorm Guard moved again. Each individual fluttered like particles of air, then flew toward Shirone.

Reina, who was supporting Shirone, trembled with fear in the black storm. Like whispers of wind, the Windstorm Guard's words could be heard.

Voices speaking one syllable each made her mind hazy.

*We will take Shirone. The continent's greatest expert will treat Shirone. We will return him by tomorrow morning.*

With sounds of strong wind blowing inside her eardrums, the Windstorm Guard moved away. Then, as if riding rapids, they made a large detour around the Grand Hall and exited through the door.

The people gathered here today could confirm the movement of wind with their eyes.

**The Wheel of Causality (1)**

"Huff! Huff!"

Arius ran through the inner castle's garden. It was deep night and he couldn't see an inch ahead, but with Spirit Zone, he wouldn't trip over grass roots.

But even one of the Seven Deadly Sins had an ordinary heart. With his breath rising to his chin, he stopped running and cast Flicker.

After blinking, he appeared in a completely different place from where he intended to go.

Having fallen off-center, he curled his aching back like a shrimp and rolled on the ground. It was already his twentieth failure.

"Damn it! Damn it!"

The inner castle's timeline was subtly twisted. It was probably an error of about 1/100,000th of a second, but it was fatal for Flicker magic, which required highly sensitive design.

'That bastard is chasing me.'

Armin of the light eyes.

He hadn't heard confirmation, but if it was a blind time-series mage, it was definitely that guy.

Now there were two methods left. Run and climb over the castle walls, or break through Armin's time distortion.

But the latter method wasn't a good choice. If he made even the slightest mistake, he would appear in a place completely disconnected from his escape route.

The magic control device wasn't operating yet, but various magical traps were installed in this place where the king resided. If he hadn't memorized the routes five years ago, he wouldn't have been able to find even this current path.

'Let's run. I won't stop breathing just because it's troublesome.'

Arius chose the physical method. Shaking off Armin was something to think about once he reached the inner castle gate.

Once he escaped Kazura, the world would turn interesting.

Armin had violated the agreement. When this fact spread, even the Black Line mages in that madman's territory would have no choice but to unite.

A bloody wind would cover the continent.

'That would be interesting in its own way, but...'

More captivating to Arius than a turbulent world was the thought that he had discovered traces of Guffin. What countless scholars had failed to find despite searching the entire world was in the depths of one boy.
