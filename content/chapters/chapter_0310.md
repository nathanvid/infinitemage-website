'What's going on? Archangel Ikael and Guffin. Could there be some connection between the two? Or is it just a simple coincidence?'

It was definitely related to the reset. Once he escaped the castle, he would need to research this matter.

If the reset was real, there was a high possibility that traces remained in other people's depths as well. He would kidnap and dissect them indiscriminately.

He began to slow down as the inner castle gate came into view. Guards carrying torches were patrolling the castle walls.

Arius cautiously attempted Flicker. With a crackling sound, he disappeared and reappeared thirty centimeters ahead. The time distortion had vanished.

'Did I shake him off?'

Armin had spent quite some time in the food storage, so finding his exact location would be difficult. The only method would be to expand the Spirit Zone and distort the entire radius.

Moreover, considering how short his timeline had been, there was a good chance he had already escaped.

"But somehow I feel uneasy about this."

Arius carefully observed the guards' movements.

Realizing there would be a gap in the security perimeter for about two minutes, he waited for the timing and then kicked off the ground, running forward. If he could break through the wall with Flicker, everything would be over.

'Go to hell, you damned Kazura.'

"Where are you going in such a hurry?"

Arius's running came to an abrupt halt.

The voice came from behind him. If he couldn't even sense their presence, this was someone of considerable skill.

'Damn it!'

Arius turned around with tediously slow movements. If he tried to do something clumsily, his head would be severed.

Kazura's security captain, Ritney Walker, was hanging his longsword downward and grinning like a beast.

'This is the worst situation.'

Of all people, it had to be that man.

Kazura may be weak in magical power, but their swordsmanship level was not inferior. Moreover, Walker was the swordsman most faithful to the orthodox methods of the Great Magician War.

The best strategy for a swordsman facing a magician is 'cut them down before they can use magic.' And Walker was the swordsman who performed this best in Kazura. This was content he had read from the elementary court swordsmanship manual that Walker had written.

Walker planted his longsword in the ground and looked up at the night sky.

Even though he had turned his gaze away, Arius couldn't move. It felt as if Walker's nerves had flown over and bound him like a snare.

"It's not the time for people to be wandering around. Even the taverns close their doors on nights like this."

"Haha! I had an urgent appointment. By the way, what brings the security captain here? Are you on patrol?"

"Heh heh, what's this, professionals trying to fool each other?"

Walker's pupils gleamed like those of a nocturnal beast.

"You're a grave robber, aren't you? Arius of the Seven Deadly Sins."

"I don't know what you mean. There are plenty of people named Arius, aren't there?"

Walker belonged to neither Theraze's faction nor Orcamp's faction. He was someone who worked solely for the kingdom's prosperity.

He had been tracking Arius for a long time.

The Seven Deadly Sins weren't important to him. For Kazura, which was weak in magical power, it would be an unavoidable choice. But if they disturbed the kingdom, he couldn't just leave them alone.

"Do you know what's more frightening than a tyrannical king? It's corrupt officials. I'll give you a choice. Either surrender quietly, or be split in two by my sword."

"I wondered why things were going so smoothly."

Arius, revealing his true nature, slowly lowered his hands.

If he acted without thinking of escape, Walker wouldn't move either. This was wisdom gained from long experience.

The reason a magician equipped with teleportation can't escape from a swordsman is due to the human time it takes to activate.

Once magic is activated, a swordsman cannot catch up to a magician. But when it comes to phenomena occurring in the human realm, a Schema master's senses far surpassed those of magicians.

How swordsmen capture the moment when a battery is installed remains a mystery to magicians. According to swordsmen, they say they can feel the temperament changing, so from a magician's perspective, they just have to accept it.

Arius watched Walker's every move. From Walker's perspective, it was no different from an ordinary person staring at him, but since he wasn't a third-rate magician, he had gained some information. Walker's momentum was like a volcano on the verge of eruption.

Arius let out a sigh with a dejected expression.

"Sigh. How annoying."

With a crash, a longsword was embedded where Arius had been standing. Walker appeared in the finishing stance of a vertical slash, as if he had followed slower than his sword.

"Damn it...!"

Arius was gone. Half a beat too slow.

No, even that couldn't be certain. The timing had definitely been accurate.

Speed of cognition, speed of senses, speed of nerves, speed of action. Everything had transcended his opponent. He could assert that Arius hadn't even seen his movement. Probably a gap as wide as the difference between time as felt by humans and time as felt by mosquitoes had occurred.

'But how did he escape?'

First, it wasn't movement-type magic. Nor was it Flicker either. He could only think that he had simply vanished.

Invisibility magic? Even if that were the case, faster casting speed didn't make sense.

But since it was a possibility he couldn't ignore for now, Walker looked around.

"Captain! What's happening?"

The guards came running after hearing the explosive sound.

"From now on, we're searching for Arius. Strengthen the inner castle perimeter and assemble all standby forces."

"A-Arius? Isn't he His Majesty's technical advisor?"

"Sedition charges. If we delay, it'll become more difficult, so move quickly."

The guards scattered in perfect order.

Walker observed his subordinates' movements and then entered the forest. If invisibility magic had been cast, there should be traces somewhere.

After everyone had left, Flicker magic was cast. Like a ghost, a man revealed himself. It was Armin.

"Apotosis. A rational judgment."

Apotosis was known to be among the most difficult of the micro-space Scale magic. And for good reason, as it was magic that involved diving into one's own mind.

When the body enters the mind, the boundary between thought and reality crumbles, turning one into a conceptual being. Without emotions and unable even to think. The possibility of Arius returning on his own power was extremely slim.

'Better than dying, I suppose.'

Definitely better than dying.

Every magician has at least one ace technique.

Indeed, Walker's reaction had been flawless. But Apotosis was feedback from the Spirit Zone, so it had virtually no casting time compared to other magic.

The reason Armin had released the time distortion was to prepare for the case where Arius might be captured by Walker. Death wouldn't matter, but if he were captured uselessly and revealed various matters, the situation would become complicated.

'No need to worry for the time being.'

There was no way he would have attempted Apotosis without even a method to return. He must have made an agreement with someone or prepared some device for such situations.

One year, or ten years. Perhaps he might not return even after a hundred years. But it was certain that he would return someday.

'A collaborator is more likely. I should investigate starting from there.'

The most likely candidates were the Seven Deadly Sins.

Thinking of the members' faces, Armin frowned. They were humans so mentally deranged that Arius could be considered among the more decent ones.

'Shall I depart now?'

Armin looked back at the castle.

He wanted to watch over Shirone a little longer, but there was no more time to delay. He had to return to Caira as quickly as possible.

As he cast Flicker magic, his form disappeared with a crackling sound. Walker's shouting voice drifted faintly over the empty space.

* * *

Zenogger was running through the underground emergency escape route.

Every ten steps he took, a trap activated. Traps where the floor opened, traps where arrows flew, traps where nail-studded logs swung like pendulums.

Zenogger avoided the traps without reducing his speed. When the floor opened, he leaped over it, and the nail-studded logs were caught in spider web nets spewed from his mouth and stopped at the midpoint.

"Haa! Haa!"

Leaning his back against a corner of the underground maze, he took a brief rest. Sweat dripped from his forehead as he looked up at the ceiling.

He couldn't save Zion. That's why he fled. Theraze wouldn't let an assassin who failed his mission live.

If it were only his own death, he could accept it readily, but the entire Spatur clan, which depended entirely on Theraze's support, would disappear as well.

'I have to escape. And find a power to rely on.'

It was a clan that had been assassinating for a thousand years. Though they might not meet Theraze's standards, there were plenty of powers that would need them.

Zenogger recovered only his basic strength and ran through the maze again. He had to escape the castle before dawn by any means.

The floor opened downward like a hinged door with a clatter. Using his spider senses, he leaped just before falling, attached spider silk to the ceiling, and flew in a parabolic arc. At the same time, a dagger flew toward his face.

"Ugh!"

He twisted his waist while in pendulum motion to avoid the dagger.

Though it was something meant to be thrown by a person, the dagger flew as fast as an arrow and embedded itself in the wall.

Landing on the ground, Zenogger immediately took a defensive stance. His torso swelled as four arms popped out, and six pupils opened at his left and right temples.

"Who are you? Come out."

From a corner hidden in darkness, a woman with a small build turned around.

Black bob hair with bangs neatly arranged in a straight line. Her face had eyes gently squinted shut, and despite being an assassin, she wore a straight-line dress with a narrow skirt. It was like wrapping paper that enveloped a person rather than clothing.

Her two hands, modestly clasped together, held a dagger's sheath and handle, with the blade half-drawn.

"A hitman? Who hired you?"

"There is nothing to tell one who is about to depart this world."

It was a refreshing voice that cleared the mind just by listening to it.

But it couldn't fool Zenogger's ears. It was a voice altered through tremendous training.

"Heh, well... that's how we all live."

The moment Zenogger finished speaking, the dagger flew.

Zenogger, who leaped to the ceiling, scattered spider webs in all directions. After changing the environment to his advantage, he whipped steel wires as thick as fingers like whips.

The woman's figure appeared to multiply, then seemed to move along rails as she instantly circled behind his back.

'Unique footwork.'

The narrow straight skirt was absolutely unsuitable for combat no matter how he thought about it. Even stretching her legs to the maximum, she could only manage about half the stride of a normal person. The strange sandals worn between her toes were also bothersome.

But her walking speed was unimaginably fast. Moreover, the acceleration sections were incredibly dense, creating a bizarre movement that felt like chasing afterimages.

At first, she seemed to move slowly, but short distances were explosively added together until she was suddenly right in front of him. Truly troublesome. Since it wasn't ordinary accelerated motion, he couldn't time it accurately.

'The sense of rhythm is completely different.'

This must be how she made her living.

Categorically speaking, she belonged to the circus type. The general term for hitmen who used tactics that deceived opponents using athletic ability.

A momentary curiosity about who she might be crossed his mind, but it was only a fleeting thought. For an active assassin to have their name known was tantamount to being finished.

Zenogger used spider webs to create a curtain and block her approach. As he got used to the rhythm, he began to gradually predict her movements.

From that point, the tide of battle reversed.

Zenogger jumped between walls like a spider and approached the woman.

Daggers flew in off-beat rhythms, but he no longer wavered. He caught the final dagger in his mouth while twisting his neck.

"Heh heh heh! Not bad for a circus act."

Zenogger, who had penetrated into the woman's embrace, raised his upper arms in a reverse joint motion. With the hand that came over her shoulder, he grabbed the woman's face and pushed forward, slamming the back of her head against the wall.

Following a thudding sound, cracks spread across the woman's face with a splitting noise. Fragments of porcelain-like skin fell to the floor.

Zenogger moved his three left hands quickly. With one hand, he strangled her neck while inserting the hand below into her skirt. There were no genitals.

The middle hand grabbed and tore at her breasts. The silk-like clothing was torn away, revealing a squishy cushion-like texture similar to fat.

Her exposed chest was flat, and below, her emaciated ribs were visible.
