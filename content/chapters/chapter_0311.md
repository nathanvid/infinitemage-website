"I knew this would happen."

As the woman tried to break free by thrusting her head forward, Zenogger mercilessly slammed the back of her head against the wall.

Dull sounds erupted in succession as the porcelain skin covering her face completely fell away.

It was the hideous face of a man. No, externally, it was impossible to distinguish gender.

There were no eyebrows and no eyelids. Only the eyeballs embedded in the eye sockets moved left and right.

"Kekeke, a face specialized for disguise? You're as hideous as I am."

The unidentified assassin spoke in his own voice for the first time.

"Ah, this must be your first time seeing me. I've seen your hideous appearance to the point of being sick of it."

Zenogger's expression crumpled.

It was the same line he had said to Arius before. In psychological warfare, one mustn't waver.

But a sudden thought flashed through his mind. Every child of Theraze must have one bodyguard accompanying them. However, he had never seen Woorin's bodyguard until now.

"No, that can't be. You didn't get caught by my senses? Where exactly were you hiding?"

The assassin spoke again with a modulated voice.

"What are you talking about? I was always behind you."

Zenogger's face turned pale.

He knew exactly who owned this voice. It was the nameless administrator who had delivered orders under Zion's command.

'Damn it! That's how it was!'

Specialization in disguise, unique footwork, the line he had said to Arius.

Considering all the circumstances, it was definitely an assassin sent by Woorin.

'Stay calm. His combat ability is below mine anyway. I can't fall for psychological warfare.'

Zenogger used his six hands to suppress the areas where his opponent's strength was amplified. There was no way for the frail assassin, who had burned even his muscles with fire for disguise purposes, to escape.

"From now on, answer what I ask. If you lie, I'll tear off your limbs. Does Woorin know where the Spatur clan is hiding?"

"...Yes, she knows."

"Really? Tell me where. Answer quickly! There's no way you, as her direct bodyguard, wouldn't know!"

"The Undulating Mountains. The Valley of True Names."

Zenogger felt his heart sink.

The fact that Woorin knew their hideout meant she had already sent a subjugation force. By tomorrow morning, the Spatur clan would disappear from history.

"Give up. Even if you escape from here, there's nowhere that will accept you."

"Ugh... Ugaaaah! Shut up!"

Zenogger didn't give up.

If the clan was to be massacred, he had to survive all the more. If it ended like this, where could the value of the clan that had given up being human for a thousand years be found?

"Die! Damn bastard!"

Zenogger raised his left center arm and pointed his hand sharply. Then, like a spear, he swiftly pierced the assassin's solar plexus and grasped his heart.

As the heart burst, the assassin's body flinched. His shocked eyes shook violently.

* * *

Crash!

One of El Crawchi's porcelain dolls lined up on the shelf broke. The body rolled down below the shelf, making a second cracking sound.

Woorin, who had been sitting at the table, blinked slowly as if she hadn't heard. Then she walked to the cabinet and took out strong liquor.

After filling a crystal glass halfway and returning to the table, she sat in the chair, crossed her legs, and fell into thought while gently swaying her white calves.

"Hmm..."

A porcelain doll had broken.

That meant another life had disappeared.

The crystal glass gently parted her cherry-like lips and entered. The transparent liquid flowed down, moistly wetting her tongue, then withdrew.

"What a truly boring night."

* * *

Zenogger glared at the assassin with terrifying eyes.

He had killed countless people, but this was the first time he had encountered something beyond his realm of understanding. He had stabbed the solar plexus and burst the heart. Even now, he could feel the heart cooling in his hand. But why...

"Aren't you dying?"

"I died, once."

Zenogger accepted the assassin's words at some point between understanding and insight.

Curiosity flashed briefly, but it was a momentary thought. Someone about to leave this world didn't need to know anything.

"So you're an Assassin."

"People don't do the killing."

The assassin swung his only free left hand. A flash streaked across, and with a thud, Zenogger's head flew off.

"Situations do the killing."

Watching Zenogger's head bouncing on the floor, the assassin pulled out Zenogger's arm that was embedded in his chest. Zenogger's body, which had fallen to the floor, glowed roughly before a fountain of blood spurted from the cross-section of his severed neck.

The assassin felt no emotion whatsoever. Even if he had any emotions, his face couldn't express anything.

El Crawchi, the doll maker.

Very few people knew that he, who had been active 200 years ago, was obsessed with black magic.

During the time when he was receiving public attention for his technique of seamless joint dolls, a woman came to see him.

Surprisingly, the visitor was Theraze, who ruled the continent.

The two had many conversations, and the day after Theraze left, Crawchi died. At least officially.

Hundreds of celebrities flocked to the funeral. But while they were shedding tears, Crawchi was on a small ship heading to some eastern country.

Following Theraze's instructions, he arrived at the family of puppeteers. Having already been well-versed in black magic, he quickly mastered the puppeteer's techniques.

How to imbue dolls with spirit. How to create the perpetual motion engine that demons supposedly taught. How to install the engine in a dead body, and so on.

Crawchi mastered all the processes and left the East.

When he returned home, a full 180 years had passed. However, having already modified his own body into a doll, he couldn't die even if he wanted to.

The first thing he did was collect his old works. Only dolls made with the puppeteer's soul could have life dispersed into them.

But most of his works had been sold, so only a few could be recovered.

At that point, Theraze gave her first order. To serve her daughter, Woorin.

Woorin liked Crawchi, and from then on, she began collecting El Crawchi's porcelain dolls.

"Princess Woorin, it's me."

Crawchi knocked on Woorin's door.

For an assassin capable of infiltrating anywhere, it was unnecessary behavior, but today, he should properly pay his respects.

"Come in."

Crawchi slowly opened the door and entered.

He could see Woorin leaning her arm on the chair's backrest, sipping alcohol. As if intoxicated, she welcomed him with a seductive smile he hadn't seen before.

"Well, what's the matter, coming all the way to my room?"

Crawchi laughed pleasantly. However, since he had no muscles to show expression, it was an amusing joke that he couldn't convey.

"I've eliminated the Spatur mongrel, Princess Woorin. No..."

As if kneeling wasn't satisfactory enough, Crawchi knelt and prostrated himself on the ground.

"Empress Theraze."

Woorin chuckled and looked out the window. Though the surroundings were still dark, signs of dawn were visible.

"You're quick to notice."

Crawchi shook his head and confessed honestly.

"To be honest, I didn't know until yesterday. I realized when Pungjang arrived. To deceive even me, who stayed by your side 24 hours a day. When did you awaken?"

"Two years ago."

Crawchi was astounded.

As a puppeteer, he knew every detail about human expressions. The fact that he, who didn't miss even the slightest movement of facial muscles, had been unaware of Woorin's awakening for two years was shocking.

'Well... she is someone who has lived through eternal ages.'

Theraze is 'Mitochondrial Eve.'

Mitochondria are passed down only from mother to child. Therefore, tracing the lineage, one can meet the ancestor of all humanity, and that was Mitochondrial Eve.

Long, long ago, a woman's mitochondria underwent a strange mutation. It was the absolute genetic ability to transmit 100 percent of her memories to her children.

Theraze's daughters completely awaken their predecessors' memories after age ten. When a mother gives birth to a child, the child becomes the mother again.

This was merely using reproduction as a means - it was the same as one human living eternally.

She must have existed before taking the name Theraze. Perhaps it was when she was merely a primate. Therefore, she doesn't know the moment of her own genesis.

But all history from after her genesis remained in her head. From humanity's beginning until now.

Therefore, she was the only human with McClain Guffin's déjà vu remaining.

Theraze had known for a long time. That with only the ability to clone herself, she would eventually become extinct.

She could catch infectious diseases, get caught up in wars, or be swept away by natural disasters.

She focused on enhancing individual efficiency. And after 4,000 years of breeding experiments, she learned how to selectively put the father's genes into the fertilized egg.

From then on, Theraze became superior in all aspects.

She became more beautiful by inheriting the traits of physically superior males, and gained strong will by inheriting the blood of absolute rulers.

The business acumen of wealthy merchants, the physical abilities of great swordsmen, the intellectual abilities of great magicians - she absorbed all traits helpful for ruling the world into her body, passed them to the next generation, awakened memories again, and endlessly repeated the same process.

Through the process of repeating herself, Theraze became stronger.

Since these characteristics didn't manifest in sons, she directly established a nation in a woman's body. And now she reigns over the world as the emperor of Kashan and one of the Three Imperial Courts.

"It's been a while, Crawchi. Your handsome face has become quite damaged."

Crawchi realized it wasn't fourteen-year-old Woorin speaking, but Theraze who had visited him 200 years ago, and bowed respectfully.

"Thanks to Your Majesty's help, I gained immortality. For a puppeteer, a face is just wrapping paper. My pride lies in the mechanisms that make up my body."

"Huhu, that's just like you. Well... you were the same the day we first met."

Though Woorin would remember everything, Crawchi's memory was hazy.

Unable to readily answer, he asked a question to break the awkward silence.

"Pungjang came. If it's Your Majesty, you must have anticipated and called him. Did you know Shirone would survive?"

Woorin approached the window and drew back the curtains. The garden viewed from the apartment was still quietly asleep.

"Politics isn't about giving one thing and getting one thing, my dear. It's about making proposals where you can only win no matter what the opponent chooses. It would be good if Shirone lived, but even if he died, it wouldn't have been a bad result."

"I see."

"However, I can say this much. He had sufficient qualifications to survive."

"I understand you tested him several times."

Woorin looked up at the ceiling, recalling those times.

"First, I tested his luck. When he spun <Daily Daily Gift>, he won an excessive gift. I thought that might be possible."

Crawchi tilted his head as if he couldn't understand.

"Did you know that my creation would arrive as a gift?"

Woorin nodded.

"The world is like a marble-drawing machine. Inside the machine, blue events and red events are mixed together. People watching from outside can't know what pattern the marbles will come out in. That's exactly what humans are. They just go to the machine and spin it without knowing what will come out. Crawchi, do you think there's such a thing as luck?"

"Luck. Well, looking back, I think I was lucky."

Woorin smiled and continued her story.

"There's no such thing as luck. There's no such thing as misfortune either. Inside the box, it's already determined which marbles will come out in what order. Feeling it as luck or misfortune is simply because humans can't look inside the box. For someone, only blue marbles might keep coming out. Then for another person, only red marbles come out. Of course, there will be far more people who alternately take blue and red marbles. And all of that is human life, what we call existence."
