Crouch listened with serious eyes.

"But you know, how should I put this... Yes, when you live endlessly, you can glimpse a little inside the box. To explain it from a human perspective, you come to know who will be unfortunate and who will receive good fortune."

"I see."

Theraze had witnessed countless events from humanity's origins until now.

Sensing that an excessive gift would emerge before even spinning the roulette wasn't supernatural power or magic. It was an understanding of chaotic patterns gained from spinning the marble machine far too many times.

"I just had that kind of thought."

Perhaps thinking it sounded like bragging, Woorin cutely stuck out her tongue and simply ended it there.

Crouch found her adorable. It was absolute love offered to an existence beyond his reach.

"I'm always amazed by Your Majesty's foresight. However, what do you intend to do from now on?"

"Hmm, even a skilled person like Arius couldn't extract Ataraxia after entering. There must be something I don't know. I plan to hear from Zion. It's not like I have no idea."

"Then what about Sirone?"

While it was certain that Woorin had summoned Pungjang, he hadn't heard anything about Sirone's treatment yet. If she had taken custody for other reasons, he would need to act.

"My feeling is that Sirone is like red and blue marbles alternating. I'm not sure yet. I want to watch a little longer for now. Let him live his own life. However, block external interference. Regardless of factions, organizations, institutions, or nations."

"Understood."

Woorin gave an instruction befitting the Three Imperial Courts.

Maintaining Sirone's life as if today's events never happened was possible because Theraze's world was far broader than Sirone's world.

"And I will inherit Theraze's castle. Tell the sisters in each country to dissolve within two years."

"I will obey your command."

There was no need to seek permission from Kashan's ruler. Woorin's judgment was Theraze's judgment.

He had heard that in the early days of the lineage, conflicts arose over who would succeed the predecessor. But through the long years, Theraze had evolved itself to a stage where it could accept death.

The sisters would understand and end their lives when the opportunity arose.

But Woorin could be that target too. So why did Woorin judge that she should carry on Theraze's name?

If there was one difference between her and her sisters, it was just one thingâ€”she had met Sirone.

"Could Sirone... stop the final war?"

Woorin looked out the window, pleased with her subordinate's insight. Before long, morning had arrived and bright sunlight was illuminating the world.

"Hehe, stop the final war? I'm not carrying on Theraze's name for such a trivial reason."

"Then...?"

"Heaven is merely conquerable territory as well. It doesn't matter if it's not right now. I'm a being granted eternal time. Someday I will conquer beyond heaven to the ends of the universe."

Crouch gaped in bewilderment.

Conquering the universe. That was an ambition to pull down Anke Ra, the incarnation of the Akashic Records, and become a god herself.

"Ataraxia would be a shortcut to hasten that future. If Arius failed to that degree, it means no one can plunder it. But wouldn't the story be different if it were me?"

"If you would..."

"Yes."

Woorin turned to Crouch and placed both hands on her chest. Her figure smiling in the sunlight glittered golden.

"I will become Sirone's daughter."

The next morning, Kashan Empire's medical team transferred Sirone to his lodging.

They had taken every possible measure, but his consciousness hadn't returned yet. Even if consciousness returned, they said the probability of his mind recovering completely was fifty-fifty.

Vincent showed tears at the words that he might not be able to become a mage. Amy and Reina comforted Olina, who had collapsed and was sobbing.

"Don't worry. That's just general talk. Sirone's mental strength is different from other people. He'll definitely recover perfectly and open his eyes."

Olina, her voice choked, just nodded repeatedly.

Sensing something, Vincent wiped his face with his sleeve and comforted his wife.

"Yes, let's wait and see. The medical team also said fifty-fifty. It's not a desperate situation yet. At times like this, we need to be Sirone's strength."

Hearing this, Olina stood up abruptly. She couldn't just keep crying as a mother.

She placed a wet cloth on Sirone's burning forehead and clasped her hands together in prayer.

As a mage, Amy knew better than anyone how great a shock Sirone had received. She knew such temporary measures would be ineffective, but understanding the mother's heart, she just kept her mouth shut.

Leaving Sirone in Olina's care, the three quietly left the room.

At any rate, since they had saved his life, they now had to think about realistic problems. They wanted to pack up and return immediately, but Kasula was currently under Kashan's administrative control.

Internal interference was a matter of national disgrace. The nobles' resistance was considerable, but since Theraze was Orcamp's wife, even if in name only, it was awkward for them to openly rebel. In the end, they had no choice but to wait until tomorrow when the paternity test was completed.

It was only a day's difference, but spending a night in enemy territory felt like walking on thin ice.

Kashan's medical team had hinted that Kasula's nobles wouldn't be able to act further, but it wasn't reassuring. Above all, whether Eliza would remain patient was the biggest worry.

Olina had slapped the queen's cheek. A commoner committing violence against royalty was a capital crime punishable by death. Olina would have done the same even if time were reversed, but being released safely was an entirely different matter.

The night, longer than usual, passed and morning broke.

The Ozent family's attendants who had stayed up all night watching over Sirone all had dark circles under their eyes. Contrary to their concerns, nothing had happened. It seemed Kashan's medical team hadn't spoken carelessly.

Since it was the day Sirone's paternity test results would be announced, the Kasula nobles' attention was focused on the courthouse.

The safe displayed in the inner castle garden was retrieved. Since they had adopted an open surveillance system, no one had approached the safe during the display period.

The alchemists opened the perfectly fitted Caspi. If anyone had thoughts of mischief, now would be the only opportunity, but with control transferred to Kashan, no one dared to approach.

The alchemists confirmed the results, handed the examination to Kashan's minister, then wrote a report. Before the public announcement, they sent a letter to the king's apartment in advance.

Eliza had been bedridden with illness for two days.

Sirone's attempt to kill her had been shocking. Moreover, the cheek Olina had struck still hurt. Last night her fever had risen to 40 degrees and she hadn't slept a wink.

Orcamp's mind, caring for his wife, wasn't normal either.

His insides burned black with anger over the internal interference, and Sirone, who had been his only hope, was under Theraze's protection. Now only the test results remained to believe in. If only it could be confirmed that Sirone was his biological child, he could gain some voice in matters.

'I need Sirone. I need Sirone.'

Just then, the Interior Minister came with approval documents from the alchemy department.

"Your Majesty, the results are in."

Eliza rushed forward before Orcamp and snatched the documents. Her nervous hands trembled violently.

Sitting on the bed, she opened the document folder. It contained a single official document stamped with the alchemy department's seal.

The paper in Eliza's hands made rustling sounds as it trembled.

She read through every sentence written in the official document without missing a word. When the results finally entered her sight, thick tears flowed down her cheeks.

She embraced the crumpled official document and looked up at the ceiling.

"Ah, our son..."

* * *

Olina had nursed Sirone through the night. Perhaps her devotion worked, as the fever that had raged all night subsided a little by morning. Amy looked at Sirone with pity.

Kashan's medical team said there was a high possibility he would wake up within 24 hours. But if more than a day passed, they couldn't guess when he might regain consciousness after that.

Maybe they would only need to wait a day or two. But in the worst case, he might have to live as a vegetable for over a year.

'Well, he cast impossible magic.'

A first-tier depth monster had clawed, torn, and ripped apart Sirone's mind.

It was like tearing a child's blanket to cover an adult's body. Even considering Sirone's rapid growth rate, it was a realm that would require at least five years of training to reach.

She couldn't even imagine how great a shock had been dealt to his mind.

Could he recover?

If his mind's durability had lost its elasticity to bounce back, he would have no choice but to live as a cripple forever.

'Sigh, what am I thinking? There's no way Sirone would... Sirone would...'

There was a knock. When Reina opened the door, Eliza's maid bowed her head.

Amy thought what was bound to come had finally arrived.

"Her Majesty wishes to see Olina."

Olina nodded calmly.

After changing the wet cloth on Sirone's forehead to a new one, she kissed her son's cheek before preparing to leave.

"Let's go. Please guide me."

Vincent followed with a worried expression.

"Honey, let's go together."

"No. Her Majesty called for me. Don't worry. I'll be back soon."

Olina also had reasons to meet Eliza alone.

If the charge of assaulting royalty was established, she wouldn't be the only one to face execution. She needed to make a deal to protect her family.

The Grand Hall still bore traces of the fierce battle. The building debris had been cleared, but the collapsed floor was temporarily repaired with boards, and the broken pillars were left untouched as if no solution could be found.

The king and queen's attire was more splendid than ever. Olina could sense it was a desperate struggle to hide the humiliation of having their governing power seized by Kashan.

Eliza, who had been looking down at Olina arrogantly, was seized with bewilderment when she didn't avoid her gaze.

When they first met, this woman had been too frightened to even make eye contact. So why was she now glaring at the queen of a nation? Because she was a mother? That might be it.

But it wasn't acceptable in her heart.

'If our positions were reversed... could I do what she did?'

She had contradictory thoughts that it seemed like something any mother in the world could do, yet not something just anyone could do.

"I clearly remember what you did to me."

Olina let out a very small snort.

Orcamp thought dust might have entered his nose, but Eliza, being a woman, knew for certain it was a snort.

Her eyes seemed to say: If there's one thing I regret most in my life, it's that I only slapped you once.

"Do you think I'm a pathetic mother?"

"I'm not someone who dares to evaluate others. I simply couldn't tolerate my child being harmed."

Olina answered, bowing her head respectfully.

Orcamp couldn't detect the high-density psychological warfare between the women. So he kept his mouth shut.

Eliza recalled the situation when Sirone had gone berserk.

"Yes. It's true I was scared. But Sirone attacked me. If I had gone close, I might have died. You're acting as if you did something greater than I did, but what do you think would have happened if you were in my situation?"

"I still would have gone to Sirone."

"Why? Because you're his mother?"

"Because my child was stabbed with a blade."
