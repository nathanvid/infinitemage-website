Eliza's smile froze.

"Your Majesty, I don't know what happened that day. The only thing I could see was the sword piercing my bloodied son's abdomen. I couldn't think of anything, and in the end, I committed an unforgivable discourtesy toward Your Majesty."

Eliza gripped the armrest of her chair tightly.

"Hmph! How shameless! Well, commoners might say you're right! All they have are emotions! But I think differently! You nearly turned your son into an unfilial child!"

"If it's something Sirone chose, then I must accept it."

"Must accept it? What a conveniently self-serving way of thinking. No, it's cowardly. Sirone tried to kill me. And yet you're saying I don't even have the right to criticize Sirone?"

"Parents don't have that right."

Eliza ground her teeth and stood up. She looked ready to order an immediate execution.

Olina continued speaking with her gaze lowered, paying no mind.

"Parents only have the dozen or so years to teach their children not to commit such acts."

Eliza's mind went blank. She wanted to think of something, but her thoughts turned white as paper and she slumped back into her chair.

"Your Majesty, I was by Sirone's side for eighteen years. So now, whatever my son does, it's all my negligence. Please punish me."

Parents have no right to reject their child's decisions. But they are given countless hours to ensure such decisions aren't made in the first place.

Tears welled up in Eliza's eyes. She hadn't had that. The moment she abandoned her child, those precious hours disappeared as well.

Breaking the silence of the Grand Hall, a royal guard announced:

"Your Majesty, Sirone requests an audience."

Olina turned toward the door with a surprised expression.

Orcamp had also heard that no one knew when Sirone's consciousness would recover. After thinking for a moment, he gave a solemn command.

"Let him enter."

Sirone entered along the red carpet with a haggard face. Amy, Reina, and Vincent followed behind him. Vincent breathed a sigh of relief upon confirming Olina was safe.

"Well, what's the matter? You don't look well. If it's not urgent, you could rest first before we talk."

Sirone saved his response. Having rushed here immediately upon regaining consciousness, he didn't think he could raise his voice very loud.

Moving as close as possible to Orcamp, he spoke directly.

"I will leave... the royal castle immediately."

Amy, Reina, and his parents turned with surprised expressions.

Even when he had insisted on meeting Orcamp the moment he opened his eyes, they hadn't expected him to announce his departure so quickly.

"There's something I realized by coming here. From this moment forward, aside from the parents standing beside me, no other parents exist for me."

It was a promise Sirone was making with his entire life. It was also a declaration that he would sever all ties with Kasula.

Orcamp, who had been lost in thought, opened his mouth.

"I grant permission."

This time, everyone's gaze turned to Orcamp.

But he showed no particular emotion, as if he had already prepared himself. He simply looked calmly into Sirone's eyes.

"Sister Reina, please prepare a carriage. I'll return to my room to pack my belongings first."

While leaving the Grand Hall, Sirone never once looked back. You could tell how thoroughly sick of this place he was.

Reina glanced at Eliza. With Orcamp's permission granted, she thought she might slip away with Olina's matter as well.

She turned with her party after giving a farewell greeting with a coquettish smile, but Eliza's cold voice stabbed her in the back.

"Where are you going? I believe there are still matters we need to resolve among ourselves."

Olina turned around with a furrowed brow. Honestly, her heart was pounding, but she didn't want to show weakness at this point.

"The reason I called you here was because I couldn't decide what punishment to give you. I was going to execute you, but that wouldn't satisfy my anger. So at first, I thought about gouging out your eyes to make you blind or cutting out your tongue to make you mute."

Vincent's face flushed red. If they tried such a thing, he was prepared to escape with Olina even if it meant being buried here.

"But that wasn't satisfying either. So I thought about it this way and that, and suddenly it occurred to me. It was the perfect punishment. Namely..."

Everyone swallowed nervously, waiting for what would come next. Eliza looked at their reactions with drowsy eyes, then continued.

"Just letting you go."

"...What?"

Amy found herself asking without realizing it. The others were equally puzzled.

"If I harm you, Sirone will look only at you for the rest of his life. That bothered me. So I was going to let you go. To live your life weighing you against me, his biological mother who is a queen. To envy and be jealous of me until the moment you die."

Everyone was at a loss for words. Regardless of the severity of the punishment, it was a spiteful way of thinking.

Eliza, who had been radiating terrifying killing intent, suddenly showed a dejected expression and rummaged in her bosom.

"But just in case—though it would never really happen—I thought if you could persuade me, I should give you this. And... you won."

A crumpled paper left Eliza's hand and rolled across the floor.

Olina picked it up and slowly unfolded it. It was an official document with the results of the paternity test between Orcamp and Sirone. Since she was the one who had taught Sirone to read, she could understand most of it except for the difficult terminology.

She quickly skipped through the complex experimental details and turned her attention to the most important result. Unable to wait due to impatience, everyone's gaze turned to the document.

*After dissolving blood samples from Client 1 and 2 in oxytamine and storing them in a vacuum state for 3 days, no changes in color, concentration, or sediment were found. Therefore, based on the negative oxytamine reaction results, it is established that Client 1 (Orcamp) and Client 2 (Sirone) are not biologically father and son.*

"My goodness..."

Orcamp and Sirone were not father and son. Biologically, they were complete strangers.

Amy looked at Orcamp. She finally realized why he had seemed indifferent from earlier.

"How can this be?"

"I don't know either. Nor do I need to know. You can rest assured there's a 0% chance of manipulation. In any case, he's not my son, so take the document with you. Though I'm not sure if you'll need it."

Eliza added:

"Sirone doesn't know yet. Whether you tell him the truth or not is up to your judgment. Considering your rudeness two days ago, I'd like to remain Sirone's biological mother forever, but I'll forgive you this once, thinking that you did what I should have done."

Olina looked up with a surprised expression.

It might have been her imagination, but for a moment, Eliza seemed to have smiled.

"Now go. Sirone is your son."

* * *

The third basement level of Kasula's royal castle was an underground prison where countless political prisoners had been dragged during times of internal turmoil. They hadn't seen sunlight for decades and never would again.

Some nobles had married the humans who tortured them. Gender didn't matter. It was love that transcended the barriers of sex, a pure union between living beings. At least in their minds.

What could be wrong with that? For them, the end of the world was merely the walls of the underground prison. And this place was another society completely isolated from human society.

Woorin walked across the dirt floor filled with the stench of pus. Countless underground creatures scattered left and right with each step she took. They were the daily bread of the isolated ones.

"Uuuuuh. Uuuuuh."

Strange sounds leaked from every door installed in the walls. They seemed like pain yet also like pleasure. They sounded like crying, yet somehow gave the impression that someone was laughing.

The Kingdom of Kasula had been neglecting this place for five years now.

Though they had now fallen into utterly useless lives, someone might be enduring torture and waiting their time while containing dangerously explosive information. There was no need to drag them to the surface and create unnecessary trouble. It was better to just let them rot here forever.

Woorin recalled the contents of a novel her predecessor had read eighty years ago.

The protagonist was a child born in an underground prison that had been neglected for a full seventy years.

In that novel, the underground prison was described like an ant society. Women were valued for their role in bearing children, and when boys were born, they were used as food or became slaves who had to work for life.

The protagonist was born as Food 141. But with the help of the oldest man in the underground prison, he was able to become a slave.

The old man had been the highest noble seventy years ago and was the only person who knew the outside world. Knowing his life was nearly over, he passed all his knowledge to the protagonist.

When the protagonist turned fifteen, a civil war broke out in the kingdom. The underground prison was opened for the first time in eighty-five years, and the protagonist who escaped to the world pacified the civil war and became king.

Woorin's lips curved upward.

A novel is just a novel, but who knows? Perhaps such a miraculous thing might happen to Zion too, and the day would come when he could leave this place.

When she found Zion in the food storage, he was sustaining his life by relying on Armang's recovery program.

He would have died if left alone. And perhaps that would have been happier.

Zion wouldn't know—who saved him, who ordered his torture the moment he regained consciousness, who threw him into the underground prison as soon as he confessed what happened in Sirone's mind.

Zion was crouched in a prison crudely woven from wood.

He knew how miserable the underground prison was. His eyelids were swollen from crying all night, and he had a vacant expression like someone who had lost their mind.

Hearing footsteps, he instinctively curled up his limbs. Then, seeing Woorin's face reflected in the weak torchlight, he immediately showed a brightened expression and clung to the prison bars.

"Woorin! Here, I'm here! Get me out! Where have you been? Some crazy bastards tortured me and threw me in here!"

Even seeing Zion whining like a child begging for milk, Woorin felt not even a trace of maternal love.

Her son hadn't manifested Theraze's abilities. To her, who existed through self-replication, her son was nothing more than a shell that merely resembled her in appearance.

Zion's face after being tortured was a mess. Scabs had formed on the beaten areas and his eyes were bruised black and blue. His ribs were broken and wrapped tightly in bandages.

Even though he could barely move, seeing him struggle showed that the underground prison was indeed frightening.

"What a sorry state. How did my successful big brother end up like that?"

Zion's eyes lit up when he saw the sword Woorin was wearing.

Though it was sheathed, the hilt was definitely the *Magic Sword Armang*. She must have brought it to help him escape.

"Damn it! That bastard, I won't let him off easy. Is Sirone still at the royal castle? No, it doesn't matter. I'll find him and kill him."

Zion reached out through the prison bars to grab Armang.

Woorin stepped back. When Zion looked at her puzzledly, she smiled and showed him the prison key.

"What? Did the release order already come down? You should have told me sooner."

When the lock was undone, Zion immediately kicked off from the bars and emerged from the prison. At the same time, Woorin grabbed his neck and pushed him back into the prison.

"Kuk...!"

Zion, who hit the back of his head against the wall, slumped down in that position. Woorin leaned in close while still choking his neck.

"Don't you understand the situation yet, you pathetic human?"

"Woo... Woorin...! Why are you...!"

"Do you know why I didn't kill you?"

Zion was one of the few humans who had reached the first level of Sirone's depths. They had already heard much through his mouth, but he might be useful someday.

"What you saw, what you heard, what you experienced—you must not reveal any of it. If you recall anything, I'll destroy your brain. If you try to do anything, I'll destroy your limbs."

From Woorin's cold tone, Zion realized something. It was like hearing his mother's icy voice.
