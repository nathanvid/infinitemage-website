The instinctive thought that came to mind was that he needed to get out of this place.

To activate Diamond Armed, he needed to grip his sword. But Armang's handle was too far away.

'Remote control...!'

Receiving Zion's mental waves, Armang emerged from its sheath with a watery sound. But before it could reach Zion's hand, Woorin grabbed the handle with her left hand with a quick motion.

Zion glared venomously at Woorin.

This wasn't the younger sister he knew. Not only had she grabbed Armang's handle without even checking the position, but the strength with which she was holding the remotely controlled Armang in place was incomprehensible.

Woorin slowly moved her arm that was gripping Armang in reverse. Though Zion issued another command, Armang couldn't break free and only vibrated with a trembling sound.

As the blade approached Zion's neck, the vibration sound became crystal clear. His sister's wrist extending from her sleeve was as slender as an ordinary girl's. He had never even heard that she had learned swordsmanship.

'But how does she have such strength?'

Woorin's face was calm, without even the slightest sign of exertion.

However, a powerful force of will was at work in her mind. A technique called incarnation in Heaven. Moreover, the swordsmen of this world called such phenomena divine transcendence.

Woorin slowly moved the sword toward Zion's neck. Even with divine transcendence, its effectiveness would diminish if the body couldn't support it, but Zion's weak mental strength posed no problem.

"You are not qualified to be the master of this sword."

As Armang moved contrary to his will, Zion's mind became hazy.

Finally, the blade touched his neck. The vibration intensified, causing his skin to split open.

"Cancel the contract. Otherwise, your neck will be severed."

Where the blade touched felt cold as if ice water was flowing. Then, as it suddenly became hot as if on fire, he cried out without realizing it.

"C-contract canceled!"

With Zion's cry, Armang's vibration stopped.

Only then did Woorin release Zion's neck and sheathe Armang.

"It's too precious a sword to give to you. I'll put it to good use."

Zion, pressed against the wall, rubbed his neck marked with palm prints and said:

"You... just who are you?"

"You would do well to heed my words, mortal being."

Leaving those words behind, Woorin left the prison.

The door was open, but Zion couldn't move. Only after she disappeared did he realize what reality was.

He must do nothing. Until she released him, he would have no choice but to rot in the underground dungeon forever.

As overwhelming despair struck, tears flowed down. Then he slowly collapsed to his side and began trembling with his head buried in the corner.

* * *

Woorin emerged from the underground prison with Armang sheathed.

The combat-ready silver scabbard had been prepared in advance by commissioning a craftsman. While gold would be most stylish, it was excluded from consideration for being impractical.

"I hope he likes it."

As she left through the castle gate, all traces of Theraze disappeared completely from Woorin's face.

Having returned to being a fresh-faced 14-year-old girl, she smiled brightly and ran toward the carriage.

"Shirone!"

Shirone, who was loading luggage onto the carriage, turned his head. Woorin was approaching, waving her hand. Suddenly, a nerve in his mind passed through a certain point. But strangely, it was just an empty space. After blinking for a moment, he smiled with relief. Though he was cutting ties with Orcamp cleanly, he had wanted to see her at least once more.

He had heard that Theraze's direct guard Pungjang had appeared and taken him away after he lost consciousness. Without question, it was Woorin who had pulled strings for him. Moreover, if not for the "Last Cry of the Jaeger Family" she had given him, he would already be a corpse, unable to dodge Zenogger's strike.

"Are you leaving now?"

"Yeah. I've been grateful all this time. Actually, I was worried about leaving without saying goodbye."

"Hehe, what's with goodbyes between us? Still, we'll be able to see each other again someday, right?"

Shirone scratched his eyebrow with a troubled expression.

Though he had been in critical condition until just a while ago, fortunately there was no major problem with his mind. If he continued his life as a mage, Woorin would be an unavoidable presence.

But having obtained the freedom he had desperately desired, he hoped there would be no more entanglements.

"Are you still upset with me?"

"It's not that. But we're too different."

Woorin smiled bitterly.

Anyone would think the same after experiencing such events at the royal castle. But hearing it from the person she had marked as her future husband, she couldn't help but feel hurt.

"Still... you think of me as a friend, right?"

"Of course. No, you're my benefactor. You saved my life."

"Then that's enough. Don't worry. I'll never trouble you again."

Shirone realized the meaninglessness of words. That too was something Woorin had taught him. But he couldn't help but be grateful for such considerate words.

"Yeah, take care of yourself too."

"Ah! And this..."

Woorin held out the sword she had been wearing at her waist.

He could tell at a glance that it was Armang. However, not understanding the reason, he stared blankly until Woorin spoke.

"I'll give this to you as a gift. Zion won't be able to come out of prison for a long time."

He had heard through Reina that Zion was alive. Though he didn't know the full story, Empress Theraze had personally imprisoned him for the crime of defiling the authority of the royal bloodline.

Just as when he had seen it in Zion's gallery, Armang emitted a tempting light. But Shirone couldn't readily accept it. He didn't want to be indebted to royalty ever again.

Amy understood his feelings. Just hearing the words Theraze, or rather Kasula, gave him a headache. But this wasn't just any object—it was an S-class Objet. Unless he was a fool, it made no sense to refuse this.

"Shirone, refusing a gift is also against etiquette."

When Shirone looked back with half-closed eyes, Amy stuck out her tongue and stepped back.

Woorin pushed the sword toward Shirone's chest as if telling him not to worry.

"You can accept it. I'm giving compensation on behalf of the Kingdom of Kasula. You suffered terribly because of the royal castle's circumstances. I absolutely won't think of it as a debt."

Woorin was sincere this time too. This wasn't a debt. Think of it as a kind of dowry.

If she put it that way, he couldn't help but be tempted. But what still troubled him was that it was too excessive a gift.

S-class Objets were items that even royalty found difficult to obtain. Moreover, if it was Armang, it wasn't just for amusement but specialized for combat. Even if put up for auction, he couldn't even guess what the market price would be.

"I'm not sure if I should really accept this. Above all, I'm not a swordsman. Wouldn't it be better for this item to go to someone who needs it more than I do?"

"Hehe, you don't know Armang's true value yet. Try making a contract first. If you don't like it, you can cancel it anytime."

Only then did Shirone accept Armang. But having never encountered a contract-type Objet before, he didn't know how to make a contract.

"This... how do I do it?"

"Hold the magic sword with both hands, set it upright, then say this: 'I, the great mage Shirone, command you—Armang shall obey my orders.'"

Shirone looked at Woorin with an incredulous expression. Then she sheepishly raised the corner of her mouth and said:

"Just say 'Contract.'"

Shirone drew Armang and shouted "Contract." As the jewel emitted light, a magnificent tremor was transmitted to his palm.

"But is the contract complete? I don't feel anything?"

He knew that Magic Sword Armang shared consciousness with its user. But Shirone couldn't feel any different from a moment ago.

"That's because you haven't activated Armang yet. Remote control is only possible when Diamond Armed copies the user's brain. Try saying Diamond Armed."

Amy, who had witnessed the state of Diamond Armed before, gulped.

The spectacle of the blade decomposing and swallowing the user was impressive, but the ability enhancement that instantly transformed Zion, who had never even handled a sword, into a warrior was also noteworthy.

"Diamond Armed."

Armang's blade opened into an eerie framework and swallowed Shirone starting from his face. In Zion's case, the transformation was instantaneous, but for first-time users, it took considerable time.

The metal framework attached spirally along his muscle lines. With only the framework complete, thin needles entered Shirone's central nervous system.

"Huh!"

—New user cerebral scan. Analysis. Mental activity specialization. Linguistic cognitive ability activation.

A magnificent voice that seemed to be transmitted through a golden crown echoed in his head. Then organic matter richly seeped from the framework tightly gripping Shirone's body.

Amy, who was watching, realized that Armang was transforming not into armor but into robes.

Light bone-material terraced gauntlets were equipped on both wrists, and the organic matter that had become a hood covered his face. Finally, a cloak spread out like a stream of water and fluttered.

—Neural network activation. Focus point detection. Beta wave relaxation. Theta wave maximization. Time division section search in progress. Available for use. Materialization possibility suggested. Approved. Exobrain generation. Conceptual word search. Oe.

Pressure was transmitted to the leather of the right gauntlet. Looking into his palm, he saw a convex hemispherical glass embedded there. Light shot from there, gathering glassy material in the air.

A completed purple crystal sphere quickly circled once around Shirone. It was a crystal sphere called Oe, another brain that specialized Shirone's time division ability.

"Wow..."

Everyone watching Shirone widened their eyes.

Shirone in his hood was a perfect professional mage. The organic matter forming the robe had desert colors, far from flashy, but this side looked stronger.

Not knowing how his appearance had changed, Shirone was simply amazed by the changes occurring within his body. His physical abilities had improved, but his head was refreshingly clear. It was at least twice as clear as when he had been in his best condition.

Above all, he was delighted with the magic weapon Oe. Since it was a copy of the same brain, there was still only one slot, but the speed of time division could increase dramatically. Moreover, when operating passive magic, it was no different from having a double Spirit Zone.

"Really amazing..."

Woorin smiled with satisfaction and nodded.

"Armang complements weaknesses and maximizes strengths based on the user's information. Now cancel Diamond Armed and try remote control."

When Shirone thought of canceling, Diamond Armed disbanded.

Armang, which had returned to a smooth sword, flew through the air according to Shirone's thoughts. Having already achieved mental integration through Diamond Armed, sharing consciousness didn't feel alien.

Armang flew at low altitude before entering the scabbard that had fallen to the ground. Then it flew to Shirone's side and fixed itself as if wearing a belt. This too was Armang's consideration to not burden the mage's body with any weight.

"Thank you. But no matter how I think about it, this is too much. It's an S-class Objet."

"Ugh, you're really impossible. Well, that's why I like you though."

Woorin tested the waters slightly, but Shirone seemed not to feel any special meaning.

Is it still too much to expect? But someday... With such thoughts, she grabbed Shirone's arm to ease his burden.

"It's fine. I think Objets need to meet good masters as much as their abilities are efficient. Please take good care of it from now on. Well then, see you next time."

Woorin said this and turned away first. She knew that given Shirone's personality, if she didn't turn away decisively, he wouldn't leave even after a day.

Shirone conveyed his gratitude to Woorin, who had been considerate until the end, and got into the carriage.

As the horses neighed and departed, Shirone's group cheered.

Going home felt like a dream.

For a while, it was noisy. They enthusiastically badmouthed the Kasula nobles and speculated about various things regarding Magic Sword Armang.

After an hour passed, the interior of the carriage, furnished like a home, was enveloped in peaceful silence.
