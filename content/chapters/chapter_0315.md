Sirone, still reeling from the mental shock, lay in bed and fell asleep. On the opposite bed sat Vincent and Olina, while Amy sat on the floor enjoying the view outside the window.

Reina, who had been lost in thought, spoke with a relieved expression.

"Phew, that was really a long four days."

Amy, who had been pleasantly enjoying the breeze, turned around.

"I know, right. But I was really shocked. To think Orcamp wasn't his biological parent."

Vincent shook his head as he recalled those moments.

"I was just as surprised. When my wife entered the Grand Hall, I thought we'd inevitably have to bury our bones here."

Reina looked at Olina.

"But what will you do? Are you going to tell Sirone the truth?"

"I've been thinking about it, and I think it's better not to tell him. He'll find out eventually anyway."

Amy asked.

"Why? Queen Eliza went so far as to deliver an official document stating he wasn't her biological child. We should definitely let Sirone know that such a woman is absolutely not his real mother."

"I saw the look in Sirone's eyes when he entered the Grand Hall. Maybe Sirone already knew. That they weren't his biological parents."

Reina agreed with her words.

"That's true, he's smart and perceptive. Sirone said it himself - that he has no parents except you two. Maybe that was something he said under the assumption that other biological parents might come looking for him?"

When they thought about it that way, everything fell into place. At first they thought it was something he said out of a sense of betrayal, but Sirone wasn't the type to act so childishly.

"He's a good child. He spoke boldly in front of Her Majesty, but honestly he's too good a son for us. I don't have the face to look at my son after getting him involved in something like this."

Reina offered comforting words.

"Don't think that way. It couldn't be helped. The region and time where they abandoned their son matched, and there was only one case of an abandoned child at that time."

"Wait a minute!"

Amy raised her hand as if she had realized something.

The maid who abandoned her son had definitely said she left the child in the stable in the Valley of True Names. That's why Sirone had been invited to the royal castle as a likely candidate. But contrary to expectations, the result showed they weren't father and son.

"Then who on earth... is Sirone?"

Everyone fell silent as they grasped the meaning in the question.

If he wasn't Orcamp's child either, then whose abandoned child was Sirone?

Vincent recalled that day, which was still vivid in his memory. He had heard a child's crying while sleeping and headed to the stable. But he couldn't find any traces of someone having entered the stable.

What had happened that night? Why couldn't Orcamp's child be found? What had Sirone realized that made him say such things to Orcamp?

Sirone was only sleeping deeply, carrying countless answers buried in his depths.

Armin had arrived at Toshuka village. He had been able to hear news on his way back that Sirone was safe.

But now his own problem remained. If rumors spread that he was connected to a Black Line mage, his superiors wouldn't stand for it.

'It should be fine. I explained it clearly.'

Since he had explained to Amy the reason for wearing the mask, she would keep her promise.

Even if she didn't keep it, there was nothing he could do about it. That was the foundation of trust.

Having put his mind at ease, Armin looked up at the house surrounded by a time barrier. It was deathly quiet.

Sighing, he cast Flicker magic and was greeted by the scene inside the room.

The moment he arrived at the spot where he had cast the Stop spell, time resumed its flow and the vase crashed to pieces.

Kaira glared at Armin. Since her attention had been drawn to the falling vase, it was impossible to confirm how much Armin's position had changed.

"How many days... have passed?"

"Well. About 4 days..."

Kaira bit her lips and swallowed her indignation.

"You went after all? Even though I told you not to?"

"What are you talking about?"

"Don't think of deceiving me! If that weren't the case, there would be no reason to set up a time barrier!"

Armin calmly lied.

"I was just momentarily angry and needed time to think."

Kaira snorted. Who would believe such words?

But what made her furious was that there was no way to verify it. The fact that he was lying so boldly meant he ultimately hadn't left any traces. Therefore, he still held control of the situation.

"Fine, I understand. I'll speak well of you to the higher-ups. For now, give me your report."

"I'll say it again - I didn't go anywhere."

Kaira ground her teeth.

Armin had been famous for his stubbornness since joining the organization, so once he shut his mouth, there was no way to make him talk by any means.

Just then, a small bird made of red light passed through the wall and entered. It was a Telebird sent from headquarters.

Not only the level of photon sculpting, but flying 78,000 kilometers to deliver information was something only a mage who had reached the extreme limits of information magic could accomplish.

A Telebird emitting red light meant a first-class crisis situation.

The bird glowed red as it carved letters in the air. Kaira's face turned pale as she interpreted the code in real time.

"That's impossible. It can't be this fast..."

Watching the red bird disappear like flames, Armin walked to the window. If it had been before going to Kasula, he would have thought the same as Kaira, but not anymore.

"I've changed my mind. Let's go back, Kaira. There's something I need to report to headquarters."

He wasn't someone who would break his stubbornness over a simple whim. Kaira guessed that the incident in Kasula and the incident reported by the Telebird weren't entirely unrelated.

"You know something, don't you?"

Armin remained silent until the end.

He hoped Sirone could enjoy his school days even a little. On the day when everyone would know, the world would never leave him alone.

'We might meet sooner than expected, Sirone.'

**One Third (1)**

The Kingdom of Kasula had cut off all diplomatic channels.

No official position statement was made. They only conveyed through hotlines that governing authority had been transferred to the Kashan Empire.

The allied nations were greatly displeased, but since Theraze was backing them, they couldn't openly exercise pressure.

It was the power of the Three Imperial Courts, and thus the Kingdom of Kasula gradually moved away from the world's attention.

Sirone rested for several days before returning to school. The advanced class curriculum had ended, but with the graduation exam - the magic school's greatest event - approaching tomorrow, the atmosphere at school was heated.

Returning to the magic school meant he wasn't royalty, so his classmates' attitude toward Sirone remained cold. However, since it wasn't certain, they couldn't pour out abuse like before.

While Sirone had felt somewhat hurt before leaving school, compared to the humiliation he suffered in Kasula, it was just child's play. Moreover, he had many worries lately and had no time to care about other people's thoughts.

A monster slept within his heart.

The evidence was that he could feel a sense of emptiness in his brain, as if some enormous memory had existed there.

At first it was just a simple feeling. Then, as he found stability, the outline emerged like fossils being excavated.

While some memories were completely lost, scenes that had made strong impressions gradually became clearer.

When the demon god forcibly expanded his mind, it had been unbearably painful.

No, had it really been that way?

In truth, at the end of the pain, he had tasted an explosive sense of liberation. The feeling of acceleration through rampage was euphoric like being intoxicated by drugs, and thrilling pleasure flowed each time magic was activated.

'No. That wasn't me.'

It wasn't me. It was a new being formed by the combination of the avatar called Sirone and the demon god. But following the chain of thought ultimately led to the conclusion that it was also himself.

The demon god still slept deep within Sirone's inner depths. And the key to release the seal was still held in his hands.

'I must not open it. If I can't control myself, nothing can be mine.'

Because he was weak, the demon god had seized control. To reverse the master-servant relationship, he needed powerful strength that wouldn't waver in any situation.

Sirone headed to the training ground. Since regular courses had ended, no students were visible.

After practicing arithmetic sequences for about an hour, he calmly opened his eyes and concentrated photons. Taking the magical action of grasping a sphere with both hands, photons were born between his palms.

The demon god had expanded his mind to just before the elasticity of Diamond Body collapsed. It couldn't have been something attempted through calculation. If not for Diamond Body, he would already be a cripple holed up in his room.

Sirone was surprised by the photons' compression power, which was different from before.

Even when preparing for the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society's presentation, he had strengthened his Spirit Zone by rebounding his mind daily. But this time it was an extreme rebound incomparable to that.

As he concentrated divine particles, the light source of Photon Cannon gradually became smaller, transforming into a white sphere with clear edges. It was like looking at platinum burning in sunlight.

Compressing it further would cause density to rise exponentially, creating the magic called Dark Sphere, but would inevitably result in losing control.

Sirone flattened the photons up and down. When he threw the disc-like flattened photon, the flash quickly curved, cutting through space and returning.

He caught it, split it in two, then sculpted it into the form of throwing stars. The moment he extended both hands, the throwing stars pierced through space in a straight line before eating reverse rotation and returning.

Even after applying sculpting twice, the form didn't collapse, so Sirone split it into even smaller pieces.

He sculpted 8 flying daggers with streamlined bodies resembling birds and crescent-shaped wings, placing them between his fingers.

As he swung both arms in an X-cross pattern, responding sensitively to air pressure, the 8 flying daggers made sounds like a swarm of locusts as they clawed in all directions. If any flying creature had jumped into the radius, it would have instantly become mincemeat.

Sirone swept up the flying daggers that were losing lift and slowing down, 4 in each hand. Their density had weakened considerably. The moment he combined the flying daggers like clay, the photons exploded, spreading blade-like flashes. Light fragments that sparkled like petals floated before his eyes.

"Hmm..."

Thanks to controlling the luminescence of photons, detailed sculpting became possible even without using Fractal Omniscience. Since function comes from form, the versatility of photon-based magic was incomparable to before.

But Sirone's face wasn't satisfied.

Just as he was resting his chin and lost in thought, he felt a presence behind him. Turning his head, he saw Iruki and Nade with their mouths hanging open wide enough to dislocate their jaws.

"Oh? When did you guys get here?"

Nade was speechless and couldn't respond.

Hearing that he had gone to the training ground immediately upon returning, they thought it was just like Sirone, but it was actually the opposite. He was wielding magic at a completely different level from the Sirone of a few days ago.

"What was that just now? A newly developed magic? What's it called?"

"There's no name for it. I was just trying this and that. I've become able to control the luminescence of photons. But using it like a weapon seems inefficient. I want to think about it a bit more."

Due to photons' nature, they were most vulnerable to sculpting, so magic incorporating sculpting techniques consumed mental power greatly. Unless it had significantly superior effectiveness to Photon Cannon, there was no reason to change it into attack magic.

Iruki came to a conclusion.

"So you're saying the magic that left us dumbfounded was nothing more than a simple experiment. The kind of trash among trash magic you'll never look at again."

"...No, it's not quite that bad."

Iruki chuckled and asked.

"Just what happened? I heard that governing authority was transferred to Kashan."
