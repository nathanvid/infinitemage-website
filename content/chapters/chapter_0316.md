Shirone told them about what he had experienced in Kasula.

As Amy had requested, he left out the story about Armin, but even so, there had been far too many incidents. He had engaged in heated debates with a king of a nation and became friends with Woorin, the daughter of the Empress. He had clashed with executives of the Magic Department and even demonstrated Ataraxia in front of the highest nobles.

His friends listened with their mouths hanging open in bewilderment. The scale was too absurd for an eighteen-year-old boy to experience. Shirone had been to the royal castle.

"So you got stabbed with a sword? You really almost died."

Shirone lifted his shirt to show the wound. The stitched marks were clearly visible.

Iruki asked worriedly.

"Is your head okay? The shock must have been considerable."

"Fortunately, after resting for a few days, I got much better. My stomach still throbs though. Oh right, I brought the Objet too. Come to my room later. I'll show you."

"Gasp! Really? Weapons are prohibited on campus. You got stabbed and became really brave, huh?"

Shirone waved his hand with a tired expression.

"No, I didn't want to either, but there were some circumstances."

Armand, whose pride was hurt by being stuffed in a corner of the room, tormented Shirone with mental waves every night. Since he was picking at his mind when he should have been resting, Shirone had no choice but to promise to bring him along. Like most magic swords, Armand's personality seemed quite difficult as well.

"Then let's go see it now. I want to see it quickly! Armament! Remote Control!"

"Later. I have somewhere to go right now."

"Huh? Where are you going?"

Iruki nudged Nade's side.

"It's the graduation exam. He needs to spend the last night with his girlfriend."

Shirone shook his head firmly.

"That's not it! Amy followed me all the way to Kasula and helped me. I want to go cheer her on in person."

"Of course you would. Anyway, hurry up and go. The steel door closes when the sun sets. Tell her to do her best too."

Shirone checked the time and was startled.

"Huh? Has it already gotten this late? Then I'll go and come back. See you later."

Leaving the training ground, Shirone headed toward the graduation class building.

The reason he couldn't go find Amy immediately upon arriving at school was because the experiences as the Avatar were floating beyond the veil of consciousness. Among them, the scene where he had confessed his jealousy to Amy would infiltrate like a surprise attack, making him want to hide in a mouse hole.

If he had tried to talk right after the incident ended, there wouldn't have been this awkwardness, but the situation hadn't allowed it. Shirone, who had collapsed unconsciously in the carriage, was escorted home, while Amy returned to school without a moment's rest to prepare for her graduation exam.

'Ah, this is trouble. How can I face Amy?'

Shirone shook his head and brushed away his thoughts.

Amy had followed him all the way to Kasula before an important exam. If it hadn't been for her, he wouldn't have been able to attend magic school today with such a sound mind.

'Right, let's not think about anything for now. Amy's passing comes first.'

The day when she, who had entered at age twelve, would bear the fruit of six years of effort was just one day away. Her current graduation class rank was an impressive 4th place. It was tremendous growth to achieve in just half a year.

'So I won't be able to keep my promise after all? Well, it doesn't matter.'

Shirone had promised to catch up to Amy. But she too had reached her high rank through relentless effort. If she graduated, he would gladly admit defeat.

Passing through the steel door that symbolized the graduation class, he could see several upperclassmen walking in the flower garden.

No one looked at Shirone. Not today. Their minds were filled entirely with thoughts of tomorrow.

While some upperclassmen focused on mental concentration, others thought it was better to relax. The group huddled around the campfire chatting were those students.

There were many familiar upperclassmen, and Amy and Seriel were also mixed in with that group.

"Oh my, isn't that Shirone over there?"

"Huh? It really is!"

Shirone approached with a stiff expression. He hadn't expected Amy to be with other upperclassmen.

"Hello..."

Seriel ran over and hugged Shirone's face.

"Waaah! It's Shirone! What brings you here? Did you come to cheer me on?"

Buried in Seriel's chest, Shirone's cheeks burned hot.

But feeling her body trembling, he realized this was no joke. He could hear her rapidly beating heartbeat.

'So this is what it's like to be in the graduation class.'

Everyone here had dedicated their lives to becoming mages. And if they passed tomorrow's exam, they would become the mages of their dreams.

The probability was one third.

When it was someone else's business, he had thought it was a pretty high probability. But when he actually applied it to the people involved, it meant that the remaining 20 people would have to compete horribly for another year.

Thinking that way, even Seriel's chest didn't feel embarrassing.

Shirone hugged her with all his strength. Everyone had worked hard. He couldn't imagine anyone here failing.

But if possible... he hoped she would pass.

"Do your best, senior. I'll be cheering for you too."

"Yeah. Thanks, Shirone."

Only then could Shirone see Seriel's face. Fear and excitement coexisted there.

Even her expression that looked like she might burst into tears at any moment seemed noble. Because he knew what kind of effort she had made to get to this point.

Shirone looked back at Amy.

Unlike Seriel, her face showed neither tension nor excitement. All preparations were complete. Her six years of growth curve seemed perfectly aligned toward tomorrow.

That made him feel good and grateful. If she had shown even the slightest wavering, he would have been tormented by guilt for taking her to Kasula.

"Amy, you do your best too. I'll cheer hard for you tomorrow."

"Yeah, thanks. I'll do my best."

Currently, Amy's mind was like a great river where all streams of thought had merged and flowed as one. There was no room for awkward situations like those in Kasula to surface.

Shirone chatted pleasantly with the upperclassmen. Student council president Amira was also there. She was the one who had incited the student council to stage a sit-in when Shirone was trapped in Miro's space-time, but now that was just part of their memories.

"Finally, after tomorrow, this damn school life will be over."

Most nodded at Amira's words. No one facing the exam thought they would fail.

However, Samuel's expression wasn't good.

Shirone remembered when he had come as Ethella's demonstration assistant. The upperclassman who had amazed the advanced class students with his incredible sound magic.

But even he had failed the graduation exam last year, and this was his second attempt.

According to magic school statistics, the probability of a student who failed the first exam passing the second exam was quite low, so it was natural for him to be nervous.

Amira comforted Samuel.

"Don't worry too much, Samuel. You worked hard. You barely failed the last graduation exam too. There'll be good results this time."

"Yeah, thanks. You make sure to pass too."

Since not everyone could pass alone, the fact that competitors could encourage each other was at least the human side of things.

"Hey? You're all gathered here?"

Famous upperclassmen from the school walked over.

Richard of alchemy. Electric Monster Lycan. Hersie of Sonic.

And leading them was Ardino Fermi, ranked 1st in Class One.

Fermi, who insisted on formal wear, looked more suited to be an accountant than a mage. Come to think of it, he had heard that the Ardino family was also a famous merchant family.

"What's with those stiff faces? Don't be too nervous. Even I, who's been taking graduation exams for six years, am here. Hahaha!"

Fermi joked around, but no one laughed.

The reason why he, who always monopolized first place in the graduation class, hadn't graduated yet was one of Alpheus Magic School's mysteries. Some rumors circulated that he was a broker who took money to give advantageous treatment in graduation exams, but nothing was confirmed.

"Fermi, aren't you being too complacent? If you keep acting so carefree, you'll end up taking the exam with underclassmen again next year."

"Haha! I'm just doing my best. This kind of thing is originally left up to heaven."

Feeling eyes on him, Fermi turned his head. Amy was looking at him with a bold expression.

"Whew, our little miss is full of spirit today too? How's your condition?"

"Perfect. How about yours?"

"Me too... so-so."

"I hope you take the exam in perfect condition. Tomorrow is the day I graduate from magic school in first place."

"Hahaha! I really can't match you. Alright, let's have a proper showdown. Tomorrow we're competitors, not just fellow students."

As Fermi led his group away, those gathered around the campfire watched them with wary eyes. Not only their skills, but since they were all veterans who had taken the graduation exam at least four times, the difference in experience couldn't be ignored either.

To change the atmosphere, Amira brought up a topic.

"I went to the World Climate Organization during last vacation. It was really amazing. There were over a thousand professional mages there."

"Wow, that place has incredible influence. They say the director has more power than a king of a nation?"

Weather is a powerful factor that controls human clothing, food, shelter, food production, and ecosystems. Therefore, climate mages belonging to the Red Line are considered criminal if they use magic without passing national examinations. Also, since there are no borders, international agreements are necessary, and the World Climate Organization oversees them.

"It's not just the World Climate Organization that has tremendous power. One of my relatives works at the astronomical observatory, and even high nobles can't do anything about it."

"But you have to pass the national exam. Someone I know couldn't pass for 10 years and eventually changed majors."

Amira spoke with fighting spirit.

"Hehe! That's why I'm challenging it. High risk, high return is my motto. If I just pass, I can challenge the highest place a mage can reach."

"Well, you could probably do it. When you secure a position later, make sure to contact me, okay? Haha!"

Since Amira had been student council president, it was natural to envision her as director of the World Climate Organization.

Later, when she realized in society how vast the gap between the two positions was, today's remarks would be so embarrassing she couldn't bear it, but what would be the big deal? Dreams are dreams because someone achieves them.

Starting with Amira, each person shared their aspirations.

Seriel's initial dream was to get a job at a health center and live normally, but now her thinking had changed and she wanted to develop vaccine magic at the World Health Organization. Her theory was that if vaccine magic became active, the unit price of pharmaceuticals would decrease.

Amy still aimed to be a soldier, but after visiting Kasula this time, she had gained a new sense of calling.

Listening to her words, Shirone thought of Zion. When he heard that Zion had threatened Amy saying he would go to war with Tormia, his blood had boiled to the point where he wanted to enlist in the army too.

Samuel was thinking of double-majoring. He said incantations were important, but he planned to study abroad to learn mental magic.

"Hah! Everyone's living intense lives. Alright, let's work hard! Tomorrow we'll all become mages!"

"Great!"

Watching the upperclassmen take their first steps toward their dreams, Shirone felt his chest swell with emotion.

He sincerely hoped everyone here would pass.

Morning came.

The Colosseum where the graduation exam would be held was bustling with people.

Though not mandatory, all students had applied to watch, and most parents of the graduation class had also come to school. Scouts from magic associations of various countries and correspondents who came for coverage had arrived as well.

Shirone couldn't believe that people he had seen in newspapers were casually walking around. It felt like watching politics rather than a magic school exam.

"The graduation exam really is amazing."

Iruki said nonchalantly.

"It's like this every year. They're really extreme. I just hope my dad didn't come."

"Shirone, that person over there. Isn't that Amy's father?"

Karmis Shakora and his wife Isis were standing arm in arm in front of the Colosseum.
