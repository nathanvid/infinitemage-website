Though retired from active duty, the influence of a first-rank noble was immense. Perhaps because of this, countless parents approached him seeking to pay their respects.

Shirone led his friends over to Shakora. Taking advantage of a moment when other nobles weren't around, he offered his greetings.

"Hello."

"Ah, it's Shirone. How have you been?"

"Yes, thanks to you."

Isis approached with a worried expression.

"Shirone, what about our Amy? Hm? Do you think she'll be able to pass?"

"How would Shirone know that? Don't needlessly worry the poor boy and just stay calm."

At Shakora's scolding, Isis's lower lip jutted out petulantly.

"Haha! It's fine. I met her yesterday and she seemed to be in good condition."

"Hmm, that's a relief."

A look of relief crossed Shakora's face. A father's love for his daughter—though he pretended otherwise, he seemed quite nervous. Even a first-rank noble was just a parent when it came to his child.

Iruki and Nade, who had been standing behind Shirone, also offered their greetings. Particularly when he heard the surname Mercurian, Shakora showed interest.

"Ah, so you're Iruki. How is your father doing?"

"Yes. Well... he still exists, as usual."

It was rather impertinent words to utter in such a setting, but Shakora merely laughed it off.

Honestly, Iruki was quite well-mannered. Compared to his father, who was the epitome of eccentricity.

"Shirone, bring your friends and visit our home sometime."

"Yes. I definitely will."

After finishing their greetings, Shakora and Isis headed toward the entrance where parents were entering. Shirone also entered the colosseum through the student-only gate.

Underclassmen and peers sent envious glances his way, but he wasn't particularly lonely. One by one, children who weren't interested in things like social status and were crazy only about magic gathered around Shirone. After all, to provide proper commentary, you needed to be at the right level, didn't you?

Led by Dante, Closer and Sabina walked over. On the opposite side, Canis and Arin could be seen, with Boyle and Pandora following behind. Finally, Mark, who definitely knew how to utilize his senior connections, boldly entered the premium seats bringing Maria along.

Excluding Mark and Maria, the definitive final ten who were certain to be the next graduating class had gathered in one place. Since it would be impossible for anyone to knock out one of them and enter the graduating class themselves, their peers frowned just seeing them all together.

Dante asked with a smirk, "How does it feel to send your girlfriend off to the battlefield?"

Shirone looked down at the arena.

"Well, I'm not sure yet. What do you think?"

At that, Dante also turned toward the arena and said, "There seems to be some difference in skill level among the participants. Based purely on objective abilities, she'd easily make it into the top ten. But as much as that's true, variables will play a major role depending on what the test subjects are. Unexpected situations usually arise from asymmetries in power."

Since Dante majored in information processing, Shirone couldn't argue with his assessment.

While the two were talking, Sabina raised her hand to Nade.

"Hi?"

"Oh, hi."

Since they weren't particularly close enough to exchange special greetings, Nade responded perfunctorily.

Sabina stood there for quite a while as if waiting for something else to be said, but when Nade showed no interest, she sat down dejectedly next to Dante. Pandora's snickering could be heard.

"Seniors, it's starting."

Thirty students participating in the graduation exam stood in a row in the center of the colosseum. All were wearing Image Zone bracelets.

However, spectators had no problem viewing even without the bracelets. The location for graduation exams was required by national regulations to be designed with the highest grade Image Zone. The entire colosseum was like one giant Image Zone.

Arin clasped her hands together and prayed for Amy's success. Canis frowned and said, "Does that kind of thing help? If you could pass through prayer, anyone would become a mage. Besides, you don't even believe in god, do you?"

"Tch! Even so, I'm nervous. Don't you want Amy to pass, Canis?"

"What do I care who passes? It's not my exam."

Arin glared at Canis with hurt feelings. But his gaze was hardly indifferent. As he sat with his chin propped up, looking at the arena, Amy came into view. Seeing her burning with pre-battle intensity, he quietly lifted the corner of his mouth.

'Give it your best shot, pumpkin.'

The teaching staff took their seats with Alpheas and Olivia at the center, with parents on the left and scouts and correspondents on the right.

After Alpheas's opening remarks ended, Olivia explained the test evaluation categories.

The exam was divided into first and second rounds, with two out of six categories chosen by roulette. Since no one knew what would come up, students had no choice but to train evenly in all categories.

It was a regulation established to ensure fairness with non-combat mages, and consideration from the Magic Association to give slightly more weight to repeat students.

The preliminary events concluded with the students swearing to compete fairly.

As the thirty participants stood in a circle along the colosseum walls, Sad, who was in charge of proceedings, shouted from the podium.

"We will now begin the Alpheas Magic School graduation examination!"

A massive circular hologram appeared in the colosseum's sky. Six categories were divided in exact proportions, and the central pointer began spinning at high speed.

The participants clenched their fists and performed sequence magic.

The Image Zone would activate the moment the pointer stopped. They would need to move simultaneously with judgment.

Finally, the pointer indicated the first test category.

"Waaaaaaah!"

The crowd's cheers filled the colosseum.

* * *

Night had fallen.

People poured out of the colosseum exits in droves. All had excited faces. Shirone's group also didn't speak a word until they came outside.

At the colosseum exit, Nade turned to look at Shirone.

"What will you do, Shirone? Iruki and I are hungry and need to get something to eat."

"Yeah. Go ahead. I'll go with Amy."

"Alright then. See you tomorrow."

After seeing his friends off, Shirone blew white breath while cooling his heated insides. When light came from the colosseum direction, he turned around. The names of the successful candidates appeared on the electronic board. From first to tenth place. A total of ten students would become mages and leave for the outside world.

1st Place: Olt Amira
2nd Place: Ludwig Aconel  
3rd Place: Cony Kale
4th Place: Tanto Selena
5th Place: Ekins Samuel
6th Place: Aresa Depo
7th Place: Fortress Seriel
8th Place: Lara Coril
9th Place: Andres Raul
10th Place: Dolin Rixton

Amy's name wasn't there.

She had been eliminated third as soon as the first test began.

The first evaluation category was combat power measurement. Since it favored combat mages, students focused their attacks on Amy. No, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call it a one-sided lynching. Before Seriel could even try to help, Amy's mental power gauge hit zero.

It was a result that defied expert analysis, but this too was a variable in graduation exams. Amy must have anticipated this and prepared thoroughly accordingly.

That's why it felt unsettling.

Collusion could be understood as a natural process during combat. When one side's power grows, the weak have no choice but to band together. But was it just imagination that it felt like the strong ones had colluded?

At first it was a chaotic battle. Amy wasn't the only one aspiring to combat magic, and with thirty participants, firepower was bound to be dispersed.

But when Fermi's group began taking action, the tide turned dramatically.

They targeted only Amy. While dodging all the other students' attacks.

When this continued for about a minute, even students who hadn't realized it at first would understand—siding with Fermi's group made the situation easier.

Eventually everyone except Seriel attacked Amy, and in such circumstances, even the mighty Amy had no way to hold out. It was a tactic impossible unless Fermi's group's combat power exceeded the combined combat power of all other participants.

Could this really be called natural collusion?

What was truly strange was that none of Fermi's group managed to pass the exam. Rather, when clashing with Samuel, it even felt like they were deliberately losing.

'Samuel.'

Most students noticed it, but there were several instances in the first test where Fermi's group seemed to be supporting Samuel. However, the feeling was so subtle that it was ambiguous to make a judgment.

The brutality of graduation exams? There were too many strange points to dismiss it as such. Above all, it was unsettling that at the center of all suspicions was Fermi, who hadn't lost first place once in six years.

'Maybe it's just my imagination. There's no guarantee such cases don't occur on battlefields. No, even if it's not imagination, would anything change?'

Simply thinking about it, in combat power measurement, the side with stronger combat power won. Even if it was the result of artificial collusion, it couldn't become a different standard for evaluating the category.

'Unless there was personal compensation involved.'

There was also the possibility of some kind of agreement between Fermi and Samuel.

But Shirone hastily erased the thought. If he was wrong, it would be a great discourtesy to Samuel. Moreover, if such a thing had happened, the teaching staff would have already begun investigating.

'Right, no matter how much I think about it, there's nothing I can do about it.'

Right now he was only worried about Amy.

Since she was eliminated early, her mental power would have already recovered. But thinking about her feelings having to watch the exam from the waiting room for such a long time made his heart heavy.

Amy's parents came out from the parent-only exit. Shirone approached them, not knowing what expression to wear.

"Shirone..."

Isis greeted Shirone with moist eyes. Not only the red-eyed Shakora but Isis too was a famous dancer, so there was no way she wouldn't have noticed the strange aspects of the combat situation.

"Shirone, how could this happen? For Amy to be eliminated. This is just like..."

"Dear, watch your words. How do you think Amy would feel hearing such talk?"

Shakora warned his wife to watch her tongue.

He too thought there were aspects that raised suspicion. But nothing strange enough to exceed normal parameters.

Except for Fermi's entire group being eliminated, the flow of battle was rational and reasonable. Moreover, since the second test was a non-combat category, one couldn't argue that Fermi's group's elimination was unnatural.

Shirone watched the exam failures emerge and swallowed dryly. When he saw Amy coming out in the middle group, his mind went blank.

Amy looked at Shirone once, then approached her parents. And with an eye-smile, she stuck out her tongue playfully.

"Hehe, Dad, Mom. Sorry. I got eliminated quite spectacularly."

"It's an exam, so it can't be helped. You did your best. So don't be too disheartened."

"Disheartened? What for. Ah, I think I made a poor judgment. I'll have to try again next year."

Shirone felt relieved by Amy's bright demeanor, but was also worried on another level.

Her mood couldn't possibly be normal. She was considering her family's feelings first.

This time the successful candidates emerged. Seriel approached Amy while crying profusely.

"Amy, Amy..."

Amy was genuinely happy about her friend's success.

How could she not be? Today Seriel had graduated from magic school and taken her first step as a mage.

"Congratulations, Seriel. Work hard for my share too. I'll catch up soon."

Seriel shook her head.

Why was it her and not Amy? No matter who looked at it, Amy should have been the one to pass.

She should have noticed sooner. If she had quickly sided with Amy when Fermi's group was lynching her, the flow of battle might have been different.

"Amy... I..."

Amy grabbed Seriel's shoulders.

"Seriel, get it together. You passed the exam. Do you understand what that means? You took your graduation exam, and I took mine. And you passed. Nothing else matters."

Seriel struggled to hold back her tears.

She mustn't cry. How could she cry when Amy wasn't crying?
