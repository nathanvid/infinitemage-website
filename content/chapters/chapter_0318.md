"I'm sorry. But I'm so frustrated. I know it's wrong for someone who passed to say this to you, but..."

"It's okay. I would have felt the same way. This isn't the only exam. I'm the one who should apologize. And I don't think I'll be able to go to the party."

It was the school's tradition for those who passed the graduation exam to gather and hold a graduation party. Anyone could attend, but those who failed had never come even once. There was no need to show up and dampen the mood of those who had passed.

"What's the point of such a party now? I won't go either!"

Amy looked at Seriel with loving eyes. Though she herself had been eliminated early, she was proud of her friend who had fought to the end through the turbulent flow and achieved her dream.

"Promise me, Seriel. Promise you'll go to the party. If you don't enjoy this moment, I won't be able to feel happy even if I pass next year. I don't want to steal away a joy that comes only once in a lifetime. Smile proudly for my sake."

Seriel pressed her lips together tightly and nodded.

For Amy, who would have to fight for another year, this was more important than anything. She could readily give up any slight feelings of self-reproach for the sake of her friend.

"Alright. I won't think about anything else. I'll really play until I die and fully enjoy my success. So you absolutely have to pass too."

"Good, that's exactly right. Thank you, Seriel."

A teacher shouted from the dim distance.

"All successful candidates, gather now! There will be an orientation! Quickly! There's no time!"

The reality of passing would probably only sink in when tomorrow morning's sun rose. Moreover, they would be busy with the graduation party late into the night, so there was no better time than now to get the orientation out of the way.

"Go ahead. I'll see you at the graduation ceremony."

"Okay. You go in and get some good rest too."

Before leaving, Seriel glanced back at Shirone.

She knew that Amy was consciously avoiding eye contact with Shirone. That's why Shirone was the only one who could look after her until the end.

Shirone nodded as if to say not to worry. Only then did Seriel feel relieved, bid farewell to Amy's parents, and run toward where the successful candidates had gathered.

Amy watched her friend's retreating figure with satisfaction, then let out a big sigh.

"Phew, I'm tired. Mom and Dad should go home quickly now too."

"Will you be alright? How about going out somewhere instead? Mom can talk to the school for you."

"Oh, forget it. I'm not the only one who failed, so why all the fuss? It's vacation soon anyway, so we can see each other at home."

Shakora, understanding her daughter's heart, said, "Then we'll head back. We'll send a carriage on graduation day, so rest well today."

"Okay. Be careful going home, Dad."

Isis turned around first. She could no longer suppress the tears she had been holding back all this time.

Shakora, who had been following his wife, looked back at Shirone.

"Shirone."

"Yes. Don't worry and head home."

Shakora conveyed his gratitude with his eyes and walked away. In this situation, parental comfort wouldn't help at all. He was relieved that Shirone was by her side.

Left alone with Amy, Shirone didn't say anything. If she asked him something, he would answer. But if she remained silent, he intended to respect that silence.

"Argh! This is really driving me crazy! I failed again!"

"Damn! What rotten luck! Just how many times am I going to take the graduation exam!"

Rough silhouettes emerged from the coliseum with delinquent gaits. Shirone could tell just from their voices that it was Fermi's group.

Fermi, who spotted Amy, changed direction and approached. Even though he had failed the exam seven times including this one, there was no sign of disappointment on his face.

"Well, well, it's awkward meeting fellow failures again. Don't be too heartbroken, little miss. That's just how life is. Same for me. How about it? Want to join us today and..."

Shirone moved to the side and blocked Fermi's path. When cold eyes met his, Fermi scratched his head and put on an act.

"What a punchable face. But cut me some slack today. That little miss over there beat me up so bad my whole body aches. This always happens when the top rankers clash early on. My life's gotten all twisted up too."

Fermi put up a defensive barrier in advance and gauged Shirone's reaction. But no words came from Shirone's mouth.

Then Fermi turned his attention back to Amy.

"Haha! Anyway Amy, what should we..."

Shirone blocked Fermi again.

This time, Fermi didn't stay still either. His eyes turned cold for just a moment as he looked down at Shirone with an overbearing gaze.

Shirone let even that gaze flow past him calmly. Whatever he said would only hurt Amy. He hoped Fermi wouldn't approach her.

"Having a boyfriend must be nice. Well, whatever... you two have a good time together."

Fermi turned around without lingering and walked away. Joining up with his group, he put his arms around their shoulders and shouted loud enough to wake the world.

"Let's go! Let's go drink, you pathetic lives!"

"Bwahahaha! Yeah! Let's drink ourselves to death today!"

Shirone looked back at Amy. She had turned away from the beginning, showing no interest, and was gazing into the distance.

"Let's go, Amy. I'll walk you back."

"...Yeah."

A heavy silence flowed between the two as they headed toward the graduating class dormitory.

Amy, who had been walking while looking only at the ground, frowned and turned to look at Shirone.

"Ugh, this is really unbearable. Hey!"

"Yeah?"

"Why have you been so down since earlier? That's making me feel weird too. If you have something to say, say it. What are you so dissatisfied about?"

"But there isn't really anything to say."

"That's exactly it. I just failed the graduation exam. I'm not the only one in the world who failed, and even if I were the only one, it doesn't mean my life is over. So why are you making the atmosphere so heavy?"

When Amy said that, Shirone gained courage too.

"Haha! That's true. Anyway, does this mean I get another chance too?"

"Hmph, you better be grateful. I absolutely won't make mistakes like this again."

"One mistake is the foundation of improvement, two mistakes are the family's shame?"

"Of course. And tell your stupid friends clearly too. Next year's graduating class will be incredibly brutal. I'll have to crush their spirits right from the start."

To Shirone, Amy's words sounded like this: Tell them I'm sorry for disappointing them.

But she didn't need to worry. Nade and Iruki were confident that Amy would make a comeback.

The two returned to their usual selves, chatting about various things as they arrived at the dormitory. Although she had failed the exam, it was liberating that the tension built up over a year had disappeared.

"Ah, I'm tired. I need to go in, wash up, and sleep quickly."

"Yeah, don't think about anything today and just rest."

"Okay. See you tomorrow. Thanks for walking me back."

Amy, with a tired face, bid farewell to Shirone and entered the dormitory. The air in the hallway was quite different from that morning. She could even feel a chill somehow.

As soon as Amy entered her room and closed the door, she let out a sigh. No matter how tired she was, she had sweated a lot and needed to wash up.

But her steps toward the shower eventually came to a stop. Transparent tears flowed from her eyes.

"Sob! Sniff...!"

She was frustrated.

So frustrated she felt like dying.

Why me? One-third pass, and ten people I studied with are now mages, so why am I the only one who isn't?

My condition was perfect too, so why am I still at school? Why do I have to go through this hellish year again?

Amy collapsed on her bed and clutched her blanket. She couldn't stop her face from crumpling into tears.

"Waaaah... Waaaaaaah!"

Shirone took his hand off the door handle and leaned his back against the wall. It seemed he couldn't see her anymore today.

"Waaaah... Waaaaaaah..."

Amy's crying was rough, as if she couldn't breathe.

"..."

But Shirone just looked up at the ceiling with deep eyes, standing guard for a long time.

Even long past lights-out, the annex of Alpheas was still lit. Olivia's angry voice leaked out through the window.

"Does this make any sense? Just how did you manage the students?"

Olivia, who had supervised Alpheas Magic School's graduation exam for the first time, was shocked. And as soon as the exam ended, she thoroughly investigated the students' personal records in the archives.

"These kids here!"

Olivia shook the personal record sheets before throwing them onto the table where Alpheas sat.

The papers stuck and spread left and right, revealing the names of several students.

It was Fermi's gang.

Alpheas briefly glanced at the profiles before opening his mouth with apparent disinterest.

"Calm down. The exam is already over. It's irreversible, and there's no reason it should be reversed."

"Why is there no reason? The participants colluded!"

"Collusion is also part of tactics. Situational judgment is also an important factor in combat."

"Who doesn't know that? The problem is that it was collusion separate from tactical flow. They had already chosen sides before even taking the exam. Why on earth? What do they gain from doing that?"

Alpheas couldn't answer that either. It had been happening every year since Fermi entered the graduating class.

In a battle royal format, targeting specific individuals for elimination doesn't particularly benefit anyone. Most strange of all was that they themselves eventually failed too.

"The graduation exam isn't just the school's issue. It's an exam for obtaining national certification. Even tactical flow is like that. A single teacher's personal judgment can't change the standards for passing."

Olivia snorted.

"Do you think my eyes are rotten fish eyes? Fermi didn't show even half his ability in this exam. He's a kid who could already be a pro. He's someone who could graduate immediately even if placed at the Royal Magic School, yet he hasn't passed for six years. Does that make sense?"

"Then what should we do? Just graduate Fermi? Then why would we even need graduation exams? Such methods would only create backlash from the students taking the exam."

Olivia paced around the room in frustration before flopping down on the sofa.

"I can't understand it. Why won't he graduate? What's good about staying at school?"

"I asked him once before. He said something about this place being profitable."

Olivia's upper body bounced up.

"That's graduation certificate brokering! If he's taking money to help people graduate, it's not something that can end with just school-level discipline. He'd be committing crimes against the state."

"I investigated the background, but there was nothing. Not a single penny came out."

Olivia rested her chin on her hand and fell into thought.

If there were no records of receiving bribes, he'd be innocent, but thinking based on circumstantial evidence, it also meant there was something else going on.

"Fermi is... an unorthodox mage, right?"

Alpheas nodded.

"Probably. I don't know how it becomes profitable, but if it's unorthodox magic, we can't investigate it. Unless Fermi casts it himself. But in seven graduation exams, I've never seen it even once."

"Then shouldn't we start from there? Whether he takes money or receives compensation using magic, it's the same thing. I'm only saying this because no one's around, but honestly, Samuel's performance wasn't good today. But he passed. Amy should have taken that spot."

"I had similar thoughts too. But that's something we can only say because no one's around. It's impossible without solid evidence. What if we started an investigation and it turned out to be wrong? Would any noble stay quiet if their child was treated like a criminal?"

Olivia leaned back on the sofa and cooled her heated head with her palms.

"So what are you going to do? Do you have any methods in mind?"

"No. We held the graduation exam like every year, and those who passed become mages. Whether there was lobbying or not, that fact doesn't change."

"But we can't say we accurately measured their abilities."

"Is that really so?"

Olivia raised one eyebrow.

"What do you mean?"
